The\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\nfiles per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach 80 billion Etexts.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\n\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/BU\":  and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

They are England and Scotland, and Ireland.  England and \nScotland form the greater part of these Islands.  Ireland is the \nnext in size.  The little neighbouring islands, which are so small \nupon the Map as to be mere dots, are chiefly little bits of \nScotland, - broken off, I dare say, in the course of a great length \nof time, by the power of the restless water.\n\nIn the old days, a long, long while ago, before Our Saviour was \nborn on earth and lay asleep in a manger, these Islands were in the \nsame place, and the stormy sea roared round them, just as it roars \nnow.  But the sea was not alive, then, with great ships and brave \nsailors, sailing to and from all parts of the world.  It was very \nlonely.  The Islands lay solitary, in the great expanse of water.  \nThe foaming waves dashed against their cliffs, and the bleak winds \nblew over their forests; but the winds and waves brought no \nadventurers to land upon the Islands, and the savage Islanders knew \nnothing of the rest of the world, and the rest of the world knew \nnothing of them.\n\nIt is supposed that the Phoenicians, who were an ancient people, \nfamous for carrying on trade, came in ships to these Islands, and \nfound that they produced tin and lead; both very useful things, as \nyou know, and both produced to this very hour upon the sea-coast. \nThe most celebrated tin mines in Cornwall are, still, close to the \nsea.  One of them, which I have seen, is so close to it that it is \nhollowed out underneath the ocean; and the miners say, that in \nstormy weather, when they are at work down in that deep place, they \ncan hear the noise of the waves thundering above their heads.  So, \nthe Phoenicians, coasting about the Islands, would come, without \nmuch difficulty, to where the tin and lead were.\n\nThe Phoenicians traded with the Islanders for these metals, and \ngave the Islanders some other useful things in exchange.  The \nIslanders were, at first, poor savages, going almost naked, or only \ndressed in the rough skins of beasts, and staining their bodies, as \nother savages do, with coloured earths and the juices of plants.  \nBut the Phoenicians, sailing over to the opposite coasts of France \nand Belgium, and saying to the people there, \'We have been to those \nwhite cliffs across the water, which you can see in fine weather, \nand from that country, which is called BRITAIN, we bring this tin \nand lead,\' tempted some of the French and Belgians to come over \nalso.  These people settled themselves on the south coast of \nEngland, which is now called Kent; and, although they were a rough \npeople too, they taught the savage Britons some useful arts, and \nimproved that part of the Islands.  It is probable that other \npeople came over from Spain to Ireland, and settled there.\n\nThus, by little and little, strangers became mixed with the \nIslanders, and the savage Britons grew into a wild, bold people; \nalmost savage, still, especially in the interior of the country \naway from the sea where the foreign settlers seldom went; but \nhardy, brave, and strong.\n\nThe whole country was covered with forests, and swamps.  The \ngreater part of it was very misty and cold.  There were no roads, \nno bridges, no streets, no houses that you would think deserving of \nthe name.  A town was nothing but a collection of straw-covered \nhuts, hidden in a thick wood, with a ditch all round, and a low \nwall, made of mud, or the trunks of trees placed one upon another.  \nThe people planted little or no corn, but lived upon the flesh of \ntheir flocks and cattle.  They made no coins, but used metal rings \nfor money.  They were clever in basket-work, as savage people often \nare; and they could make a coarse kind of cloth, and some very bad \nearthenware.  But in building fortresses they were much more \nclever.\n\nThey made boats of basket-work, covered with the skins of animals, \nbut seldom, if ever, ventured far from the shore.  They made \nswords, of copper mixed with tin; but, these swords were of an \nawkward shape, and so soft that a heavy blow would bend one.  They \nmade light shields, short pointed daggers, and spears - which they \njerked back after they had thrown them at an enemy, by a long strip \nof leather fastened to the stem.  The butt-end was a rattle, to \nfrighten an enemy\'s horse.  The ancient Britons, being divided into \nas many as thirty or forty tribes, each commanded by its own little \nking, were constantly fighting with one another, as savage people \nusually do; and they always fought with these weapons.\n\nThey were very fond of horses.  The standard of Kent was the \npicture of a white horse.  They could break them in and manage them \nwonderfully well.  Indeed, the horses (of which they had an \nabundance, though they were rather small) were so well taught in \nthose days, that they can scarcely be said to have improved since; \nthough the men are so much wiser.  They understood, and obeyed, \nevery word of command; and would stand still by themselves, in all \nthe din and noise of battle, while their masters went to fight on \nfoot.  The Britons could not have succeeded in their most \nremarkable art, without the aid of these sensible and trusty \nanimals.  The art I mean, is the construction and management of \nwar-chariots or cars, for which they have ever been celebrated in \nhistory.  Each of the best sort of these chariots, not quite breast \nhigh in front, and open at the back, contained one man to drive, \nand two or three others to fight - all standing up.  The horses who \ndrew them were so well trained, that they would tear, at full \ngallop, over the most stony ways, and even through the woods; \ndashing down their masters\' enemies beneath their hoofs, and \ncutting them to pieces with the blades of swords, or scythes, which \nwere fastened to the wheels, and stretched out beyond the car on \neach side, for that cruel purpose.  In a moment, while at full \nspeed, the horses would stop, at the driver\'s command.  The men \nwithin would leap out, deal blows about them with their swords like \nhail, leap on the horses, on the pole, spring back into the \nchariots anyhow; and, as soon as they were safe, the horses tore \naway again.\n\nThe Britons had a strange and terrible religion, called the \nReligion of the Druids.  It seems to have been brought over, in \nvery early times indeed, from the opposite country of France, \nanciently called Gaul, and to have mixed up the worship of the \nSerpent, and of the Sun and Moon, with the worship of some of the \nHeathen Gods and Goddesses.  Most of its ceremonies were kept \nsecret by the priests, the Druids, who pretended to be enchanters, \nand who carried magicians\' wands, and wore, each of them, about his \nneck, what he told the ignorant people was a Serpent\'s egg in a \ngolden case.  But it is certain that the Druidical ceremonies \nincluded the sacrifice of human victims, the torture of some \nsuspected criminals, and, on particular occasions, even the burning \nalive, in immense wicker cages, of a number of men and animals \ntogether.  The Druid Priests had some kind of veneration for the \nOak, and for the mistletoe - the same plant that we hang up in \nhouses at Christmas Time now - when its white berries grew upon the \nOak.  They met together in dark woods, which they called Sacred \nGroves; and there they instructed, in their mysterious arts, young \nmen who came to them as pupils, and who sometimes stayed with them \nas long as twenty years.\n\nThese Druids built great Temples and altars, open to the sky, \nfragments of some of which are yet remaining.  Stonehenge, on \nSalisbury Plain, in Wiltshire, is the most extraordinary of these.  \nThree curious stones, called Kits Coty House, on Bluebell Hill, \nnear Maidstone, in Kent, form another.  We know, from examination \nof the great blocks of which such buildings are made, that they \ncould not have been raised without the aid of some ingenious \nmachines, which are common now, but which the ancient Britons \ncertainly did not use in making their own uncomfortable houses.  I \nshould not wonder if the Druids, and their pupils who stayed with \nthem twenty years, knowing more than the rest of the Britons, kept \nthe people out of sight while they made these buildings, and then \npretended that they built them by magic.  Perhaps they had a hand \nin the fortresses too; at all events, as they were very powerful, \nand very much believed in, and as they made and executed the laws, \nand paid no taxes, I don\'t wonder that they liked their trade.  \nAnd, as they persuaded the people the more Druids there were, the \nbetter off the people would be, I don\'t wonder that there were a \ngood many of them.  But it is pleasant to think that there are no \nDruids, NOW, who go on in that way, and pretend to carry \nEnchanters\' Wands and Serpents\' Eggs - and of course there is \nnothing of the kind, anywhere.\n\nSuch was the improved condition of the ancient Britons, fifty-five \nyears before the birth of Our Saviour, when the Romans, under their \ngreat General, Julius Caesar, were masters of all the rest of the \nknown world.  Julius Caesar had then just conquered Gaul; and \nhearing, in Gaul, a good deal about the opposite Island with the \nwhite cliffs, and about the bravery of the Britons who inhabited it \n- some of whom had been fetched over to help the Gauls in the war \nagainst him - he resolved, as he was so near, to come and conquer \nBritain next.\n\nSo, Julius Caesar came sailing over to this Island of ours, with \neighty vessels and twelve thousand men.  And he came from the \nFrench coast between Calais and Boulogne, \'because thence was the \nshortest passage into Britain;\' just for the same reason as our \nsteam-boats now take the same track, every day.  He expected to \nconquer Britain easily:  but it was not such easy work as he \nsupposed - for the bold Britons fought most bravely; and, what with \nnot having his horse-soldiers with him (for they had been driven \nback by a storm), and what with having some of his vessels dashed \nto pieces by a high tide after they were drawn ashore, he ran great \nrisk of being totally defeated.  However, for once that the bold \nBritons beat him, he beat them twice; though not so soundly but \nthat he was very glad to accept their proposals of peace, and go \naway.\n\nBut, in the spring of the next year, he came back; this time, with \neight hundred vessels and thirty thousand men.  The British tribes \nchose, as their general-in-chief, a Briton, whom the Romans in \ntheir Latin language called CASSIVELLAUNUS, but whose British name \nis supposed to have been CASWALLON.  A brave general he was, and \nwell he and his soldiers fought the Roman army!  So well, that \nwhenever in that war the Roman soldiers saw a great cloud of dust, \nand heard the rattle of the rapid British chariots, they trembled \nin their hearts.  Besides a number of smaller battles, there was a \nbattle fought near Canterbury, in Kent; there was a battle fought \nnear Chertsey, in Surrey; there was a battle fought near a marshy \nlittle town in a wood, the capital of that part of Britain which \nbelonged to CASSIVELLAUNUS, and which was probably near what is now \nSaint Albans, in Hertfordshire.  However, brave CASSIVELLAUNUS had \nthe worst of it, on the whole; though he and his men always fought \nlike lions.  As the other British chiefs were jealous of him, and \nwere always quarrelling with him, and with one another, he gave up, \nand proposed peace.  Julius Caesar was very glad to grant peace \neasily, and to go away again with all his remaining ships and men.  \nHe had expected to find pearls in Britain, and he may have found a \nfew for anything I know; but, at all events, he found delicious \noysters, and I am sure he found tough Britons - of whom, I dare \nsay, he made the same complaint as Napoleon Bonaparte the great \nFrench General did, eighteen hundred years afterwards, when he said \nthey were such unreasonable fellows that they never knew when they \nwere beaten.  They never DID know, I believe, and never will.\n\nNearly a hundred years passed on, and all that time, there was \npeace in Britain.  The Britons improved their towns and mode of \nlife:  became more civilised, travelled, and learnt a great deal \nfrom the Gauls and Romans.  At last, the Roman Emperor, Claudius, \nsent AULUS PLAUTIUS, a skilful general, with a mighty force, to \nsubdue the Island, and shortly afterwards arrived himself.  They \ndid little; and OSTORIUS SCAPULA, another general, came.  Some of \nthe British Chiefs of Tribes submitted.  Others resolved to fight \nto the death.  Of these brave men, the bravest was CARACTACUS, or \nCARADOC, who gave battle to the Romans, with his army, among the \nmountains of North Wales.  \'This day,\' said he to his soldiers, \n\'decides the fate of Britain!  Your liberty, or your eternal \nslavery, dates from this hour.  Remember your brave ancestors, who \ndrove the great Caesar himself across the sea!\'  On hearing these \nwords, his men, with a great shout, rushed upon the Romans.  But \nthe strong Roman swords and armour were too much for the weaker \nBritish weapons in close conflict.  The Britons lost the day.  The \nwife and daughter of the brave CARACTACUS were taken prisoners; his \nbrothers delivered themselves up; he himself was betrayed into the \nhands of the Romans by his false and base stepmother:  and they \ncarried him, and all his family, in triumph to Rome.\n\nBut a great man will be great in misfortune, great in prison, great \nin chains.  His noble air, and dignified endurance of distress, so \ntouched the Roman people who thronged the streets to see him, that \nhe and his family were restored to freedom.  No one knows whether \nhis great heart broke, and he died in Rome, or whether he ever \nreturned to his own dear country.  English oaks have grown up from \nacorns, and withered away, when they were hundreds of years old - \nand other oaks have sprung up in their places, and died too, very \naged - since the rest of the history of the brave CARACTACUS was \nforgotten.\n\nStill, the Britons WOULD NOT yield.  They rose again and again, and \ndied by thousands, sword in hand.  They rose, on every possible \noccasion.  SUETONIUS, another Roman general, came, and stormed the \nIsland of Anglesey (then called MONA), which was supposed to be \nsacred, and he burnt the Druids in their own wicker cages, by their \nown fires.  But, even while he was in Britain, with his victorious \ntroops, the BRITONS rose.  Because BOADICEA, a British queen, the \nwidow of the King of the Norfolk and Suffolk people, resisted the \nplundering of her property by the Romans who were settled in \nEngland, she was scourged, by order of CATUS a Roman officer; and \nher two daughters were shamefully insulted in her presence, and her \nhusband\'s relations were made slaves.  To avenge this injury, the \nBritons rose, with all their might and rage.  They drove CATUS into \nGaul; they laid the Roman possessions waste; they forced the Romans \nout of London, then a poor little town, but a trading place; they \nhanged, burnt, crucified, and slew by the sword, seventy thousand \nRomans in a few days.  SUETONIUS strengthened his army, and \nadvanced to give them battle.  They strengthened their army, and \ndesperately attacked his, on the field where it was strongly \nposted.  Before the first charge of the Britons was made, BOADICEA, \nin a war-chariot, with her fair hair streaming in the wind, and her \ninjured daughters lying at her feet, drove among the troops, and \ncried to them for vengeance on their oppressors, the licentious \nRomans.  The Britons fought to the last; but they were vanquished \nwith great slaughter, and the unhappy queen took poison.\n\nStill, the spirit of the Britons was not broken.  When SUETONIUS \nleft the country, they fell upon his troops, and retook the Island \nof Anglesey.  AGRICOLA came, fifteen or twenty years afterwards, \nand retook it once more, and devoted seven years to subduing the \ncountry, especially that part of it which is now called SCOTLAND; \nbut, its people, the Caledonians, resisted him at every inch of \nground.  They fought the bloodiest battles with him; they killed \ntheir very wives and children, to prevent his making prisoners of \nthem; they fell, fighting, in such great numbers that certain hills \nin Scotland are yet supposed to be vast heaps of stones piled up \nabove their graves.  HADRIAN came, thirty years afterwards, and \nstill they resisted him.  SEVERUS came, nearly a hundred years \nafterwards, and they worried his great army like dogs, and rejoiced \nto see them die, by thousands, in the bogs and swamps.  CARACALLA, \nthe son and successor of SEVERUS, did the most to conquer them, for \na time; but not by force of arms.  He knew how little that would \ndo.  He yielded up a quantity of land to the Caledonians, and gave \nthe Britons the same privileges as the Romans possessed.  There was \npeace, after this, for seventy years.\n\nThen new enemies arose.  They were the Saxons, a fierce, sea-faring \npeople from the countries to the North of the Rhine, the great \nriver of Germany on the banks of which the best grapes grow to make \nthe German wine.  They began to come, in pirate ships, to the sea-\ncoast of Gaul and Britain, and to plunder them.  They were repulsed \nby CARAUSIUS, a native either of Belgium or of Britain, who was \nappointed by the Romans to the command, and under whom the Britons \nfirst began to fight upon the sea.  But, after this time, they \nrenewed their ravages.  A few years more, and the Scots (which was \nthen the name for the people of Ireland), and the Picts, a northern \npeople, began to make frequent plundering incursions into the South \nof Britain.  All these attacks were repeated, at intervals, during \ntwo hundred years, and through a long succession of Roman Emperors \nand chiefs; during all which length of time, the Britons rose \nagainst the Romans, over and over again.  At last, in the days of \nthe Roman HONORIUS, when the Roman power all over the world was \nfast declining, and when Rome wanted all her soldiers at home, the \nRomans abandoned all hope of conquering Britain, and went away.  \nAnd still, at last, as at first, the Britons rose against them, in \ntheir old brave manner; for, a very little while before, they had \nturned away the Roman magistrates, and declared themselves an \nindependent people.\n\nFive hundred years had passed, since Julius Caesar\'s first invasion \nof the Island, when the Romans departed from it for ever.  In the \ncourse of that time, although they had been the cause of terrible \nfighting and bloodshed, they had done much to improve the condition \nof the Britons.  They had made great military roads; they had built \nforts; they had taught them how to dress, and arm themselves, much \nbetter than they had ever known how to do before; they had refined \nthe whole British way of living.  AGRICOLA had built a great wall \nof earth, more than seventy miles long, extending from Newcastle to \nbeyond Carlisle, for the purpose of keeping out the Picts and \nScots; HADRIAN had strengthened it; SEVERUS, finding it much in \nwant of repair, had built it afresh of stone.\n\nAbove all, it was in the Roman time, and by means of Roman ships, \nthat the Christian Religion was first brought into Britain, and its \npeople first taught the great lesson that, to be good in the sight \nof GOD, they must love their neighbours as themselves, and do unto \nothers as they would be done by.  The Druids declared that it was \nvery wicked to believe in any such thing, and cursed all the people \nwho did believe it, very heartily.  But, when the people found that \nthey were none the better for the blessings of the Druids, and none \nthe worse for the curses of the Druids, but, that the sun shone and \nthe rain fell without consulting the Druids at all, they just began \nto think that the Druids were mere men, and that it signified very \nlittle whether they cursed or blessed.  After which, the pupils of \nthe Druids fell off greatly in numbers, and the Druids took to \nother trades.\n\nThus I have come to the end of the Roman time in England.  It is \nbut little that is known of those five hundred years; but some \nremains of them are still found.  Often, when labourers are digging \nup the ground, to make foundations for houses or churches, they \nlight on rusty money that once belonged to the Romans.  Fragments \nof plates from which they ate, of goblets from which they drank, \nand of pavement on which they trod, are discovered among the earth \nthat is broken by the plough, or the dust that is crumbled by the \ngardener\'s spade.  Wells that the Romans sunk, still yield water; \nroads that the Romans made, form part of our highways.  In some old \nbattle-fields, British spear-heads and Roman armour have been \nfound, mingled together in decay, as they fell in the thick \npressure of the fight.  Traces of Roman camps overgrown with grass, \nand of mounds that are the burial-places of heaps of Britons, are \nto be seen in almost all parts of the country.  Across the bleak \nmoors of Northumberland, the wall of SEVERUS, overrun with moss and \nweeds, still stretches, a strong ruin; and the shepherds and their \ndogs lie sleeping on it in the summer weather.  On Salisbury Plain, \nStonehenge yet stands:  a monument of the earlier time when the \nRoman name was unknown in Britain, and when the Druids, with their \nbest magic wands, could not have written it in the sands of the \nwild sea-shore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II - ANCIENT ENGLAND UNDER THE EARLY SAXONS\n\n\n\nTHE Romans had scarcely gone away from Britain, when the Britons \nbegan to wish they had never left it.  For, the Romans being gone, \nand the Britons being much reduced in numbers by their long wars, \nthe Picts and Scots came pouring in, over the broken and unguarded \nwall of SEVERUS, in swarms.  They plundered the richest towns, and \nkilled the people; and came back so often for more booty and more \nslaughter, that the unfortunate Britons lived a life of terror.  As \nif the Picts and Scots were not bad enough on land, the Saxons \nattacked the islanders by sea; and, as if something more were still \nwanting to make them miserable, they quarrelled bitterly among \nthemselves as to what prayers they ought to say, and how they ought \nto say them.  The priests, being very angry with one another on \nthese questions, cursed one another in the heartiest manner; and \n(uncommonly like the old Druids) cursed all the people whom they \ncould not persuade.  So, altogether, the Britons were very badly \noff, you may believe.\n\nThey were in such distress, in short, that they sent a letter to \nRome entreating help - which they called the Groans of the Britons; \nand in which they said, \'The barbarians chase us into the sea, the \nsea throws us back upon the barbarians, and we have only the hard \nchoice left us of perishing by the sword, or perishing by the \nwaves.\'  But, the Romans could not help them, even if they were so \ninclined; for they had enough to do to defend themselves against \ntheir own enemies, who were then very fierce and strong.  At last, \nthe Britons, unable to bear their hard condition any longer, \nresolved to make peace with the Saxons, and to invite the Saxons to \ncome into their country, and help them to keep out the Picts and \nScots.\n\nIt was a British Prince named VORTIGERN who took this resolution, \nand who made a treaty of friendship with HENGIST and HORSA, two \nSaxon chiefs.  Both of these names, in the old Saxon language, \nsignify Horse; for the Saxons, like many other nations in a rough \nstate, were fond of giving men the names of animals, as Horse, \nWolf, Bear, Hound.  The Indians of North America, - a very inferior \npeople to the Saxons, though - do the same to this day.\n\nHENGIST and HORSA drove out the Picts and Scots; and VORTIGERN, \nbeing grateful to them for that service, made no opposition to \ntheir settling themselves in that part of England which is called \nthe Isle of Thanet, or to their inviting over more of their \ncountrymen to join them.  But HENGIST had a beautiful daughter \nnamed ROWENA; and when, at a feast, she filled a golden goblet to \nthe brim with wine, and gave it to VORTIGERN, saying in a sweet \nvoice, \'Dear King, thy health!\' the King fell in love with her.  My \nopinion is, that the cunning HENGIST meant him to do so, in order \nthat the Saxons might have greater influence with him; and that the \nfair ROWENA came to that feast, golden goblet and all, on purpose.\n\nAt any rate, they were married; and, long afterwards, whenever the \nKing was angry with the Saxons, or jealous of their encroachments, \nROWENA would put her beautiful arms round his neck, and softly say, \n\'Dear King, they are my people!  Be favourable to them, as you \nloved that Saxon girl who gave you the golden goblet of wine at the \nfeast!\'  And, really, I don\'t see how the King could help himself.\n\nAh!  We must all die!  In the course of years, VORTIGERN died - he \nwas dethroned, and put in prison, first, I am afraid; and ROWENA \ndied; and generations of Saxons and Britons died; and events that \nhappened during a long, long time, would have been quite forgotten \nbut for the tales and songs of the old Bards, who used to go about \nfrom feast to feast, with their white beards, recounting the deeds \nof their forefathers.  Among the histories of which they sang and \ntalked, there was a famous one, concerning the bravery and virtues \nof KING ARTHUR, supposed to have been a British Prince in those old \ntimes.  But, whether such a person really lived, or whether there \nwere several persons whose histories came to be confused together \nunder that one name, or whether all about him was invention, no one \nknows.\n\nI will tell you, shortly, what is most interesting in the early \nSaxon times, as they are described in these songs and stories of \nthe Bards.\n\nIn, and long after, the days of VORTIGERN, fresh bodies of Saxons, \nunder various chiefs, came pouring into Britain.  One body, \nconquering the Britons in the East, and settling there, called \ntheir kingdom Essex; another body settled in the West, and called \ntheir kingdom Wessex; the Northfolk, or Norfolk people, established \nthemselves in one place; the Southfolk, or Suffolk people, \nestablished themselves in another; and gradually seven kingdoms or \nstates arose in England, which were called the Saxon Heptarchy.  \nThe poor Britons, falling back before these crowds of fighting men \nwhom they had innocently invited over as friends, retired into \nWales and the adjacent country; into Devonshire, and into Cornwall.  \nThose parts of England long remained unconquered.  And in Cornwall \nnow - where the sea-coast is very gloomy, steep, and rugged - \nwhere, in the dark winter-time, ships have often been wrecked close \nto the land, and every soul on board has perished - where the winds \nand waves howl drearily and split the solid rocks into arches and \ncaverns - there are very ancient ruins, which the people call the \nruins of KING ARTHUR\'S Castle.\n\nKent is the most famous of the seven Saxon kingdoms, because the \nChristian religion was preached to the Saxons there (who domineered \nover the Britons too much, to care for what THEY said about their \nreligion, or anything else) by AUGUSTINE, a monk from Rome.  KING \nETHELBERT, of Kent, was soon converted; and the moment he said he \nwas a Christian, his courtiers all said THEY were Christians; after \nwhich, ten thousand of his subjects said they were Christians too.  \nAUGUSTINE built a little church, close to this King\'s palace, on \nthe ground now occupied by the beautiful cathedral of Canterbury.  \nSEBERT, the King\'s nephew, built on a muddy marshy place near \nLondon, where there had been a temple to Apollo, a church dedicated \nto Saint Peter, which is now Westminster Abbey.  And, in London \nitself, on the foundation of a temple to Diana, he built another \nlittle church which has risen up, since that old time, to be Saint \nPaul\'s.\n\nAfter the death of ETHELBERT, EDWIN, King of Northumbria, who was \nsuch a good king that it was said a woman or child might openly \ncarry a purse of gold, in his reign, without fear, allowed his \nchild to be baptised, and held a great council to consider whether \nhe and his people should all be Christians or not.  It was decided \nthat they should be.  COIFI, the chief priest of the old religion, \nmade a great speech on the occasion.  In this discourse, he told \nthe people that he had found out the old gods to be impostors.  \'I \nam quite satisfied of it,\' he said.  \'Look at me!  I have been \nserving them all my life, and they have done nothing for me; \nwhereas, if they had been really powerful, they could not have \ndecently done less, in return for all I have done for them, than \nmake my fortune.  As they have never made my fortune, I am quite \nconvinced they are impostors!\'  When this singular priest had \nfinished speaking, he hastily armed himself with sword and lance, \nmounted a war-horse, rode at a furious gallop in sight of all the \npeople to the temple, and flung his lance against it as an insult.  \nFrom that time, the Christian religion spread itself among the \nSaxons, and became their faith.\n\nThe next very famous prince was EGBERT.  He lived about a hundred \nand fifty years afterwards, and claimed to have a better right to \nthe throne of Wessex than BEORTRIC, another Saxon prince who was at \nthe head of that kingdom, and who married EDBURGA, the daughter of \nOFFA, king of another of the seven kingdoms.  This QUEEN EDBURGA \nwas a handsome murderess, who poisoned people when they offended \nher.  One day, she mixed a cup of poison for a certain noble \nbelonging to the court; but her husband drank of it too, by \nmistake, and died.  Upon this, the people revolted, in great \ncrowds; and running to the palace, and thundering at the gates, \ncried, \'Down with the wicked queen, who poisons men!\'  They drove \nher out of the country, and abolished the title she had disgraced.  \nWhen years had passed away, some travellers came home from Italy, \nand said that in the town of Pavia they had seen a ragged beggar-\nwoman, who had once been handsome, but was then shrivelled, bent, \nand yellow, wandering about the streets, crying for bread; and that \nthis beggar-woman was the poisoning English queen.  It was, indeed, \nEDBURGA; and so she died, without a shelter for her wretched head.\n\nEGBERT, not considering himself safe in England, in consequence of \nhis having claimed the crown of Wessex (for he thought his rival \nmight take him prisoner and put him to death), sought refuge at the \ncourt of CHARLEMAGNE, King of France.  On the death of BEORTRIC, so \nunhappily poisoned by mistake, EGBERT came back to Britain; \nsucceeded to the throne of Wessex; conquered some of the other \nmonarchs of the seven kingdoms; added their territories to his own; \nand, for the first time, called the country over which he ruled, \nENGLAND.\n\nAnd now, new enemies arose, who, for a long time, troubled England \nsorely.  These were the Northmen, the people of Denmark and Norway, \nwhom the English called the Danes.  They were a warlike people, \nquite at home upon the sea; not Christians; very daring and cruel.  \nThey came over in ships, and plundered and burned wheresoever they \nlanded.  Once, they beat EGBERT in battle.  Once, EGBERT beat them.  \nBut, they cared no more for being beaten than the English \nthemselves.  In the four following short reigns, of ETHELWULF, and \nhis sons, ETHELBALD, ETHELBERT, and ETHELRED, they came back, over \nand over again, burning and plundering, and laying England waste.  \nIn the last-mentioned reign, they seized EDMUND, King of East \nEngland, and bound him to a tree.  Then, they proposed to him that \nhe should change his religion; but he, being a good Christian, \nsteadily refused.  Upon that, they beat him, made cowardly jests \nupon him, all defenceless as he was, shot arrows at him, and, \nfinally, struck off his head.  It is impossible to say whose head \nthey might have struck off next, but for the death of KING ETHELRED \nfrom a wound he had received in fighting against them, and the \nsuccession to his throne of the best and wisest king that ever \nlived in England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III - ENGLAND UNDER THE GOOD SAXON, ALFRED\n\n\n\nALFRED THE GREAT was a young man, three-and-twenty years of age, \nwhen he became king.  Twice in his childhood, he had been taken to \nRome, where the Saxon nobles were in the habit of going on journeys \nwhich they supposed to be religious; and, once, he had stayed for \nsome time in Paris.  Learning, however, was so little cared for, \nthen, that at twelve years old he had not been taught to read; \nalthough, of the sons of KING ETHELWULF, he, the youngest, was the \nfavourite.  But he had - as most men who grow up to be great and \ngood are generally found to have had - an excellent mother; and, \none day, this lady, whose name was OSBURGA, happened, as she was \nsitting among her sons, to read a book of Saxon poetry.  The art of \nprinting was not known until long and long after that period, and \nthe book, which was written, was what is called \'illuminated,\' with \nbeautiful bright letters, richly painted.  The brothers admiring it \nvery much, their mother said, \'I will give it to that one of you \nfour princes who first learns to read.\'  ALFRED sought out a tutor \nthat very day, applied himself to learn with great diligence, and \nsoon won the book.  He was proud of it, all his life.\n\nThis great king, in the first year of his reign, fought nine \nbattles with the Danes.  He made some treaties with them too, by \nwhich the false Danes swore they would quit the country.  They \npretended to consider that they had taken a very solemn oath, in \nswearing this upon the holy bracelets that they wore, and which \nwere always buried with them when they died; but they cared little \nfor it, for they thought nothing of breaking oaths and treaties \ntoo, as soon as it suited their purpose, and coming back again to \nfight, plunder, and burn, as usual.  One fatal winter, in the \nfourth year of KING ALFRED\'S reign, they spread themselves in great \nnumbers over the whole of England; and so dispersed and routed the \nKing\'s soldiers that the King was left alone, and was obliged to \ndisguise himself as a common peasant, and to take refuge in the \ncottage of one of his cowherds who did not know his face.\n\nHere, KING ALFRED, while the Danes sought him far and near, was \nleft alone one day, by the cowherd\'s wife, to watch some cakes \nwhich she put to bake upon the hearth.  But, being at work upon his \nbow and arrows, with which he hoped to punish the false Danes when \na brighter time should come, and thinking deeply of his poor \nunhappy subjects whom the Danes chased through the land, his noble \nmind forgot the cakes, and they were burnt.  \'What!\' said the \ncowherd\'s wife, who scolded him well when she came back, and little \nthought she was scolding the King, \'you will be ready enough to eat \nthem by-and-by, and yet you cannot watch them, idle dog?\'\n\nAt length, the Devonshire men made head against a new host of Danes \nwho landed on their coast; killed their chief, and captured their \nflag; on which was represented the likeness of a Raven - a very fit \nbird for a thievish army like that, I think.  The loss of their \nstandard troubled the Danes greatly, for they believed it to be \nenchanted - woven by the three daughters of one father in a single \nafternoon - and they had a story among themselves that when they \nwere victorious in battle, the Raven stretched his wings and seemed \nto fly; and that when they were defeated, he would droop.  He had \ngood reason to droop, now, if he could have done anything half so \nsensible; for, KING ALFRED joined the Devonshire men; made a camp \nwith them on a piece of firm ground in the midst of a bog in \nSomersetshire; and prepared for a great attempt for vengeance on \nthe Danes, and the deliverance of his oppressed people.\n\nBut, first, as it was important to know how numerous those \npestilent Danes were, and how they were fortified, KING ALFRED, \nbeing a good musician, disguised himself as a glee-man or minstrel, \nand went, with his harp, to the Danish camp.  He played and sang in \nthe very tent of GUTHRUM the Danish leader, and entertained the \nDanes as they caroused.  While he seemed to think of nothing but \nhis music, he was watchful of their tents, their arms, their \ndiscipline, everything that he desired to know.  And right soon did \nthis great king entertain them to a different tune; for, summoning \nall his true followers to meet him at an appointed place, where \nthey received him with joyful shouts and tears, as the monarch whom \nmany of them had given up for lost or dead, he put himself at their \nhead, marched on the Danish camp, defeated the Danes with great \nslaughter, and besieged them for fourteen days to prevent their \nescape.  But, being as merciful as he was good and brave, he then, \ninstead of killing them, proposed peace:  on condition that they \nshould altogether depart from that Western part of England, and \nsettle in the East; and that GUTHRUM should become a Christian, in \nremembrance of the Divine religion which now taught his conqueror, \nthe noble ALFRED, to forgive the enemy who had so often injured \nhim.  This, GUTHRUM did.  At his baptism, KING ALFRED was his \ngodfather.  And GUTHRUM was an honourable chief who well deserved \nthat clemency; for, ever afterwards he was loyal and faithful to \nthe king.  The Danes under him were faithful too.  They plundered \nand burned no more, but worked like honest men.  They ploughed, and \nsowed, and reaped, and led good honest English lives.  And I hope \nthe children of those Danes played, many a time, with Saxon \nchildren in the sunny fields; and that Danish young men fell in \nlove with Saxon girls, and married them; and that English \ntravellers, benighted at the doors of Danish cottages, often went \nin for shelter until morning; and that Danes and Saxons sat by the \nred fire, friends, talking of KING ALFRED THE GREAT.\n\nAll the Danes were not like these under GUTHRUM; for, after some \nyears, more of them came over, in the old plundering and burning \nway - among them a fierce pirate of the name of HASTINGS, who had \nthe boldness to sail up the Thames to Gravesend, with eighty ships.  \nFor three years, there was a war with these Danes; and there was a \nfamine in the country, too, and a plague, both upon human creatures \nand beasts.  But KING ALFRED, whose mighty heart never failed him, \nbuilt large ships nevertheless, with which to pursue the pirates on \nthe sea; and he encouraged his soldiers, by his brave example, to \nfight valiantly against them on the shore.  At last, he drove them \nall away; and then there was repose in England.\n\nAs great and good in peace, as he was great and good in war, KING \nALFRED never rested from his labours to improve his people.  He \nloved to talk with clever men, and with travellers from foreign \ncountries, and to write down what they told him, for his people to \nread.  He had studied Latin after learning to read English, and now \nanother of his labours was, to translate Latin books into the \nEnglish-Saxon tongue, that his people might be interested, and \nimproved by their contents.  He made just laws, that they might \nlive more happily and freely; he turned away all partial judges, \nthat no wrong might be done them; he was so careful of their \nproperty, and punished robbers so severely, that it was a common \nthing to say that under the great KING ALFRED, garlands of golden \nchains and jewels might have hung across the streets, and no man \nwould have touched one.  He founded schools; he patiently heard \ncauses himself in his Court of Justice; the great desires of his \nheart were, to do right to all his subjects, and to leave England \nbetter, wiser, happier in all ways, than he found it.  His industry \nin these efforts was quite astonishing.  Every day he divided into \ncertain portions, and in each portion devoted himself to a certain \npursuit.  That he might divide his time exactly, he had wax torches \nor candles made, which were all of the same size, were notched \nacross at regular distances, and were always kept burning.  Thus, \nas the candles burnt down, he divided the day into notches, almost \nas accurately as we now divide it into hours upon the clock.  But \nwhen the candles were first invented, it was found that the wind \nand draughts of air, blowing into the palace through the doors and \nwindows, and through the chinks in the walls, caused them to gutter \nand burn unequally.  To prevent this, the King had them put into \ncases formed of wood and white horn.  And these were the first \nlanthorns ever made in England.\n\nAll this time, he was afflicted with a terrible unknown disease, \nwhich caused him violent and frequent pain that nothing could \nrelieve.  He bore it, as he had borne all the troubles of his life, \nlike a brave good man, until he was fifty-three years old; and \nthen, having reigned thirty years, he died.  He died in the year \nnine hundred and one; but, long ago as that is, his fame, and the \nlove and gratitude with which his subjects regarded him, are \nfreshly remembered to the present hour.\n\nIn the next reign, which was the reign of EDWARD, surnamed THE \nELDER, who was chosen in council to succeed, a nephew of KING \nALFRED troubled the country by trying to obtain the throne.  The \nDanes in the East of England took part with this usurper (perhaps \nbecause they had honoured his uncle so much, and honoured him for \nhis uncle\'s sake), and there was hard fighting; but, the King, with \nthe assistance of his sister, gained the day, and reigned in peace \nfor four and twenty years.  He gradually extended his power over \nthe whole of England, and so the Seven Kingdoms were united into \none.\n\nWhen England thus became one kingdom, ruled over by one Saxon king, \nthe Saxons had been settled in the country more than four hundred \nand fifty years.  Great changes had taken place in its customs \nduring that time.  The Saxons were still greedy eaters and great \ndrinkers, and their feasts were often of a noisy and drunken kind; \nbut many new comforts and even elegances had become known, and were \nfast increasing.  Hangings for the walls of rooms, where, in these \nmodern days, we paste up paper, are known to have been sometimes \nmade of silk, ornamented with birds and flowers in needlework.  \nTables and chairs were curiously carved in different woods; were \nsometimes decorated with gold or silver; sometimes even made of \nthose precious metals.  Knives and spoons were used at table; \ngolden ornaments were worn - with silk and cloth, and golden \ntissues and embroideries; dishes were made of gold and silver, \nbrass and bone.  There were varieties of drinking-horns, bedsteads, \nmusical instruments.  A harp was passed round, at a feast, like the \ndrinking-bowl, from guest to guest; and each one usually sang or \nplayed when his turn came.  The weapons of the Saxons were stoutly \nmade, and among them was a terrible iron hammer that gave deadly \nblows, and was long remembered.  The Saxons themselves were a \nhandsome people.  The men were proud of their long fair hair, \nparted on the forehead; their ample beards, their fresh \ncomplexions, and clear eyes.  The beauty of the Saxon women filled \nall England with a new delight and grace.\n\nI have more to tell of the Saxons yet, but I stop to say this now, \nbecause under the GREAT ALFRED, all the best points of the English-\nSaxon character were first encouraged, and in him first shown.  It \nhas been the greatest character among the nations of the earth.  \nWherever the descendants of the Saxon race have gone, have sailed, \nor otherwise made their way, even to the remotest regions of the \nworld, they have been patient, persevering, never to be broken in \nspirit, never to be turned aside from enterprises on which they \nhave resolved.  In Europe, Asia, Africa, America, the whole world \nover; in the desert, in the forest, on the sea; scorched by a \nburning sun, or frozen by ice that never melts; the Saxon blood \nremains unchanged.  Wheresoever that race goes, there, law, and \nindustry, and safety for life and property, and all the great \nresults of steady perseverance, are certain to arise.\n\nI pause to think with admiration, of the noble king who, in his \nsingle person, possessed all the Saxon virtues.  Whom misfortune \ncould not subdue, whom prosperity could not spoil, whose \nperseverance nothing could shake.  Who was hopeful in defeat, and \ngenerous in success.  Who loved justice, freedom, truth, and \nknowledge.  Who, in his care to instruct his people, probably did \nmore to preserve the beautiful old Saxon language, than I can \nimagine.  Without whom, the English tongue in which I tell this \nstory might have wanted half its meaning.  As it is said that his \nspirit still inspires some of our best English laws, so, let you \nand I pray that it may animate our English hearts, at least to this \n- to resolve, when we see any of our fellow-creatures left in \nignorance, that we will do our best, while life is in us, to have \nthem taught; and to tell those rulers whose duty it is to teach \nthem, and who neglect their duty, that they have profited very \nlittle by all the years that have rolled away since the year nine \nhundred and one, and that they are far behind the bright example of \nKING ALFRED THE GREAT.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV - ENGLAND UNDER ATHELSTAN AND THE SIX BOY-KINGS\n\n\n\nATHELSTAN, the son of Edward the Elder, succeeded that king.  He \nreigned only fifteen years; but he remembered the glory of his \ngrandfather, the great Alfred, and governed England well.  He \nreduced the turbulent people of Wales, and obliged them to pay him \na tribute in money, and in cattle, and to send him their best hawks \nand hounds.  He was victorious over the Cornish men, who were not \nyet quite under the Saxon government.  He restored such of the old \nlaws as were good, and had fallen into disuse; made some wise new \nlaws, and took care of the poor and weak.  A strong alliance, made \nagainst him by ANLAF a Danish prince, CONSTANTINE King of the \nScots, and the people of North Wales, he broke and defeated in one \ngreat battle, long famous for the vast numbers slain in it.  After \nthat, he had a quiet reign; the lords and ladies about him had \nleisure to become polite and agreeable; and foreign princes were \nglad (as they have sometimes been since) to come to England on \nvisits to the English court.\n\nWhen Athelstan died, at forty-seven years old, his brother EDMUND, \nwho was only eighteen, became king.  He was the first of six boy-\nkings, as you will presently know.\n\nThey called him the Magnificent, because he showed a taste for \nimprovement and refinement.  But he was beset by the Danes, and had \na short and troubled reign, which came to a troubled end.  One \nnight, when he was feasting in his hall, and had eaten much and \ndrunk deep, he saw, among the company, a noted robber named LEOF, \nwho had been banished from England.  Made very angry by the \nboldness of this man, the King turned to his cup-bearer, and said, \n\'There is a robber sitting at the table yonder, who, for his \ncrimes, is an outlaw in the land - a hunted wolf, whose life any \nman may take, at any time.  Command that robber to depart!\'  \'I \nwill not depart!\' said Leof.  \'No?\' cried the King.  \'No, by the \nLord!\' said Leof.  Upon that the King rose from his seat, and, \nmaking passionately at the robber, and seizing him by his long \nhair, tried to throw him down.  But the robber had a dagger \nunderneath his cloak, and, in the scuffle, stabbed the King to \ndeath.  That done, he set his back against the wall, and fought so \ndesperately, that although he was soon cut to pieces by the King\'s \narmed men, and the wall and pavement were splashed with his blood, \nyet it was not before he had killed and wounded many of them.  You \nmay imagine what rough lives the kings of those times led, when one \nof them could struggle, half drunk, with a public robber in his own \ndining-hall, and be stabbed in presence of the company who ate and \ndrank with him.\n\nThen succeeded the boy-king EDRED, who was weak and sickly in body, \nbut of a strong mind.  And his armies fought the Northmen, the \nDanes, and Norwegians, or the Sea-Kings, as they were called, and \nbeat them for the time.  And, in nine years, Edred died, and passed \naway.\n\nThen came the boy-king EDWY, fifteen years of age; but the real \nking, who had the real power, was a monk named DUNSTAN - a clever \npriest, a little mad, and not a little proud and cruel.\n\nDunstan was then Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, whither the body of \nKing Edmund the Magnificent was carried, to be buried.  While yet a \nboy, he had got out of his bed one night (being then in a fever), \nand walked about Glastonbury Church when it was under repair; and, \nbecause he did not tumble off some scaffolds that were there, and \nbreak his neck, it was reported that he had been shown over the \nbuilding by an angel.  He had also made a harp that was said to \nplay of itself - which it very likely did, as AEolian Harps, which \nare played by the wind, and are understood now, always do.  For \nthese wonders he had been once denounced by his enemies, who were \njealous of his favour with the late King Athelstan, as a magician; \nand he had been waylaid, bound hand and foot, and thrown into a \nmarsh.  But he got out again, somehow, to cause a great deal of \ntrouble yet.\n\nThe priests of those days were, generally, the only scholars.  They \nwere learned in many things.  Having to make their own convents and \nmonasteries on uncultivated grounds that were granted to them by \nthe Crown, it was necessary that they should be good farmers and \ngood gardeners, or their lands would have been too poor to support \nthem.  For the decoration of the chapels where they prayed, and for \nthe comfort of the refectories where they ate and drank, it was \nnecessary that there should be good carpenters, good smiths, good \npainters, among them.  For their greater safety in sickness and \naccident, living alone by themselves in solitary places, it was \nnecessary that they should study the virtues of plants and herbs, \nand should know how to dress cuts, burns, scalds, and bruises, and \nhow to set broken limbs.  Accordingly, they taught themselves, and \none another, a great variety of useful arts; and became skilful in \nagriculture, medicine, surgery, and handicraft.  And when they \nwanted the aid of any little piece of machinery, which would be \nsimple enough now, but was marvellous then, to impose a trick upon \nthe poor peasants, they knew very well how to make it; and DID make \nit many a time and often, I have no doubt.\n\nDunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, was one of the most sagacious \nof these monks.  He was an ingenious smith, and worked at a forge \nin a little cell.  This cell was made too short to admit of his \nlying at full length when he went to sleep - as if THAT did any \ngood to anybody! - and he used to tell the most extraordinary lies \nabout demons and spirits, who, he said, came there to persecute \nhim.  For instance, he related that one day when he was at work, \nthe devil looked in at the little window, and tried to tempt him to \nlead a life of idle pleasure; whereupon, having his pincers in the \nfire, red hot, he seized the devil by the nose, and put him to such \npain, that his bellowings were heard for miles and miles.  Some \npeople are inclined to think this nonsense a part of Dunstan\'s \nmadness (for his head never quite recovered the fever), but I think \nnot.  I observe that it induced the ignorant people to consider him \na holy man, and that it made him very powerful.  Which was exactly \nwhat he always wanted.\n\nOn the day of the coronation of the handsome boy-king Edwy, it was \nremarked by ODO, Archbishop of Canterbury (who was a Dane by \nbirth), that the King quietly left the coronation feast, while all \nthe company were there.  Odo, much displeased, sent his friend \nDunstan to seek him.  Dunstan finding him in the company of his \nbeautiful young wife ELGIVA, and her mother ETHELGIVA, a good and \nvirtuous lady, not only grossly abused them, but dragged the young \nKing back into the feasting-hall by force.  Some, again, think \nDunstan did this because the young King\'s fair wife was his own \ncousin, and the monks objected to people marrying their own \ncousins; but I believe he did it, because he was an imperious, \naudacious, ill-conditioned priest, who, having loved a young lady \nhimself before he became a sour monk, hated all love now, and \neverything belonging to it.\n\nThe young King was quite old enough to feel this insult.  Dunstan \nhad been Treasurer in the last reign, and he soon charged Dunstan \nwith having taken some of the last king\'s money.  The Glastonbury \nAbbot fled to Belgium (very narrowly escaping some pursuers who \nwere sent to put out his eyes, as you will wish they had, when you \nread what follows), and his abbey was given to priests who were \nmarried; whom he always, both before and afterwards, opposed.  But \nhe quickly conspired with his friend, Odo the Dane, to set up the \nKing\'s young brother, EDGAR, as his rival for the throne; and, not \ncontent with this revenge, he caused the beautiful queen Elgiva, \nthough a lovely girl of only seventeen or eighteen, to be stolen \nfrom one of the Royal Palaces, branded in the cheek with a red-hot \niron, and sold into slavery in Ireland.  But the Irish people \npitied and befriended her; and they said, \'Let us restore the girl-\nqueen to the boy-king, and make the young lovers happy!\' and they \ncured her of her cruel wound, and sent her home as beautiful as \nbefore.  But the villain Dunstan, and that other villain, Odo, \ncaused her to be waylaid at Gloucester as she was joyfully hurrying \nto join her husband, and to be hacked and hewn with swords, and to \nbe barbarously maimed and lamed, and left to die.  When Edwy the \nFair (his people called him so, because he was so young and \nhandsome) heard of her dreadful fate, he died of a broken heart; \nand so the pitiful story of the poor young wife and husband ends!  \nAh!  Better to be two cottagers in these better times, than king \nand queen of England in those bad days, though never so fair!\n\nThen came the boy-king, EDGAR, called the Peaceful, fifteen years \nold.  Dunstan, being still the real king, drove all married priests \nout of the monasteries and abbeys, and replaced them by solitary \nmonks like himself, of the rigid order called the Benedictines.  He \nmade himself Archbishop of Canterbury, for his greater glory; and \nexercised such power over the neighbouring British princes, and so \ncollected them about the King, that once, when the King held his \ncourt at Chester, and went on the river Dee to visit the monastery \nof St. John, the eight oars of his boat were pulled (as the people \nused to delight in relating in stories and songs) by eight crowned \nkings, and steered by the King of England.  As Edgar was very \nobedient to Dunstan and the monks, they took great pains to \nrepresent him as the best of kings.  But he was really profligate, \ndebauched, and vicious.  He once forcibly carried off a young lady \nfrom the convent at Wilton; and Dunstan, pretending to be very much \nshocked, condemned him not to wear his crown upon his head for \nseven years - no great punishment, I dare say, as it can hardly \nhave been a more comfortable ornament to wear, than a stewpan \nwithout a handle.  His marriage with his second wife, ELFRIDA, is \none of the worst events of his reign.  Hearing of the beauty of \nthis lady, he despatched his favourite courtier, ATHELWOLD, to her \nfather\'s castle in Devonshire, to see if she were really as \ncharming as fame reported.  Now, she was so exceedingly beautiful \nthat Athelwold fell in love with her himself, and married her; but \nhe told the King that she was only rich - not handsome.  The King, \nsuspecting the truth when they came home, resolved to pay the \nnewly-married couple a visit; and, suddenly, told Athelwold to \nprepare for his immediate coming.  Athelwold, terrified, confessed \nto his young wife what he had said and done, and implored her to \ndisguise her beauty by some ugly dress or silly manner, that he \nmight be safe from the King\'s anger.  She promised that she would; \nbut she was a proud woman, who would far rather have been a queen \nthan the wife of a courtier.  She dressed herself in her best \ndress, and adorned herself with her richest jewels; and when the \nKing came, presently, he discovered the cheat.  So, he caused his \nfalse friend, Athelwold, to be murdered in a wood, and married his \nwidow, this bad Elfrida.  Six or seven years afterwards, he died; \nand was buried, as if he had been all that the monks said he was, \nin the abbey of Glastonbury, which he - or Dunstan for him - had \nmuch enriched.\n\nEngland, in one part of this reign, was so troubled by wolves, \nwhich, driven out of the open country, hid themselves in the \nmountains of Wales when they were not attacking travellers and \nanimals, that the tribute payable by the Welsh people was forgiven \nthem, on condition of their producing, every year, three hundred \nwolves\' heads.  And the Welshmen were so sharp upon the wolves, to \nsave their money, that in four years there was not a wolf left.\n\nThen came the boy-king, EDWARD, called the Martyr, from the manner \nof his death.  Elfrida had a son, named ETHELRED, for whom she \nclaimed the throne; but Dunstan did not choose to favour him, and \nhe made Edward king.  The boy was hunting, one day, down in \nDorsetshire, when he rode near to Corfe Castle, where Elfrida and \nEthelred lived.  Wishing to see them kindly, he rode away from his \nattendants and galloped to the castle gate, where he arrived at \ntwilight, and blew his hunting-horn.  \'You are welcome, dear King,\' \nsaid Elfrida, coming out, with her brightest smiles.  \'Pray you \ndismount and enter.\'  \'Not so, dear madam,\' said the King.  \'My \ncompany will miss me, and fear that I have met with some harm.  \nPlease you to give me a cup of wine, that I may drink here, in the \nsaddle, to you and to my little brother, and so ride away with the \ngood speed I have made in riding here.\'  Elfrida, going in to bring \nthe wine, whispered an armed servant, one of her attendants, who \nstole out of the darkening gateway, and crept round behind the \nKing\'s horse.  As the King raised the cup to his lips, saying, \n\'Health!\' to the wicked woman who was smiling on him, and to his \ninnocent brother whose hand she held in hers, and who was only ten \nyears old, this armed man made a spring and stabbed him in the \nback.  He dropped the cup and spurred his horse away; but, soon \nfainting with loss of blood, dropped from the saddle, and, in his \nfall, entangled one of his feet in the stirrup.  The frightened \nhorse dashed on; trailing his rider\'s curls upon the ground; \ndragging his smooth young face through ruts, and stones, and \nbriers, and fallen leaves, and mud; until the hunters, tracking the \nanimal\'s course by the King\'s blood, caught his bridle, and \nreleased the disfigured body.\n\nThen came the sixth and last of the boy-kings, ETHELRED, whom \nElfrida, when he cried out at the sight of his murdered brother \nriding away from the castle gate, unmercifully beat with a torch \nwhich she snatched from one of the attendants.  The people so \ndisliked this boy, on account of his cruel mother and the murder \nshe had done to promote him, that Dunstan would not have had him \nfor king, but would have made EDGITHA, the daughter of the dead \nKing Edgar, and of the lady whom he stole out of the convent at \nWilton, Queen of England, if she would have consented.  But she \nknew the stories of the youthful kings too well, and would not be \npersuaded from the convent where she lived in peace; so, Dunstan \nput Ethelred on the throne, having no one else to put there, and \ngave him the nickname of THE UNREADY - knowing that he wanted \nresolution and firmness.\n\nAt first, Elfrida possessed great influence over the young King, \nbut, as he grew older and came of age, her influence declined.  The \ninfamous woman, not having it in her power to do any more evil, \nthen retired from court, and, according, to the fashion of the \ntime, built churches and monasteries, to expiate her guilt.  As if \na church, with a steeple reaching to the very stars, would have \nbeen any sign of true repentance for the blood of the poor boy, \nwhose murdered form was trailed at his horse\'s heels!  As if she \ncould have buried her wickedness beneath the senseless stones of \nthe whole world, piled up one upon another, for the monks to live \nin!\n\nAbout the ninth or tenth year of this reign, Dunstan died.  He was \ngrowing old then, but was as stern and artful as ever.  Two \ncircumstances that happened in connexion with him, in this reign of \nEthelred, made a great noise.  Once, he was present at a meeting of \nthe Church, when the question was discussed whether priests should \nhave permission to marry; and, as he sat with his head hung down, \napparently thinking about it, a voice seemed to come out of a \ncrucifix in the room, and warn the meeting to be of his opinion.  \nThis was some juggling of Dunstan\'s, and was probably his own voice \ndisguised.  But he played off a worse juggle than that, soon \nafterwards; for, another meeting being held on the same subject, \nand he and his supporters being seated on one side of a great room, \nand their opponents on the other, he rose and said, \'To Christ \nhimself, as judge, do I commit this cause!\'  Immediately on these \nwords being spoken, the floor where the opposite party sat gave \nway, and some were killed and many wounded.  You may be pretty sure \nthat it had been weakened under Dunstan\'s direction, and that it \nfell at Dunstan\'s signal.  HIS part of the floor did not go down.  \nNo, no.  He was too good a workman for that.\n\nWhen he died, the monks settled that he was a Saint, and called him \nSaint Dunstan ever afterwards.  They might just as well have \nsettled that he was a coach-horse, and could just as easily have \ncalled him one.\n\nEthelred the Unready was glad enough, I dare say, to be rid of this \nholy saint; but, left to himself, he was a poor weak king, and his \nreign was a reign of defeat and shame.  The restless Danes, led by \nSWEYN, a son of the King of Denmark who had quarrelled with his \nfather and had been banished from home, again came into England, \nand, year after year, attacked and despoiled large towns.  To coax \nthese sea-kings away, the weak Ethelred paid them money; but, the \nmore money he paid, the more money the Danes wanted.  At first, he \ngave them ten thousand pounds; on their next invasion, sixteen \nthousand pounds; on their next invasion, four and twenty thousand \npounds:  to pay which large sums, the unfortunate English people \nwere heavily taxed.  But, as the Danes still came back and wanted \nmore, he thought it would be a good plan to marry into some \npowerful foreign family that would help him with soldiers.  So, in \nthe year one thousand and two, he courted and married Emma, the \nsister of Richard Duke of Normandy; a lady who was called the \nFlower of Normandy.\n\nAnd now, a terrible deed was done in England, the like of which was \nnever done on English ground before or since.  On the thirteenth of \nNovember, in pursuance of secret instructions sent by the King over \nthe whole country, the inhabitants of every town and city armed, \nand murdered all the Danes who were their neighbours.\n\nYoung and old, babies and soldiers, men and women, every Dane was \nkilled.  No doubt there were among them many ferocious men who had \ndone the English great wrong, and whose pride and insolence, in \nswaggering in the houses of the English and insulting their wives \nand daughters, had become unbearable; but no doubt there were also \namong them many peaceful Christian Danes who had married English \nwomen and become like English men.  They were all slain, even to \nGUNHILDA, the sister of the King of Denmark, married to an English \nlord; who was first obliged to see the murder of her husband and \nher child, and then was killed herself.\n\nWhen the King of the sea-kings heard of this deed of blood, he \nswore that he would have a great revenge.  He raised an army, and a \nmightier fleet of ships than ever yet had sailed to England; and in \nall his army there was not a slave or an old man, but every soldier \nwas a free man, and the son of a free man, and in the prime of \nlife, and sworn to be revenged upon the English nation, for the \nmassacre of that dread thirteenth of November, when his countrymen \nand countrywomen, and the little children whom they loved, were \nkilled with fire and sword.  And so, the sea-kings came to England \nin many great ships, each bearing the flag of its own commander.  \nGolden eagles, ravens, dragons, dolphins, beasts of prey, \nthreatened England from the prows of those ships, as they came \nonward through the water; and were reflected in the shining shields \nthat hung upon their sides.  The ship that bore the standard of the \nKing of the sea-kings was carved and painted like a mighty serpent; \nand the King in his anger prayed that the Gods in whom he trusted \nmight all desert him, if his serpent did not strike its fangs into \nEngland\'s heart.\n\nAnd indeed it did.  For, the great army landing from the great \nfleet, near Exeter, went forward, laying England waste, and \nstriking their lances in the earth as they advanced, or throwing \nthem into rivers, in token of their making all the island theirs.  \nIn remembrance of the black November night when the Danes were \nmurdered, wheresoever the invaders came, they made the Saxons \nprepare and spread for them great feasts; and when they had eaten \nthose feasts, and had drunk a curse to England with wild \nrejoicings, they drew their swords, and killed their Saxon \nentertainers, and marched on.  For six long years they carried on \nthis war:  burning the crops, farmhouses, barns, mills, granaries; \nkilling the labourers in the fields; preventing the seed from being \nsown in the ground; causing famine and starvation; leaving only \nheaps of ruin and smoking ashes, where they had found rich towns.  \nTo crown this misery, English officers and men deserted, and even \nthe favourites of Ethelred the Unready, becoming traitors, seized \nmany of the English ships, turned pirates against their own \ncountry, and aided by a storm occasioned the loss of nearly the \nwhole English navy.\n\nThere was but one man of note, at this miserable pass, who was true \nto his country and the feeble King.  He was a priest, and a brave \none.  For twenty days, the Archbishop of Canterbury defended that \ncity against its Danish besiegers; and when a traitor in the town \nthrew the gates open and admitted them, he said, in chains, \'I will \nnot buy my life with money that must be extorted from the suffering \npeople.  Do with me what you please!\'  Again and again, he steadily \nrefused to purchase his release with gold wrung from the poor.\n\nAt last, the Danes being tired of this, and being assembled at a \ndrunken merry-making, had him brought into the feasting-hall.\n\n\'Now, bishop,\' they said, \'we want gold!\'\n\nHe looked round on the crowd of angry faces; from the shaggy beards \nclose to him, to the shaggy beards against the walls, where men \nwere mounted on tables and forms to see him over the heads of \nothers:  and he knew that his time was come.\n\n\'I have no gold,\' he said.\n\n\'Get it, bishop!\' they all thundered.\n\n\'That, I have often told you I will not,\' said he.\n\nThey gathered closer round him, threatening, but he stood unmoved.  \nThen, one man struck him; then, another; then a cursing soldier \npicked up from a heap in a corner of the hall, where fragments had \nbeen rudely thrown at dinner, a great ox-bone, and cast it at his \nface, from which the blood came spurting forth; then, others ran to \nthe same heap, and knocked him down with other bones, and bruised \nand battered him; until one soldier whom he had baptised (willing, \nas I hope for the sake of that soldier\'s soul, to shorten the \nsufferings of the good man) struck him dead with his battle-axe.\n\nIf Ethelred had had the heart to emulate the courage of this noble \narchbishop, he might have done something yet.  But he paid the \nDanes forty-eight thousand pounds, instead, and gained so little by \nthe cowardly act, that Sweyn soon afterwards came over to subdue \nall England.  So broken was the attachment of the English people, \nby this time, to their incapable King and their forlorn country \nwhich could not protect them, that they welcomed Sweyn on all \nsides, as a deliverer.  London faithfully stood out, as long as the \nKing was within its walls; but, when he sneaked away, it also \nwelcomed the Dane.  Then, all was over; and the King took refuge \nabroad with the Duke of Normandy, who had already given shelter to \nthe King\'s wife, once the Flower of that country, and to her \nchildren.\n\nStill, the English people, in spite of their sad sufferings, could \nnot quite forget the great King Alfred and the Saxon race.  When \nSweyn died suddenly, in little more than a month after he had been \nproclaimed King of England, they generously sent to Ethelred, to \nsay that they would have him for their King again, \'if he would \nonly govern them better than he had governed them before.\'  The \nUnready, instead of coming himself, sent Edward, one of his sons, \nto make promises for him.  At last, he followed, and the English \ndeclared him King.  The Danes declared CANUTE, the son of Sweyn, \nKing.  Thus, direful war began again, and lasted for three years, \nwhen the Unready died.  And I know of nothing better that he did, \nin all his reign of eight and thirty years.\n\nWas Canute to be King now?  Not over the Saxons, they said; they \nmust have EDMUND, one of the sons of the Unready, who was surnamed \nIRONSIDE, because of his strength and stature.  Edmund and Canute \nthereupon fell to, and fought five battles - O unhappy England, \nwhat a fighting-ground it was! - and then Ironside, who was a big \nman, proposed to Canute, who was a little man, that they two should \nfight it out in single combat.  If Canute had been the big man, he \nwould probably have said yes, but, being the little man, he \ndecidedly said no.  However, he declared that he was willing to \ndivide the kingdom - to take all that lay north of Watling Street, \nas the old Roman military road from Dover to Chester was called, \nand to give Ironside all that lay south of it.  Most men being \nweary of so much bloodshed, this was done.  But Canute soon became \nsole King of England; for Ironside died suddenly within two months.  \nSome think that he was killed, and killed by Canute\'s orders.  No \none knows.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V - ENGLAND UNDER CANUTE THE DANE\n\n\n\nCANUTE reigned eighteen years.  He was a merciless King at first.  \nAfter he had clasped the hands of the Saxon chiefs, in token of the \nsincerity with which he swore to be just and good to them in return \nfor their acknowledging him, he denounced and slew many of them, as \nwell as many relations of the late King.  \'He who brings me the \nhead of one of my enemies,\' he used to say, \'shall be dearer to me \nthan a brother.\'  And he was so severe in hunting down his enemies, \nthat he must have got together a pretty large family of these dear \nbrothers.  He was strongly inclined to kill EDMUND and EDWARD, two \nchildren, sons of poor Ironside; but, being afraid to do so in \nEngland, he sent them over to the King of Sweden, with a request \nthat the King would be so good as \'dispose of them.\'  If the King \nof Sweden had been like many, many other men of that day, he would \nhave had their innocent throats cut; but he was a kind man, and \nbrought them up tenderly.\n\nNormandy ran much in Canute\'s mind.  In Normandy were the two \nchildren of the late king - EDWARD and ALFRED by name; and their \nuncle the Duke might one day claim the crown for them.  But the \nDuke showed so little inclination to do so now, that he proposed to \nCanute to marry his sister, the widow of The Unready; who, being \nbut a showy flower, and caring for nothing so much as becoming a \nqueen again, left her children and was wedded to him.\n\nSuccessful and triumphant, assisted by the valour of the English in \nhis foreign wars, and with little strife to trouble him at home, \nCanute had a prosperous reign, and made many improvements.  He was \na poet and a musician.  He grew sorry, as he grew older, for the \nblood he had shed at first; and went to Rome in a Pilgrim\'s dress, \nby way of washing it out.  He gave a great deal of money to \nforeigners on his journey; but he took it from the English before \nhe started.  On the whole, however, he certainly became a far \nbetter man when he had no opposition to contend with, and was as \ngreat a King as England had known for some time.\n\nThe old writers of history relate how that Canute was one day \ndisgusted with his courtiers for their flattery, and how he caused \nhis chair to be set on the sea-shore, and feigned to command the \ntide as it came up not to wet the edge of his robe, for the land \nwas his; how the tide came up, of course, without regarding him; \nand how he then turned to his flatterers, and rebuked them, saying, \nwhat was the might of any earthly king, to the might of the \nCreator, who could say unto the sea, \'Thus far shalt thou go, and \nno farther!\'  We may learn from this, I think, that a little sense \nwill go a long way in a king; and that courtiers are not easily \ncured of flattery, nor kings of a liking for it.  If the courtiers \nof Canute had not known, long before, that the King was fond of \nflattery, they would have known better than to offer it in such \nlarge doses.  And if they had not known that he was vain of this \nspeech (anything but a wonderful speech it seems to me, if a good \nchild had made it), they would not have been at such great pains to \nrepeat it.  I fancy I see them all on the sea-shore together; the \nKing\'s chair sinking in the sand; the King in a mighty good humour \nwith his own wisdom; and the courtiers pretending to be quite \nstunned by it!\n\nIt is not the sea alone that is bidden to go \'thus far, and no \nfarther.\'  The great command goes forth to all the kings upon the \nearth, and went to Canute in the year one thousand and thirty-five, \nand stretched him dead upon his bed.  Beside it, stood his Norman \nwife.  Perhaps, as the King looked his last upon her, he, who had \nso often thought distrustfully of Normandy, long ago, thought once \nmore of the two exiled Princes in their uncle\'s court, and of the \nlittle favour they could feel for either Danes or Saxons, and of a \nrising cloud in Normandy that slowly moved towards England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI - ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD HAREFOOT, HARDICANUTE, AND EDWARD \nTHE CONFESSOR\n\n\n\nCANUTE left three sons, by name SWEYN, HAROLD, and HARDICANUTE; but \nhis Queen, Emma, once the Flower of Normandy, was the mother of \nonly Hardicanute.  Canute had wished his dominions to be divided \nbetween the three, and had wished Harold to have England; but the \nSaxon people in the South of England, headed by a nobleman with \ngreat possessions, called the powerful EARL GODWIN (who is said to \nhave been originally a poor cow-boy), opposed this, and desired to \nhave, instead, either Hardicanute, or one of the two exiled Princes \nwho were over in Normandy.  It seemed so certain that there would \nbe more bloodshed to settle this dispute, that many people left \ntheir homes, and took refuge in the woods and swamps.  Happily, \nhowever, it was agreed to refer the whole question to a great \nmeeting at Oxford, which decided that Harold should have all the \ncountry north of the Thames, with London for his capital city, and \nthat Hardicanute should have all the south.  The quarrel was so \narranged; and, as Hardicanute was in Denmark troubling himself very \nlittle about anything but eating and getting drunk, his mother and \nEarl Godwin governed the south for him.\n\nThey had hardly begun to do so, and the trembling people who had \nhidden themselves were scarcely at home again, when Edward, the \nelder of the two exiled Princes, came over from Normandy with a few \nfollowers, to claim the English Crown.  His mother Emma, however, \nwho only cared for her last son Hardicanute, instead of assisting \nhim, as he expected, opposed him so strongly with all her influence \nthat he was very soon glad to get safely back.  His brother Alfred \nwas not so fortunate.  Believing in an affectionate letter, written \nsome time afterwards to him and his brother, in his mother\'s name \n(but whether really with or without his mother\'s knowledge is now \nuncertain), he allowed himself to be tempted over to England, with \na good force of soldiers, and landing on the Kentish coast, and \nbeing met and welcomed by Earl Godwin, proceeded into Surrey, as \nfar as the town of Guildford.  Here, he and his men halted in the \nevening to rest, having still the Earl in their company; who had \nordered lodgings and good cheer for them.  But, in the dead of the \nnight, when they were off their guard, being divided into small \nparties sleeping soundly after a long march and a plentiful supper \nin different houses, they were set upon by the King\'s troops, and \ntaken prisoners.  Next morning they were drawn out in a line, to \nthe number of six hundred men, and were barbarously tortured and \nkilled; with the exception of every tenth man, who was sold into \nslavery.  As to the wretched Prince Alfred, he was stripped naked, \ntied to a horse and sent away into the Isle of Ely, where his eyes \nwere torn out of his head, and where in a few days he miserably \ndied.  I am not sure that the Earl had wilfully entrapped him, but \nI suspect it strongly.\n\nHarold was now King all over England, though it is doubtful whether \nthe Archbishop of Canterbury (the greater part of the priests were \nSaxons, and not friendly to the Danes) ever consented to crown him.  \nCrowned or uncrowned, with the Archbishop\'s leave or without it, he \nwas King for four years:  after which short reign he died, and was \nburied; having never done much in life but go a hunting.  He was \nsuch a fast runner at this, his favourite sport, that the people \ncalled him Harold Harefoot.\n\nHardicanute was then at Bruges, in Flanders, plotting, with his \nmother (who had gone over there after the cruel murder of Prince \nAlfred), for the invasion of England.  The Danes and Saxons, \nfinding themselves without a King, and dreading new disputes, made \ncommon cause, and joined in inviting him to occupy the Throne.  He \nconsented, and soon troubled them enough; for he brought over \nnumbers of Danes, and taxed the people so insupportably to enrich \nthose greedy favourites that there were many insurrections, \nespecially one at Worcester, where the citizens rose and killed his \ntax-collectors; in revenge for which he burned their city.  He was \na brutal King, whose first public act was to order the dead body of \npoor Harold Harefoot to be dug up, beheaded, and thrown into the \nriver.  His end was worthy of such a beginning.  He fell down \ndrunk, with a goblet of wine in his hand, at a wedding-feast at \nLambeth, given in honour of the marriage of his standard-bearer, a \nDane named TOWED THE PROUD.  And he never spoke again.\n\nEDWARD, afterwards called by the monks THE CONFESSOR, succeeded; \nand his first act was to oblige his mother Emma, who had favoured \nhim so little, to retire into the country; where she died some ten \nyears afterwards.  He was the exiled prince whose brother Alfred \nhad been so foully killed.  He had been invited over from Normandy \nby Hardicanute, in the course of his short reign of two years, and \nhad been handsomely treated at court.  His cause was now favoured \nby the powerful Earl Godwin, and he was soon made King.  This Earl \nhad been suspected by the people, ever since Prince Alfred\'s cruel \ndeath; he had even been tried in the last reign for the Prince\'s \nmurder, but had been pronounced not guilty; chiefly, as it was \nsupposed, because of a present he had made to the swinish King, of \na gilded ship with a figure-head of solid gold, and a crew of \neighty splendidly armed men.  It was his interest to help the new \nKing with his power, if the new King would help him against the \npopular distrust and hatred.  So they made a bargain.  Edward the \nConfessor got the Throne.  The Earl got more power and more land, \nand his daughter Editha was made queen; for it was a part of their \ncompact that the King should take her for his wife.\n\nBut, although she was a gentle lady, in all things worthy to be \nbeloved - good, beautiful, sensible, and kind - the King from the \nfirst neglected her.  Her father and her six proud brothers, \nresenting this cold treatment, harassed the King greatly by \nexerting all their power to make him unpopular.  Having lived so \nlong in Normandy, he preferred the Normans to the English.  He made \na Norman Archbishop, and Norman Bishops; his great officers and \nfavourites were all Normans; he introduced the Norman fashions and \nthe Norman language; in imitation of the state custom of Normandy, \nhe attached a great seal to his state documents, instead of merely \nmarking them, as the Saxon Kings had done, with the sign of the \ncross - just as poor people who have never been taught to write, \nnow make the same mark for their names.  All this, the powerful \nEarl Godwin and his six proud sons represented to the people as \ndisfavour shown towards the English; and thus they daily increased \ntheir own power, and daily diminished the power of the King.\n\nThey were greatly helped by an event that occurred when he had \nreigned eight years.  Eustace, Earl of Bologne, who had married the \nKing\'s sister, came to England on a visit.  After staying at the \ncourt some time, he set forth, with his numerous train of \nattendants, to return home.  They were to embark at Dover.  \nEntering that peaceful town in armour, they took possession of the \nbest houses, and noisily demanded to be lodged and entertained \nwithout payment.  One of the bold men of Dover, who would not \nendure to have these domineering strangers jingling their heavy \nswords and iron corselets up and down his house, eating his meat \nand drinking his strong liquor, stood in his doorway and refused \nadmission to the first armed man who came there.  The armed man \ndrew, and wounded him.  The man of Dover struck the armed man dead.  \nIntelligence of what he had done, spreading through the streets to \nwhere the Count Eustace and his men were standing by their horses, \nbridle in hand, they passionately mounted, galloped to the house, \nsurrounded it, forced their way in (the doors and windows being \nclosed when they came up), and killed the man of Dover at his own \nfireside.  They then clattered through the streets, cutting down \nand riding over men, women, and children.  This did not last long, \nyou may believe.  The men of Dover set upon them with great fury, \nkilled nineteen of the foreigners, wounded many more, and, \nblockading the road to the port so that they should not embark, \nbeat them out of the town by the way they had come.  Hereupon, \nCount Eustace rides as hard as man can ride to Gloucester, where \nEdward is, surrounded by Norman monks and Norman lords.  \'Justice!\' \ncries the Count, \'upon the men of Dover, who have set upon and \nslain my people!\'  The King sends immediately for the powerful Earl \nGodwin, who happens to be near; reminds him that Dover is under his \ngovernment; and orders him to repair to Dover and do military \nexecution on the inhabitants.  \'It does not become you,\' says the \nproud Earl in reply, \'to condemn without a hearing those whom you \nhave sworn to protect.  I will not do it.\'\n\nThe King, therefore, summoned the Earl, on pain of banishment and \nloss of his titles and property, to appear before the court to \nanswer this disobedience.  The Earl refused to appear.  He, his \neldest son Harold, and his second son Sweyn, hastily raised as many \nfighting men as their utmost power could collect, and demanded to \nhave Count Eustace and his followers surrendered to the justice of \nthe country.  The King, in his turn, refused to give them up, and \nraised a strong force.  After some treaty and delay, the troops of \nthe great Earl and his sons began to fall off.  The Earl, with a \npart of his family and abundance of treasure, sailed to Flanders; \nHarold escaped to Ireland; and the power of the great family was \nfor that time gone in England.  But, the people did not forget \nthem.\n\nThen, Edward the Confessor, with the true meanness of a mean \nspirit, visited his dislike of the once powerful father and sons \nupon the helpless daughter and sister, his unoffending wife, whom \nall who saw her (her husband and his monks excepted) loved.  He \nseized rapaciously upon her fortune and her jewels, and allowing \nher only one attendant, confined her in a gloomy convent, of which \na sister of his - no doubt an unpleasant lady after his own heart - \nwas abbess or jailer.\n\nHaving got Earl Godwin and his six sons well out of his way, the \nKing favoured the Normans more than ever.  He invited over WILLIAM, \nDUKE OF NORMANDY, the son of that Duke who had received him and his \nmurdered brother long ago, and of a peasant girl, a tanner\'s \ndaughter, with whom that Duke had fallen in love for her beauty as \nhe saw her washing clothes in a brook.  William, who was a great \nwarrior, with a passion for fine horses, dogs, and arms, accepted \nthe invitation; and the Normans in England, finding themselves more \nnumerous than ever when he arrived with his retinue, and held in \nstill greater honour at court than before, became more and more \nhaughty towards the people, and were more and more disliked by \nthem.\n\nThe old Earl Godwin, though he was abroad, knew well how the people \nfelt; for, with part of the treasure he had carried away with him, \nhe kept spies and agents in his pay all over England.\n\nAccordingly, he thought the time was come for fitting out a great \nexpedition against the Norman-loving King.  With it, he sailed to \nthe Isle of Wight, where he was joined by his son Harold, the most \ngallant and brave of all his family.  And so the father and son \ncame sailing up the Thames to Southwark; great numbers of the \npeople declaring for them, and shouting for the English Earl and \nthe English Harold, against the Norman favourites!\n\nThe King was at first as blind and stubborn as kings usually have \nbeen whensoever they have been in the hands of monks.  But the \npeople rallied so thickly round the old Earl and his son, and the \nold Earl was so steady in demanding without bloodshed the \nrestoration of himself and his family to their rights, that at last \nthe court took the alarm.  The Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, and \nthe Norman Bishop of London, surrounded by their retainers, fought \ntheir way out of London, and escaped from Essex to France in a \nfishing-boat.  The other Norman favourites dispersed in all \ndirections.  The old Earl and his sons (except Sweyn, who had \ncommitted crimes against the law) were restored to their \npossessions and dignities.  Editha, the virtuous and lovely Queen \nof the insensible King, was triumphantly released from her prison, \nthe convent, and once more sat in her chair of state, arrayed in \nthe jewels of which, when she had no champion to support her \nrights, her cold-blooded husband had deprived her.\n\nThe old Earl Godwin did not long enjoy his restored fortune.  He \nfell down in a fit at the King\'s table, and died upon the third day \nafterwards.  Harold succeeded to his power, and to a far higher \nplace in the attachment of the people than his father had ever \nheld.  By his valour he subdued the King\'s enemies in many bloody \nfights.  He was vigorous against rebels in Scotland - this was the \ntime when Macbeth slew Duncan, upon which event our English \nShakespeare, hundreds of years afterwards, wrote his great tragedy; \nand he killed the restless Welsh King GRIFFITH, and brought his \nhead to England.\n\nWhat Harold was doing at sea, when he was driven on the French \ncoast by a tempest, is not at all certain; nor does it at all \nmatter.  That his ship was forced by a storm on that shore, and \nthat he was taken prisoner, there is no doubt.  In those barbarous \ndays, all shipwrecked strangers were taken prisoners, and obliged \nto pay ransom.  So, a certain Count Guy, who was the Lord of \nPonthieu where Harold\'s disaster happened, seized him, instead of \nrelieving him like a hospitable and Christian lord as he ought to \nhave done, and expected to make a very good thing of it.\n\nBut Harold sent off immediately to Duke William of Normandy, \ncomplaining of this treatment; and the Duke no sooner heard of it \nthan he ordered Harold to be escorted to the ancient town of Rouen, \nwhere he then was, and where he received him as an honoured guest.  \nNow, some writers tell us that Edward the Confessor, who was by \nthis time old and had no children, had made a will, appointing Duke \nWilliam of Normandy his successor, and had informed the Duke of his \nhaving done so.  There is no doubt that he was anxious about his \nsuccessor; because he had even invited over, from abroad, EDWARD \nTHE OUTLAW, a son of Ironside, who had come to England with his \nwife and three children, but whom the King had strangely refused to \nsee when he did come, and who had died in London suddenly (princes \nwere terribly liable to sudden death in those days), and had been \nburied in St. Paul\'s Cathedral.  The King might possibly have made \nsuch a will; or, having always been fond of the Normans, he might \nhave encouraged Norman William to aspire to the English crown, by \nsomething that he said to him when he was staying at the English \ncourt.  But, certainly William did now aspire to it; and knowing \nthat Harold would be a powerful rival, he called together a great \nassembly of his nobles, offered Harold his daughter ADELE in \nmarriage, informed him that he meant on King Edward\'s death to \nclaim the English crown as his own inheritance, and required Harold \nthen and there to swear to aid him.  Harold, being in the Duke\'s \npower, took this oath upon the Missal, or Prayer-book.  It is a \ngood example of the superstitions of the monks, that this Missal, \ninstead of being placed upon a table, was placed upon a tub; which, \nwhen Harold had sworn, was uncovered, and shown to be full of dead \nmen\'s bones - bones, as the monks pretended, of saints.  This was \nsupposed to make Harold\'s oath a great deal more impressive and \nbinding.  As if the great name of the Creator of Heaven and earth \ncould be made more solemn by a knuckle-bone, or a double-tooth, or \na finger-nail, of Dunstan!\n\nWithin a week or two after Harold\'s return to England, the dreary \nold Confessor was found to be dying.  After wandering in his mind \nlike a very weak old man, he died.  As he had put himself entirely \nin the hands of the monks when he was alive, they praised him \nlustily when he was dead.  They had gone so far, already, as to \npersuade him that he could work miracles; and had brought people \nafflicted with a bad disorder of the skin, to him, to be touched \nand cured.  This was called \'touching for the King\'s Evil,\' which \nafterwards became a royal custom.  You know, however, Who really \ntouched the sick, and healed them; and you know His sacred name is \nnot among the dusty line of human kings.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII - ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD THE SECOND, AND CONQUERED BY THE \nNORMANS\n\n\n\nHAROLD was crowned King of England on the very day of the maudlin \nConfessor\'s funeral.  He had good need to be quick about it.  When \nthe news reached Norman William, hunting in his park at Rouen, he \ndropped his bow, returned to his palace, called his nobles to \ncouncil, and presently sent ambassadors to Harold, calling on him \nto keep his oath and resign the Crown.  Harold would do no such \nthing.  The barons of France leagued together round Duke William \nfor the invasion of England.  Duke William promised freely to \ndistribute English wealth and English lands among them.  The Pope \nsent to Normandy a consecrated banner, and a ring containing a hair \nwhich he warranted to have grown on the head of Saint Peter.  He \nblessed the enterprise; and cursed Harold; and requested that the \nNormans would pay \'Peter\'s Pence\' - or a tax to himself of a penny \na year on every house - a little more regularly in future, if they \ncould make it convenient.\n\nKing Harold had a rebel brother in Flanders, who was a vassal of \nHAROLD HARDRADA, King of Norway.  This brother, and this Norwegian \nKing, joining their forces against England, with Duke William\'s \nhelp, won a fight in which the English were commanded by two \nnobles; and then besieged York.  Harold, who was waiting for the \nNormans on the coast at Hastings, with his army, marched to \nStamford Bridge upon the river Derwent to give them instant battle.\n\nHe found them drawn up in a hollow circle, marked out by their \nshining spears.  Riding round this circle at a distance, to survey \nit, he saw a brave figure on horseback, in a blue mantle and a \nbright helmet, whose horse suddenly stumbled and threw him.\n\n\'Who is that man who has fallen?\' Harold asked of one of his \ncaptains.\n\n\'The King of Norway,\' he replied.\n\n\'He is a tall and stately king,\' said Harold, \'but his end is \nnear.\'\n\nHe added, in a little while, \'Go yonder to my brother, and tell \nhim, if he withdraw his troops, he shall be Earl of Northumberland, \nand rich and powerful in England.\'\n\nThe captain rode away and gave the message.\n\n\'What will he give to my friend the King of Norway?\' asked the \nbrother.\n\n\'Seven feet of earth for a grave,\' replied the captain.\n\n\'No more?\' returned the brother, with a smile.\n\n\'The King of Norway being a tall man, perhaps a little more,\' \nreplied the captain.\n\n\'Ride back!\' said the brother, \'and tell King Harold to make ready \nfor the fight!\'\n\nHe did so, very soon.  And such a fight King Harold led against \nthat force, that his brother, and the Norwegian King, and every \nchief of note in all their host, except the Norwegian King\'s son, \nOlave, to whom he gave honourable dismissal, were left dead upon \nthe field.  The victorious army marched to York.  As King Harold \nsat there at the feast, in the midst of all his company, a stir was \nheard at the doors; and messengers all covered with mire from \nriding far and fast through broken ground came hurrying in, to \nreport that the Normans had landed in England.\n\nThe intelligence was true.  They had been tossed about by contrary \nwinds, and some of their ships had been wrecked.  A part of their \nown shore, to which they had been driven back, was strewn with \nNorman bodies.  But they had once more made sail, led by the Duke\'s \nown galley, a present from his wife, upon the prow whereof the \nfigure of a golden boy stood pointing towards England.  By day, the \nbanner of the three Lions of Normandy, the diverse coloured sails, \nthe gilded vans, the many decorations of this gorgeous ship, had \nglittered in the sun and sunny water; by night, a light had \nsparkled like a star at her mast-head.  And now, encamped near \nHastings, with their leader lying in the old Roman castle of \nPevensey, the English retiring in all directions, the land for \nmiles around scorched and smoking, fired and pillaged, was the \nwhole Norman power, hopeful and strong on English ground.\n\nHarold broke up the feast and hurried to London.  Within a week, \nhis army was ready.  He sent out spies to ascertain the Norman \nstrength.  William took them, caused them to be led through his \nwhole camp, and then dismissed.  \'The Normans,\' said these spies to \nHarold, \'are not bearded on the upper lip as we English are, but \nare shorn.  They are priests.\'  \'My men,\' replied Harold, with a \nlaugh, \'will find those priests good soldiers!\'\n\n\'The Saxons,\' reported Duke William\'s outposts of Norman soldiers, \nwho were instructed to retire as King Harold\'s army advanced, \'rush \non us through their pillaged country with the fury of madmen.\'\n\n\'Let them come, and come soon!\' said Duke William.\n\nSome proposals for a reconciliation were made, but were soon \nabandoned.  In the middle of the month of October, in the year one \nthousand and sixty-six, the Normans and the English came front to \nfront.  All night the armies lay encamped before each other, in a \npart of the country then called Senlac, now called (in remembrance \nof them) Battle.  With the first dawn of day, they arose.  There, \nin the faint light, were the English on a hill; a wood behind them; \nin their midst, the Royal banner, representing a fighting warrior, \nwoven in gold thread, adorned with precious stones; beneath the \nbanner, as it rustled in the wind, stood King Harold on foot, with \ntwo of his remaining brothers by his side; around them, still and \nsilent as the dead, clustered the whole English army - every \nsoldier covered by his shield, and bearing in his hand his dreaded \nEnglish battle-axe.\n\nOn an opposite hill, in three lines, archers, foot-soldiers, \nhorsemen, was the Norman force.  Of a sudden, a great battle-cry, \n\'God help us!\' burst from the Norman lines.  The English answered \nwith their own battle-cry, \'God\'s Rood!  Holy Rood!\'  The Normans \nthen came sweeping down the hill to attack the English.\n\nThere was one tall Norman Knight who rode before the Norman army on \na prancing horse, throwing up his heavy sword and catching it, and \nsinging of the bravery of his countrymen.  An English Knight, who \nrode out from the English force to meet him, fell by this Knight\'s \nhand.  Another English Knight rode out, and he fell too.  But then \na third rode out, and killed the Norman.  This was in the first \nbeginning of the fight.  It soon raged everywhere.\n\nThe English, keeping side by side in a great mass, cared no more \nfor the showers of Norman arrows than if they had been showers of \nNorman rain.  When the Norman horsemen rode against them, with \ntheir battle-axes they cut men and horses down.  The Normans gave \nway.  The English pressed forward.  A cry went forth among the \nNorman troops that Duke William was killed.  Duke William took off \nhis helmet, in order that his face might be distinctly seen, and \nrode along the line before his men.  This gave them courage.  As \nthey turned again to face the English, some of their Norman horse \ndivided the pursuing body of the English from the rest, and thus \nall that foremost portion of the English army fell, fighting \nbravely.  The main body still remaining firm, heedless of the \nNorman arrows, and with their battle-axes cutting down the crowds \nof horsemen when they rode up, like forests of young trees, Duke \nWilliam pretended to retreat.  The eager English followed.  The \nNorman army closed again, and fell upon them with great slaughter.\n\n\'Still,\' said Duke William, \'there are thousands of the English, \nfirms as rocks around their King.  Shoot upward, Norman archers, \nthat your arrows may fall down upon their faces!\'\n\nThe sun rose high, and sank, and the battle still raged.  Through \nall the wild October day, the clash and din resounded in the air.  \nIn the red sunset, and in the white moonlight, heaps upon heaps of \ndead men lay strewn, a dreadful spectacle, all over the ground.\n\nKing Harold, wounded with an arrow in the eye, was nearly blind.  \nHis brothers were already killed.  Twenty Norman Knights, whose \nbattered armour had flashed fiery and golden in the sunshine all \nday long, and now looked silvery in the moonlight, dashed forward \nto seize the Royal banner from the English Knights and soldiers, \nstill faithfully collected round their blinded King.  The King \nreceived a mortal wound, and dropped.  The English broke and fled.  \nThe Normans rallied, and the day was lost.\n\nO what a sight beneath the moon and stars, when lights were shining \nin the tent of the victorious Duke William, which was pitched near \nthe spot where Harold fell - and he and his knights were carousing, \nwithin - and soldiers with torches, going slowly to and fro, \nwithout, sought for the corpse of Harold among piles of dead - and \nthe Warrior, worked in golden thread and precious stones, lay low, \nall torn and soiled with blood - and the three Norman Lions kept \nwatch over the field!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII - ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE FIRST, THE NORMAN \nCONQUEROR\n\n\n\nUPON the ground where the brave Harold fell, William the Norman \nafterwards founded an abbey, which, under the name of Battle Abbey, \nwas a rich and splendid place through many a troubled year, though \nnow it is a grey ruin overgrown with ivy.  But the first work he \nhad to do, was to conquer the English thoroughly; and that, as you \nknow by this time, was hard work for any man.\n\nHe ravaged several counties; he burned and plundered many towns; he \nlaid waste scores upon scores of miles of pleasant country; he \ndestroyed innumerable lives.  At length STIGAND, Archbishop of \nCanterbury, with other representatives of the clergy and the \npeople, went to his camp, and submitted to him.  EDGAR, the \ninsignificant son of Edmund Ironside, was proclaimed King by \nothers, but nothing came of it.  He fled to Scotland afterwards, \nwhere his sister, who was young and beautiful, married the Scottish \nKing.  Edgar himself was not important enough for anybody to care \nmuch about him.\n\nOn Christmas Day, William was crowned in Westminster Abbey, under \nthe title of WILLIAM THE FIRST; but he is best known as WILLIAM THE \nCONQUEROR.  It was a strange coronation.  One of the bishops who \nperformed the ceremony asked the Normans, in French, if they would \nhave Duke William for their king?  They answered Yes.  Another of \nthe bishops put the same question to the Saxons, in English.  They \ntoo answered Yes, with a loud shout.  The noise being heard by a \nguard of Norman horse-soldiers outside, was mistaken for resistance \non the part of the English.  The guard instantly set fire to the \nneighbouring houses, and a tumult ensued; in the midst of which the \nKing, being left alone in the Abbey, with a few priests (and they \nall being in a terrible fright together), was hurriedly crowned.  \nWhen the crown was placed upon his head, he swore to govern the \nEnglish as well as the best of their own monarchs.  I dare say you \nthink, as I do, that if we except the Great Alfred, he might pretty \neasily have done that.\n\nNumbers of the English nobles had been killed in the last \ndisastrous battle.  Their estates, and the estates of all the \nnobles who had fought against him there, King William seized upon, \nand gave to his own Norman knights and nobles.  Many great English \nfamilies of the present time acquired their English lands in this \nway, and are very proud of it.\n\nBut what is got by force must be maintained by force.  These nobles \nwere obliged to build castles all over England, to defend their new \nproperty; and, do what he would, the King could neither soothe nor \nquell the nation as he wished.  He gradually introduced the Norman \nlanguage and the Norman customs; yet, for a long time the great \nbody of the English remained sullen and revengeful.  On his going \nover to Normandy, to visit his subjects there, the oppressions of \nhis half-brother ODO, whom he left in charge of his English \nkingdom, drove the people mad.  The men of Kent even invited over, \nto take possession of Dover, their old enemy Count Eustace of \nBoulogne, who had led the fray when the Dover man was slain at his \nown fireside.  The men of Hereford, aided by the Welsh, and \ncommanded by a chief named EDRIC THE WILD, drove the Normans out of \ntheir country.  Some of those who had been dispossessed of their \nlands, banded together in the North of England; some, in Scotland; \nsome, in the thick woods and marshes; and whensoever they could \nfall upon the Normans, or upon the English who had submitted to the \nNormans, they fought, despoiled, and murdered, like the desperate \noutlaws that they were.  Conspiracies were set on foot for a \ngeneral massacre of the Normans, like the old massacre of the \nDanes.  In short, the English were in a murderous mood all through \nthe kingdom.\n\nKing William, fearing he might lose his conquest, came back, and \ntried to pacify the London people by soft words.  He then set forth \nto repress the country people by stern deeds.  Among the towns \nwhich he besieged, and where he killed and maimed the inhabitants \nwithout any distinction, sparing none, young or old, armed or \nunarmed, were Oxford, Warwick, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, \nLincoln, York.  In all these places, and in many others, fire and \nsword worked their utmost horrors, and made the land dreadful to \nbehold.  The streams and rivers were discoloured with blood; the \nsky was blackened with smoke; the fields were wastes of ashes; the \nwaysides were heaped up with dead.  Such are the fatal results of \nconquest and ambition!  Although William was a harsh and angry man, \nI do not suppose that he deliberately meant to work this shocking \nruin, when he invaded England.  But what he had got by the strong \nhand, he could only keep by the strong hand, and in so doing he \nmade England a great grave.\n\nTwo sons of Harold, by name EDMUND and GODWIN, came over from \nIreland, with some ships, against the Normans, but were defeated.  \nThis was scarcely done, when the outlaws in the woods so harassed \nYork, that the Governor sent to the King for help.  The King \ndespatched a general and a large force to occupy the town of \nDurham.  The Bishop of that place met the general outside the town, \nand warned him not to enter, as he would be in danger there.  The \ngeneral cared nothing for the warning, and went in with all his \nmen.  That night, on every hill within sight of Durham, signal \nfires were seen to blaze.  When the morning dawned, the English, \nwho had assembled in great strength, forced the gates, rushed into \nthe town, and slew the Normans every one.  The English afterwards \nbesought the Danes to come and help them.  The Danes came, with two \nhundred and forty ships.  The outlawed nobles joined them; they \ncaptured York, and drove the Normans out of that city.  Then, \nWilliam bribed the Danes to go away; and took such vengeance on the \nEnglish, that all the former fire and sword, smoke and ashes, death \nand ruin, were nothing compared with it.  In melancholy songs, and \ndoleful stories, it was still sung and told by cottage fires on \nwinter evenings, a hundred years afterwards, how, in those dreadful \ndays of the Normans, there was not, from the River Humber to the \nRiver Tyne, one inhabited village left, nor one cultivated field - \nhow there was nothing but a dismal ruin, where the human creatures \nand the beasts lay dead together.\n\nThe outlaws had, at this time, what they called a Camp of Refuge, \nin the midst of the fens of Cambridgeshire.  Protected by those \nmarshy grounds which were difficult of approach, they lay among the \nreeds and rushes, and were hidden by the mists that rose up from \nthe watery earth.  Now, there also was, at that time, over the sea \nin Flanders, an Englishman named HEREWARD, whose father had died in \nhis absence, and whose property had been given to a Norman.  When \nhe heard of this wrong that had been done him (from such of the \nexiled English as chanced to wander into that country), he longed \nfor revenge; and joining the outlaws in their camp of refuge, \nbecame their commander.  He was so good a soldier, that the Normans \nsupposed him to be aided by enchantment.  William, even after he \nhad made a road three miles in length across the Cambridgeshire \nmarshes, on purpose to attack this supposed enchanter, thought it \nnecessary to engage an old lady, who pretended to be a sorceress, \nto come and do a little enchantment in the royal cause.  For this \npurpose she was pushed on before the troops in a wooden tower; but \nHereward very soon disposed of this unfortunate sorceress, by \nburning her, tower and all.  The monks of the convent of Ely near \nat hand, however, who were fond of good living, and who found it \nvery uncomfortable to have the country blockaded and their supplies \nof meat and drink cut off, showed the King a secret way of \nsurprising the camp.  So Hereward was soon defeated.  Whether he \nafterwards died quietly, or whether he was killed after killing \nsixteen of the men who attacked him (as some old rhymes relate that \nhe did), I cannot say.  His defeat put an end to the Camp of \nRefuge; and, very soon afterwards, the King, victorious both in \nScotland and in England, quelled the last rebellious English noble.  \nHe then surrounded himself with Norman lords, enriched by the \nproperty of English nobles; had a great survey made of all the land \nin England, which was entered as the property of its new owners, on \na roll called Doomsday Book; obliged the people to put out their \nfires and candles at a certain hour every night, on the ringing of \na bell which was called The Curfew; introduced the Norman dresses \nand manners; made the Normans masters everywhere, and the English, \nservants; turned out the English bishops, and put Normans in their \nplaces; and showed himself to be the Conqueror indeed.\n\nBut, even with his own Normans, he had a restless life.  They were \nalways hungering and thirsting for the riches of the English; and \nthe more he gave, the more they wanted.  His priests were as greedy \nas his soldiers.  We know of only one Norman who plainly told his \nmaster, the King, that he had come with him to England to do his \nduty as a faithful servant, and that property taken by force from \nother men had no charms for him.  His name was GUILBERT.  We should \nnot forget his name, for it is good to remember and to honour \nhonest men.\n\nBesides all these troubles, William the Conqueror was troubled by \nquarrels among his sons.  He had three living.  ROBERT, called \nCURTHOSE, because of his short legs; WILLIAM, called RUFUS or the \nRed, from the colour of his hair; and HENRY, fond of learning, and \ncalled, in the Norman language, BEAUCLERC, or Fine-Scholar.  When \nRobert grew up, he asked of his father the government of Normandy, \nwhich he had nominally possessed, as a child, under his mother, \nMATILDA.  The King refusing to grant it, Robert became jealous and \ndiscontented; and happening one day, while in this temper, to be \nridiculed by his brothers, who threw water on him from a balcony as \nhe was walking before the door, he drew his sword, rushed up-\nstairs, and was only prevented by the King himself from putting \nthem to death.  That same night, he hotly departed with some \nfollowers from his father\'s court, and endeavoured to take the \nCastle of Rouen by surprise.  Failing in this, he shut himself up \nin another Castle in Normandy, which the King besieged, and where \nRobert one day unhorsed and nearly killed him without knowing who \nhe was.  His submission when he discovered his father, and the \nintercession of the queen and others, reconciled them; but not \nsoundly; for Robert soon strayed abroad, and went from court to \ncourt with his complaints.  He was a gay, careless, thoughtless \nfellow, spending all he got on musicians and dancers; but his \nmother loved him, and often, against the King\'s command, supplied \nhim with money through a messenger named SAMSON.  At length the \nincensed King swore he would tear out Samson\'s eyes; and Samson, \nthinking that his only hope of safety was in becoming a monk, \nbecame one, went on such errands no more, and kept his eyes in his \nhead.\n\nAll this time, from the turbulent day of his strange coronation, \nthe Conqueror had been struggling, you see, at any cost of cruelty \nand bloodshed, to maintain what he had seized.  All his reign, he \nstruggled still, with the same object ever before him.  He was a \nstern, bold man, and he succeeded in it.\n\nHe loved money, and was particular in his eating, but he had only \nleisure to indulge one other passion, and that was his love of \nhunting.  He carried it to such a height that he ordered whole \nvillages and towns to be swept away to make forests for the deer.  \nNot satisfied with sixty-eight Royal Forests, he laid waste an \nimmense district, to form another in Hampshire, called the New \nForest.  The many thousands of miserable peasants who saw their \nlittle houses pulled down, and themselves and children turned into \nthe open country without a shelter, detested him for his merciless \naddition to their many sufferings; and when, in the twenty-first \nyear of his reign (which proved to be the last), he went over to \nRouen, England was as full of hatred against him, as if every leaf \non every tree in all his Royal Forests had been a curse upon his \nhead.  In the New Forest, his son Richard (for he had four sons) \nhad been gored to death by a Stag; and the people said that this so \ncruelly-made Forest would yet be fatal to others of the Conqueror\'s \nrace.\n\nHe was engaged in a dispute with the King of France about some \nterritory.  While he stayed at Rouen, negotiating with that King, \nhe kept his bed and took medicines:  being advised by his \nphysicians to do so, on account of having grown to an unwieldy \nsize.  Word being brought to him that the King of France made light \nof this, and joked about it, he swore in a great rage that he \nshould rue his jests.  He assembled his army, marched into the \ndisputed territory, burnt - his old way! - the vines, the crops, \nand fruit, and set the town of Mantes on fire.  But, in an evil \nhour; for, as he rode over the hot ruins, his horse, setting his \nhoofs upon some burning embers, started, threw him forward against \nthe pommel of the saddle, and gave him a mortal hurt.  For six \nweeks he lay dying in a monastery near Rouen, and then made his \nwill, giving England to William, Normandy to Robert, and five \nthousand pounds to Henry.  And now, his violent deeds lay heavy on \nhis mind.  He ordered money to be given to many English churches \nand monasteries, and - which was much better repentance - released \nhis prisoners of state, some of whom had been confined in his \ndungeons twenty years.\n\nIt was a September morning, and the sun was rising, when the King \nwas awakened from slumber by the sound of a church bell.  \'What \nbell is that?\' he faintly asked.  They told him it was the bell of \nthe chapel of Saint Mary.  \'I commend my soul,\' said he, \'to Mary!\' \nand died.\n\nThink of his name, The Conqueror, and then consider how he lay in \ndeath!  The moment he was dead, his physicians, priests, and \nnobles, not knowing what contest for the throne might now take \nplace, or what might happen in it, hastened away, each man for \nhimself and his own property; the mercenary servants of the court \nbegan to rob and plunder; the body of the King, in the indecent \nstrife, was rolled from the bed, and lay alone, for hours, upon the \nground.  O Conqueror, of whom so many great names are proud now, of \nwhom so many great names thought nothing then, it were better to \nhave conquered one true heart, than England!\n\nBy-and-by, the priests came creeping in with prayers and candles; \nand a good knight, named HERLUIN, undertook (which no one else \nwould do) to convey the body to Caen, in Normandy, in order that it \nmight be buried in St. Stephen\'s church there, which the Conqueror \nhad founded.  But fire, of which he had made such bad use in his \nlife, seemed to follow him of itself in death.  A great \nconflagration broke out in the town when the body was placed in the \nchurch; and those present running out to extinguish the flames, it \nwas once again left alone.\n\nIt was not even buried in peace.  It was about to be let down, in \nits Royal robes, into a tomb near the high altar, in presence of a \ngreat concourse of people, when a loud voice in the crowd cried \nout, \'This ground is mine!  Upon it, stood my father\'s house.  This \nKing despoiled me of both ground and house to build this church.  \nIn the great name of GOD, I here forbid his body to be covered with \nthe earth that is my right!\'  The priests and bishops present, \nknowing the speaker\'s right, and knowing that the King had often \ndenied him justice, paid him down sixty shillings for the grave.  \nEven then, the corpse was not at rest.  The tomb was too small, and \nthey tried to force it in.  It broke, a dreadful smell arose, the \npeople hurried out into the air, and, for the third time, it was \nleft alone.\n\nWhere were the Conqueror\'s three sons, that they were not at their \nfather\'s burial?  Robert was lounging among minstrels, dancers, and \ngamesters, in France or Germany.  Henry was carrying his five \nthousand pounds safely away in a convenient chest he had got made.  \nWilliam the Red was hurrying to England, to lay hands upon the \nRoyal treasure and the crown.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX - ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE SECOND, CALLED RUFUS\n\n\n\nWILLIAM THE RED, in breathless haste, secured the three great forts \nof Dover, Pevensey, and Hastings, and made with hot speed for \nWinchester, where the Royal treasure was kept.  The treasurer \ndelivering him the keys, he found that it amounted to sixty \nthousand pounds in silver, besides gold and jewels.  Possessed of \nthis wealth, he soon persuaded the Archbishop of Canterbury to \ncrown him, and became William the Second, King of England.\n\nRufus was no sooner on the throne, than he ordered into prison \nagain the unhappy state captives whom his father had set free, and \ndirected a goldsmith to ornament his father\'s tomb profusely with \ngold and silver.  It would have been more dutiful in him to have \nattended the sick Conqueror when he was dying; but England itself, \nlike this Red King, who once governed it, has sometimes made \nexpensive tombs for dead men whom it treated shabbily when they \nwere alive.\n\nThe King\'s brother, Robert of Normandy, seeming quite content to be \nonly Duke of that country; and the King\'s other brother, Fine-\nScholar, being quiet enough with his five thousand pounds in a \nchest; the King flattered himself, we may suppose, with the hope of \nan easy reign.  But easy reigns were difficult to have in those \ndays.  The turbulent Bishop ODO (who had blessed the Norman army at \nthe Battle of Hastings, and who, I dare say, took all the credit of \nthe victory to himself) soon began, in concert with some powerful \nNorman nobles, to trouble the Red King.\n\nThe truth seems to be that this bishop and his friends, who had \nlands in England and lands in Normandy, wished to hold both under \none Sovereign; and greatly preferred a thoughtless good-natured \nperson, such as Robert was, to Rufus; who, though far from being an \namiable man in any respect, was keen, and not to be imposed upon.  \nThey declared in Robert\'s favour, and retired to their castles \n(those castles were very troublesome to kings) in a sullen humour.  \nThe Red King, seeing the Normans thus falling from him, revenged \nhimself upon them by appealing to the English; to whom he made a \nvariety of promises, which he never meant to perform - in \nparticular, promises to soften the cruelty of the Forest Laws; and \nwho, in return, so aided him with their valour, that ODO was \nbesieged in the Castle of Rochester, and forced to abandon it, and \nto depart from England for ever:  whereupon the other rebellious \nNorman nobles were soon reduced and scattered.\n\nThen, the Red King went over to Normandy, where the people suffered \ngreatly under the loose rule of Duke Robert.  The King\'s object was \nto seize upon the Duke\'s dominions.  This, the Duke, of course, \nprepared to resist; and miserable war between the two brothers \nseemed inevitable, when the powerful nobles on both sides, who had \nseen so much of war, interfered to prevent it.  A treaty was made.  \nEach of the two brothers agreed to give up something of his claims, \nand that the longer-liver of the two should inherit all the \ndominions of the other.  When they had come to this loving \nunderstanding, they embraced and joined their forces against Fine-\nScholar; who had bought some territory of Robert with a part of his \nfive thousand pounds, and was considered a dangerous individual in \nconsequence.\n\nSt. Michael\'s Mount, in Normandy (there is another St. Michael\'s \nMount, in Cornwall, wonderfully like it), was then, as it is now, a \nstrong place perched upon the top of a high rock, around which, \nwhen the tide is in, the sea flows, leaving no road to the \nmainland.  In this place, Fine-Scholar shut himself up with his \nsoldiers, and here he was closely besieged by his two brothers.  At \none time, when he was reduced to great distress for want of water, \nthe generous Robert not only permitted his men to get water, but \nsent Fine-Scholar wine from his own table; and, on being \nremonstrated with by the Red King, said \'What! shall we let our own \nbrother die of thirst?  Where shall we get another, when he is \ngone?\'  At another time, the Red King riding alone on the shore of \nthe bay, looking up at the Castle, was taken by two of Fine-\nScholar\'s men, one of whom was about to kill him, when he cried \nout, \'Hold, knave!  I am the King of England!\'  The story says that \nthe soldier raised him from the ground respectfully and humbly, and \nthat the King took him into his service.  The story may or may not \nbe true; but at any rate it is true that Fine-Scholar could not \nhold out against his united brothers, and that he abandoned Mount \nSt. Michael, and wandered about - as poor and forlorn as other \nscholars have been sometimes known to be.\n\nThe Scotch became unquiet in the Red King\'s time, and were twice \ndefeated - the second time, with the loss of their King, Malcolm, \nand his son.  The Welsh became unquiet too.  Against them, Rufus \nwas less successful; for they fought among their native mountains, \nand did great execution on the King\'s troops.  Robert of Normandy \nbecame unquiet too; and, complaining that his brother the King did \nnot faithfully perform his part of their agreement, took up arms, \nand obtained assistance from the King of France, whom Rufus, in the \nend, bought off with vast sums of money.  England became unquiet \ntoo.  Lord Mowbray, the powerful Earl of Northumberland, headed a \ngreat conspiracy to depose the King, and to place upon the throne, \nSTEPHEN, the Conqueror\'s near relative.  The plot was discovered; \nall the chief conspirators were seized; some were fined, some were \nput in prison, some were put to death.  The Earl of Northumberland \nhimself was shut up in a dungeon beneath Windsor Castle, where he \ndied, an old man, thirty long years afterwards.  The Priests in \nEngland were more unquiet than any other class or power; for the \nRed King treated them with such small ceremony that he refused to \nappoint new bishops or archbishops when the old ones died, but kept \nall the wealth belonging to those offices in his own hands.  In \nreturn for this, the Priests wrote his life when he was dead, and \nabused him well.  I am inclined to think, myself, that there was \nlittle to choose between the Priests and the Red King; that both \nsides were greedy and designing; and that they were fairly matched.\n\nThe Red King was false of heart, selfish, covetous, and mean.  He \nhad a worthy minister in his favourite, Ralph, nicknamed - for \nalmost every famous person had a nickname in those rough days - \nFlambard, or the Firebrand.  Once, the King being ill, became \npenitent, and made ANSELM, a foreign priest and a good man, \nArchbishop of Canterbury.  But he no sooner got well again than he \nrepented of his repentance, and persisted in wrongfully keeping to \nhimself some of the wealth belonging to the archbishopric.  This \nled to violent disputes, which were aggravated by there being in \nRome at that time two rival Popes; each of whom declared he was the \nonly real original infallible Pope, who couldn\'t make a mistake.  \nAt last, Anselm, knowing the Red King\'s character, and not feeling \nhimself safe in England, asked leave to return abroad.  The Red \nKing gladly gave it; for he knew that as soon as Anselm was gone, \nhe could begin to store up all the Canterbury money again, for his \nown use.\n\nBy such means, and by taxing and oppressing the English people in \nevery possible way, the Red King became very rich.  When he wanted \nmoney for any purpose, he raised it by some means or other, and \ncared nothing for the injustice he did, or the misery he caused.  \nHaving the opportunity of buying from Robert the whole duchy of \nNormandy for five years, he taxed the English people more than \never, and made the very convents sell their plate and valuables to \nsupply him with the means to make the purchase.  But he was as \nquick and eager in putting down revolt as he was in raising money; \nfor, a part of the Norman people objecting - very naturally, I \nthink - to being sold in this way, he headed an army against them \nwith all the speed and energy of his father.  He was so impatient, \nthat he embarked for Normandy in a great gale of wind.  And when \nthe sailors told him it was dangerous to go to sea in such angry \nweather, he replied, \'Hoist sail and away!  Did you ever hear of a \nking who was drowned?\'\n\nYou will wonder how it was that even the careless Robert came to \nsell his dominions.  It happened thus.  It had long been the custom \nfor many English people to make journeys to Jerusalem, which were \ncalled pilgrimages, in order that they might pray beside the tomb \nof Our Saviour there.  Jerusalem belonging to the Turks, and the \nTurks hating Christianity, these Christian travellers were often \ninsulted and ill used.  The Pilgrims bore it patiently for some \ntime, but at length a remarkable man, of great earnestness and \neloquence, called PETER THE HERMIT, began to preach in various \nplaces against the Turks, and to declare that it was the duty of \ngood Christians to drive away those unbelievers from the tomb of \nOur Saviour, and to take possession of it, and protect it.  An \nexcitement such as the world had never known before was created.  \nThousands and thousands of men of all ranks and conditions departed \nfor Jerusalem to make war against the Turks.  The war is called in \nhistory the first Crusade, and every Crusader wore a cross marked \non his right shoulder.\n\nAll the Crusaders were not zealous Christians.  Among them were \nvast numbers of the restless, idle, profligate, and adventurous \nspirit of the time.  Some became Crusaders for the love of change; \nsome, in the hope of plunder; some, because they had nothing to do \nat home; some, because they did what the priests told them; some, \nbecause they liked to see foreign countries; some, because they \nwere fond of knocking men about, and would as soon knock a Turk \nabout as a Christian.  Robert of Normandy may have been influenced \nby all these motives; and by a kind desire, besides, to save the \nChristian Pilgrims from bad treatment in future.  He wanted to \nraise a number of armed men, and to go to the Crusade.  He could \nnot do so without money.  He had no money; and he sold his \ndominions to his brother, the Red King, for five years.  With the \nlarge sum he thus obtained, he fitted out his Crusaders gallantly, \nand went away to Jerusalem in martial state.  The Red King, who \nmade money out of everything, stayed at home, busily squeezing more \nmoney out of Normans and English.\n\nAfter three years of great hardship and suffering - from shipwreck \nat sea; from travel in strange lands; from hunger, thirst, and \nfever, upon the burning sands of the desert; and from the fury of \nthe Turks - the valiant Crusaders got possession of Our Saviour\'s \ntomb.  The Turks were still resisting and fighting bravely, but \nthis success increased the general desire in Europe to join the \nCrusade.  Another great French Duke was proposing to sell his \ndominions for a term to the rich Red King, when the Red King\'s \nreign came to a sudden and violent end.\n\nYou have not forgotten the New Forest which the Conqueror made, and \nwhich the miserable people whose homes he had laid waste, so hated.  \nThe cruelty of the Forest Laws, and the torture and death they \nbrought upon the peasantry, increased this hatred.  The poor \npersecuted country people believed that the New Forest was \nenchanted.  They said that in thunder-storms, and on dark nights, \ndemons appeared, moving beneath the branches of the gloomy trees.  \nThey said that a terrible spectre had foretold to Norman hunters \nthat the Red King should be punished there.  And now, in the \npleasant season of May, when the Red King had reigned almost \nthirteen years; and a second Prince of the Conqueror\'s blood - \nanother Richard, the son of Duke Robert - was killed by an arrow in \nthis dreaded Forest; the people said that the second time was not \nthe last, and that there was another death to come.\n\nIt was a lonely forest, accursed in the people\'s hearts for the \nwicked deeds that had been done to make it; and no man save the \nKing and his Courtiers and Huntsmen, liked to stray there.  But, in \nreality, it was like any other forest.  In the spring, the green \nleaves broke out of the buds; in the summer, flourished heartily, \nand made deep shades; in the winter, shrivelled and blew down, and \nlay in brown heaps on the moss.  Some trees were stately, and grew \nhigh and strong; some had fallen of themselves; some were felled by \nthe forester\'s axe; some were hollow, and the rabbits burrowed at \ntheir roots; some few were struck by lightning, and stood white and \nbare.  There were hill-sides covered with rich fern, on which the \nmorning dew so beautifully sparkled; there were brooks, where the \ndeer went down to drink, or over which the whole herd bounded, \nflying from the arrows of the huntsmen; there were sunny glades, \nand solemn places where but little light came through the rustling \nleaves.  The songs of the birds in the New Forest were pleasanter \nto hear than the shouts of fighting men outside; and even when the \nRed King and his Court came hunting through its solitudes, cursing \nloud and riding hard, with a jingling of stirrups and bridles and \nknives and daggers, they did much less harm there than among the \nEnglish or Normans, and the stags died (as they lived) far easier \nthan the people.\n\nUpon a day in August, the Red King, now reconciled to his brother, \nFine-Scholar, came with a great train to hunt in the New Forest.  \nFine-Scholar was of the party.  They were a merry party, and had \nlain all night at Malwood-Keep, a hunting-lodge in the forest, \nwhere they had made good cheer, both at supper and breakfast, and \nhad drunk a deal of wine.  The party dispersed in various \ndirections, as the custom of hunters then was.  The King took with \nhim only SIR WALTER TYRREL, who was a famous sportsman, and to whom \nhe had given, before they mounted horse that morning, two fine \narrows.\n\nThe last time the King was ever seen alive, he was riding with Sir \nWalter Tyrrel, and their dogs were hunting together.\n\nIt was almost night, when a poor charcoal-burner, passing through \nthe forest with his cart, came upon the solitary body of a dead \nman, shot with an arrow in the breast, and still bleeding.  He got \nit into his cart.  It was the body of the King.  Shaken and \ntumbled, with its red beard all whitened with lime and clotted with \nblood, it was driven in the cart by the charcoal-burner next day to \nWinchester Cathedral, where it was received and buried.\n\nSir Walter Tyrrel, who escaped to Normandy, and claimed the \nprotection of the King of France, swore in France that the Red King \nwas suddenly shot dead by an arrow from an unseen hand, while they \nwere hunting together; that he was fearful of being suspected as \nthe King\'s murderer; and that he instantly set spurs to his horse, \nand fled to the sea-shore.  Others declared that the King and Sir \nWalter Tyrrel were hunting in company, a little before sunset, \nstanding in bushes opposite one another, when a stag came between \nthem.  That the King drew his bow and took aim, but the string \nbroke.  That the King then cried, \'Shoot, Walter, in the Devil\'s \nname!\'  That Sir Walter shot.  That the arrow glanced against a \ntree, was turned aside from the stag, and struck the King from his \nhorse, dead.\n\nBy whose hand the Red King really fell, and whether that hand \ndespatched the arrow to his breast by accident or by design, is \nonly known to GOD.  Some think his brother may have caused him to \nbe killed; but the Red King had made so many enemies, both among \npriests and people, that suspicion may reasonably rest upon a less \nunnatural murderer.  Men know no more than that he was found dead \nin the New Forest, which the suffering people had regarded as a \ndoomed ground for his race.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIRST, CALLED FINE-SCHOLAR\n\n\n\nFINE-SCHOLAR, on hearing of the Red King\'s death, hurried to \nWinchester with as much speed as Rufus himself had made, to seize \nthe Royal treasure.  But the keeper of the treasure who had been \none of the hunting-party in the Forest, made haste to Winchester \ntoo, and, arriving there at about the same time, refused to yield \nit up.  Upon this, Fine-Scholar drew his sword, and threatened to \nkill the treasurer; who might have paid for his fidelity with his \nlife, but that he knew longer resistance to be useless when he \nfound the Prince supported by a company of powerful barons, who \ndeclared they were determined to make him King.  The treasurer, \ntherefore, gave up the money and jewels of the Crown:  and on the \nthird day after the death of the Red King, being a Sunday, Fine-\nScholar stood before the high altar in Westminster Abbey, and made \na solemn declaration that he would resign the Church property which \nhis brother had seized; that he would do no wrong to the nobles; \nand that he would restore to the people the laws of Edward the \nConfessor, with all the improvements of William the Conqueror.  So \nbegan the reign of KING HENRY THE FIRST.\n\nThe people were attached to their new King, both because he had \nknown distresses, and because he was an Englishman by birth and not \na Norman.  To strengthen this last hold upon them, the King wished \nto marry an English lady; and could think of no other wife than \nMAUD THE GOOD, the daughter of the King of Scotland.  Although this \ngood Princess did not love the King, she was so affected by the \nrepresentations the nobles made to her of the great charity it \nwould be in her to unite the Norman and Saxon races, and prevent \nhatred and bloodshed between them for the future, that she \nconsented to become his wife.  After some disputing among the \npriests, who said that as she had been in a convent in her youth, \nand had worn the veil of a nun, she could not lawfully be married - \nagainst which the Princess stated that her aunt, with whom she had \nlived in her youth, had indeed sometimes thrown a piece of black \nstuff over her, but for no other reason than because the nun\'s veil \nwas the only dress the conquering Normans respected in girl or \nwoman, and not because she had taken the vows of a nun, which she \nnever had - she was declared free to marry, and was made King \nHenry\'s Queen.  A good Queen she was; beautiful, kind-hearted, and \nworthy of a better husband than the King.\n\nFor he was a cunning and unscrupulous man, though firm and clever.  \nHe cared very little for his word, and took any means to gain his \nends.  All this is shown in his treatment of his brother Robert - \nRobert, who had suffered him to be refreshed with water, and who \nhad sent him the wine from his own table, when he was shut up, with \nthe crows flying below him, parched with thirst, in the castle on \nthe top of St. Michael\'s Mount, where his Red brother would have \nlet him die.\n\nBefore the King began to deal with Robert, he removed and disgraced \nall the favourites of the late King; who were for the most part \nbase characters, much detested by the people.  Flambard, or \nFirebrand, whom the late King had made Bishop of Durham, of all \nthings in the world, Henry imprisoned in the Tower; but Firebrand \nwas a great joker and a jolly companion, and made himself so \npopular with his guards that they pretended to know nothing about a \nlong rope that was sent into his prison at the bottom of a deep \nflagon of wine.  The guards took the wine, and Firebrand took the \nrope; with which, when they were fast asleep, he let himself down \nfrom a window in the night, and so got cleverly aboard ship and \naway to Normandy.\n\nNow Robert, when his brother Fine-Scholar came to the throne, was \nstill absent in the Holy Land.  Henry pretended that Robert had \nbeen made Sovereign of that country; and he had been away so long, \nthat the ignorant people believed it.  But, behold, when Henry had \nbeen some time King of England, Robert came home to Normandy; \nhaving leisurely returned from Jerusalem through Italy, in which \nbeautiful country he had enjoyed himself very much, and had married \na lady as beautiful as itself!  In Normandy, he found Firebrand \nwaiting to urge him to assert his claim to the English crown, and \ndeclare war against King Henry.  This, after great loss of time in \nfeasting and dancing with his beautiful Italian wife among his \nNorman friends, he at last did.\n\nThe English in general were on King Henry\'s side, though many of \nthe Normans were on Robert\'s.  But the English sailors deserted the \nKing, and took a great part of the English fleet over to Normandy; \nso that Robert came to invade this country in no foreign vessels, \nbut in English ships.  The virtuous Anselm, however, whom Henry had \ninvited back from abroad, and made Archbishop of Canterbury, was \nsteadfast in the King\'s cause; and it was so well supported that \nthe two armies, instead of fighting, made a peace.  Poor Robert, \nwho trusted anybody and everybody, readily trusted his brother, the \nKing; and agreed to go home and receive a pension from England, on \ncondition that all his followers were fully pardoned.  This the \nKing very faithfully promised, but Robert was no sooner gone than \nhe began to punish them.\n\nAmong them was the Earl of Shrewsbury, who, on being summoned by \nthe King to answer to five-and-forty accusations, rode away to one \nof his strong castles, shut himself up therein, called around him \nhis tenants and vassals, and fought for his liberty, but was \ndefeated and banished.  Robert, with all his faults, was so true to \nhis word, that when he first heard of this nobleman having risen \nagainst his brother, he laid waste the Earl of Shrewsbury\'s estates \nin Normandy, to show the King that he would favour no breach of \ntheir treaty.  Finding, on better information, afterwards, that the \nEarl\'s only crime was having been his friend, he came over to \nEngland, in his old thoughtless, warm-hearted way, to intercede \nwith the King, and remind him of the solemn promise to pardon all \nhis followers.\n\nThis confidence might have put the false King to the blush, but it \ndid not.  Pretending to be very friendly, he so surrounded his \nbrother with spies and traps, that Robert, who was quite in his \npower, had nothing for it but to renounce his pension and escape \nwhile he could.  Getting home to Normandy, and understanding the \nKing better now, he naturally allied himself with his old friend \nthe Earl of Shrewsbury, who had still thirty castles in that \ncountry.  This was exactly what Henry wanted.  He immediately \ndeclared that Robert had broken the treaty, and next year invaded \nNormandy.\n\nHe pretended that he came to deliver the Normans, at their own \nrequest, from his brother\'s misrule.  There is reason to fear that \nhis misrule was bad enough; for his beautiful wife had died, \nleaving him with an infant son, and his court was again so \ncareless, dissipated, and ill-regulated, that it was said he \nsometimes lay in bed of a day for want of clothes to put on - his \nattendants having stolen all his dresses.  But he headed his army \nlike a brave prince and a gallant soldier, though he had the \nmisfortune to be taken prisoner by King Henry, with four hundred of \nhis Knights.  Among them was poor harmless Edgar Atheling, who \nloved Robert well.  Edgar was not important enough to be severe \nwith.  The King afterwards gave him a small pension, which he lived \nupon and died upon, in peace, among the quiet woods and fields of \nEngland.\n\nAnd Robert - poor, kind, generous, wasteful, heedless Robert, with \nso many faults, and yet with virtues that might have made a better \nand a happier man - what was the end of him?  If the King had had \nthe magnanimity to say with a kind air, \'Brother, tell me, before \nthese noblemen, that from this time you will be my faithful \nfollower and friend, and never raise your hand against me or my \nforces more!\' he might have trusted Robert to the death.  But the \nKing was not a magnanimous man.  He sentenced his brother to be \nconfined for life in one of the Royal Castles.  In the beginning of \nhis imprisonment, he was allowed to ride out, guarded; but he one \nday broke away from his guard and galloped of.  He had the evil \nfortune to ride into a swamp, where his horse stuck fast and he was \ntaken.  When the King heard of it he ordered him to be blinded, \nwhich was done by putting a red-hot metal basin on his eyes.\n\nAnd so, in darkness and in prison, many years, he thought of all \nhis past life, of the time he had wasted, of the treasure he had \nsquandered, of the opportunities he had lost, of the youth he had \nthrown away, of the talents he had neglected.  Sometimes, on fine \nautumn mornings, he would sit and think of the old hunting parties \nin the free Forest, where he had been the foremost and the gayest.  \nSometimes, in the still nights, he would wake, and mourn for the \nmany nights that had stolen past him at the gaming-table; \nsometimes, would seem to hear, upon the melancholy wind, the old \nsongs of the minstrels; sometimes, would dream, in his blindness, \nof the light and glitter of the Norman Court.  Many and many a \ntime, he groped back, in his fancy, to Jerusalem, where he had \nfought so well; or, at the head of his brave companions, bowed his \nfeathered helmet to the shouts of welcome greeting him in Italy, \nand seemed again to walk among the sunny vineyards, or on the shore \nof the blue sea, with his lovely wife.  And then, thinking of her \ngrave, and of his fatherless boy, he would stretch out his solitary \narms and weep.\n\nAt length, one day, there lay in prison, dead, with cruel and \ndisfiguring scars upon his eyelids, bandaged from his jailer\'s \nsight, but on which the eternal Heavens looked down, a worn old man \nof eighty.  He had once been Robert of Normandy.  Pity him!\n\nAt the time when Robert of Normandy was taken prisoner by his \nbrother, Robert\'s little son was only five years old.  This child \nwas taken, too, and carried before the King, sobbing and crying; \nfor, young as he was, he knew he had good reason to be afraid of \nhis Royal uncle.  The King was not much accustomed to pity those \nwho were in his power, but his cold heart seemed for the moment to \nsoften towards the boy.  He was observed to make a great effort, as \nif to prevent himself from being cruel, and ordered the child to be \ntaken away; whereupon a certain Baron, who had married a daughter \nof Duke Robert\'s (by name, Helie of Saint Saen), took charge of \nhim, tenderly.  The King\'s gentleness did not last long.  Before \ntwo years were over, he sent messengers to this lord\'s Castle to \nseize the child and bring him away.  The Baron was not there at the \ntime, but his servants were faithful, and carried the boy off in \nhis sleep and hid him.  When the Baron came home, and was told what \nthe King had done, he took the child abroad, and, leading him by \nthe hand, went from King to King and from Court to Court, relating \nhow the child had a claim to the throne of England, and how his \nuncle the King, knowing that he had that claim, would have murdered \nhim, perhaps, but for his escape.\n\nThe youth and innocence of the pretty little WILLIAM FITZ-ROBERT \n(for that was his name) made him many friends at that time.  When \nhe became a young man, the King of France, uniting with the French \nCounts of Anjou and Flanders, supported his cause against the King \nof England, and took many of the King\'s towns and castles in \nNormandy.  But, King Henry, artful and cunning always, bribed some \nof William\'s friends with money, some with promises, some with \npower.  He bought off the Count of Anjou, by promising to marry his \neldest son, also named WILLIAM, to the Count\'s daughter; and indeed \nthe whole trust of this King\'s life was in such bargains, and he \nbelieved (as many another King has done since, and as one King did \nin France a very little time ago) that every man\'s truth and honour \ncan be bought at some price.  For all this, he was so afraid of \nWilliam Fitz-Robert and his friends, that, for a long time, he \nbelieved his life to be in danger; and never lay down to sleep, \neven in his palace surrounded by his guards, without having a sword \nand buckler at his bedside.\n\nTo strengthen his power, the King with great ceremony betrothed his \neldest daughter MATILDA, then a child only eight years old, to be \nthe wife of Henry the Fifth, the Emperor of Germany.  To raise her \nmarriage-portion, he taxed the English people in a most oppressive \nmanner; then treated them to a great procession, to restore their \ngood humour; and sent Matilda away, in fine state, with the German \nambassadors, to be educated in the country of her future husband.\n\nAnd now his Queen, Maud the Good, unhappily died.  It was a sad \nthought for that gentle lady, that the only hope with which she had \nmarried a man whom she had never loved - the hope of reconciling \nthe Norman and English races - had failed.  At the very time of her \ndeath, Normandy and all France was in arms against England; for, so \nsoon as his last danger was over, King Henry had been false to all \nthe French powers he had promised, bribed, and bought, and they had \nnaturally united against him.  After some fighting, however, in \nwhich few suffered but the unhappy common people (who always \nsuffered, whatsoever was the matter), he began to promise, bribe, \nand buy again; and by those means, and by the help of the Pope, who \nexerted himself to save more bloodshed, and by solemnly declaring, \nover and over again, that he really was in earnest this time, and \nwould keep his word, the King made peace.\n\nOne of the first consequences of this peace was, that the King went \nover to Normandy with his son Prince William and a great retinue, \nto have the Prince acknowledged as his successor by the Norman \nNobles, and to contract the promised marriage (this was one of the \nmany promises the King had broken) between him and the daughter of \nthe Count of Anjou.  Both these things were triumphantly done, with \ngreat show and rejoicing; and on the twenty-fifth of November, in \nthe year one thousand one hundred and twenty, the whole retinue \nprepared to embark at the Port of Barfleur, for the voyage home.\n\nOn that day, and at that place, there came to the King, Fitz-\nStephen, a sea-captain, and said:\n\n\'My liege, my father served your father all his life, upon the sea.  \nHe steered the ship with the golden boy upon the prow, in which \nyour father sailed to conquer England.  I beseech you to grant me \nthe same office.  I have a fair vessel in the harbour here, called \nThe White Ship, manned by fifty sailors of renown.  I pray you, \nSire, to let your servant have the honour of steering you in The \nWhite Ship to England!\'\n\n\'I am sorry, friend,\' replied the King, \'that my vessel is already \nchosen, and that I cannot (therefore) sail with the son of the man \nwho served my father.  But the Prince and all his company shall go \nalong with you, in the fair White Ship, manned by the fifty sailors \nof renown.\'\n\nAn hour or two afterwards, the King set sail in the vessel he had \nchosen, accompanied by other vessels, and, sailing all night with a \nfair and gentle wind, arrived upon the coast of England in the \nmorning.  While it was yet night, the people in some of those ships \nheard a faint wild cry come over the sea, and wondered what it was.\n\nNow, the Prince was a dissolute, debauched young man of eighteen, \nwho bore no love to the English, and had declared that when he came \nto the throne he would yoke them to the plough like oxen.  He went \naboard The White Ship, with one hundred and forty youthful Nobles \nlike himself, among whom were eighteen noble ladies of the highest \nrank.  All this gay company, with their servants and the fifty \nsailors, made three hundred souls aboard the fair White Ship.\n\n\'Give three casks of wine, Fitz-Stephen,\' said the Prince, \'to the \nfifty sailors of renown!  My father the King has sailed out of the \nharbour.  What time is there to make merry here, and yet reach \nEngland with the rest?\'\n\n\'Prince!\' said Fitz-Stephen, \'before morning, my fifty and The \nWhite Ship shall overtake the swiftest vessel in attendance on your \nfather the King, if we sail at midnight!\'\n\nThen the Prince commanded to make merry; and the sailors drank out \nthe three casks of wine; and the Prince and all the noble company \ndanced in the moonlight on the deck of The White Ship.\n\nWhen, at last, she shot out of the harbour of Barfleur, there was \nnot a sober seaman on board.  But the sails were all set, and the \noars all going merrily.  Fitz-Stephen had the helm.  The gay young \nnobles and the beautiful ladies, wrapped in mantles of various \nbright colours to protect them from the cold, talked, laughed, and \nsang.  The Prince encouraged the fifty sailors to row harder yet, \nfor the honour of The White Ship.\n\nCrash!  A terrific cry broke from three hundred hearts.  It was the \ncry the people in the distant vessels of the King heard faintly on \nthe water.  The White Ship had struck upon a rock - was filling - \ngoing down!\n\nFitz-Stephen hurried the Prince into a boat, with some few Nobles.  \n\'Push off,\' he whispered; \'and row to land.  It is not far, and the \nsea is smooth.  The rest of us must die.\'\n\nBut, as they rowed away, fast, from the sinking ship, the Prince \nheard the voice of his sister MARIE, the Countess of Perche, \ncalling for help.  He never in his life had been so good as he was \nthen.  He cried in an agony, \'Row back at any risk!  I cannot bear \nto leave her!\'\n\nThey rowed back.  As the Prince held out his arms to catch his \nsister, such numbers leaped in, that the boat was overset.  And in \nthe same instant The White Ship went down.\n\nOnly two men floated.  They both clung to the main yard of the \nship, which had broken from the mast, and now supported them.  One \nasked the other who he was?  He said, \'I am a nobleman, GODFREY by \nname, the son of GILBERT DE L\'AIGLE.  And you?\' said he.  \'I am \nBEROLD, a poor butcher of Rouen,\' was the answer.  Then, they said \ntogether, \'Lord be merciful to us both!\' and tried to encourage one \nanother, as they drifted in the cold benumbing sea on that \nunfortunate November night.\n\nBy-and-by, another man came swimming towards them, whom they knew, \nwhen he pushed aside his long wet hair, to be Fitz-Stephen.  \'Where \nis the Prince?\' said he.  \'Gone! Gone!\' the two cried together.  \n\'Neither he, nor his brother, nor his sister, nor the King\'s niece, \nnor her brother, nor any one of all the brave three hundred, noble \nor commoner, except we three, has risen above the water!\'  Fitz-\nStephen, with a ghastly face, cried, \'Woe! woe, to me!\' and sunk to \nthe bottom.\n\nThe other two clung to the yard for some hours.  At length the \nyoung noble said faintly, \'I am exhausted, and chilled with the \ncold, and can hold no longer.  Farewell, good friend!  God preserve \nyou!\'  So, he dropped and sunk; and of all the brilliant crowd, the \npoor Butcher of Rouen alone was saved.  In the morning, some \nfishermen saw him floating in his sheep-skin coat, and got him into \ntheir boat - the sole relater of the dismal tale.\n\nFor three days, no one dared to carry the intelligence to the King.  \nAt length, they sent into his presence a little boy, who, weeping \nbitterly, and kneeling at his feet, told him that The White Ship \nwas lost with all on board.  The King fell to the ground like a \ndead man, and never, never afterwards, was seen to smile.\n\nBut he plotted again, and promised again, and bribed and bought \nagain, in his old deceitful way.  Having no son to succeed him, \nafter all his pains (\'The Prince will never yoke us to the plough, \nnow!\' said the English people), he took a second wife - ADELAIS or \nALICE, a duke\'s daughter, and the Pope\'s niece.  Having no more \nchildren, however, he proposed to the Barons to swear that they \nwould recognise as his successor, his daughter Matilda, whom, as \nshe was now a widow, he married to the eldest son of the Count of \nAnjou, GEOFFREY, surnamed PLANTAGENET, from a custom he had of \nwearing a sprig of flowering broom (called Genàt in French) in his \ncap for a feather.  As one false man usually makes many, and as a \nfalse King, in particular, is pretty certain to make a false Court, \nthe Barons took the oath about the succession of Matilda (and her \nchildren after her), twice over, without in the least intending to \nkeep it.  The King was now relieved from any remaining fears of \nWilliam Fitz-Robert, by his death in the Monastery of St. Omer, in \nFrance, at twenty-six years old, of a pike-wound in the hand.  And \nas Matilda gave birth to three sons, he thought the succession to \nthe throne secure.\n\nHe spent most of the latter part of his life, which was troubled by \nfamily quarrels, in Normandy, to be near Matilda.  When he had \nreigned upward of thirty-five years, and was sixty-seven years old, \nhe died of an indigestion and fever, brought on by eating, when he \nwas far from well, of a fish called Lamprey, against which he had \noften been cautioned by his physicians.  His remains were brought \nover to Reading Abbey to be buried.\n\nYou may perhaps hear the cunning and promise-breaking of King Henry \nthe First, called \'policy\' by some people, and \'diplomacy\' by \nothers.  Neither of these fine words will in the least mean that it \nwas true; and nothing that is not true can possibly be good.\n\nHis greatest merit, that I know of, was his love of learning - I \nshould have given him greater credit even for that, if it had been \nstrong enough to induce him to spare the eyes of a certain poet he \nonce took prisoner, who was a knight besides.  But he ordered the \npoet\'s eyes to be torn from his head, because he had laughed at him \nin his verses; and the poet, in the pain of that torture, dashed \nout his own brains against his prison wall.  King Henry the First \nwas avaricious, revengeful, and so false, that I suppose a man \nnever lived whose word was less to be relied upon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI - ENGLAND UNDER MATILDA AND STEPHEN\n\n\n\nTHE King was no sooner dead than all the plans and schemes he had \nlaboured at so long, and lied so much for, crumbled away like a \nhollow heap of sand.  STEPHEN, whom he had never mistrusted or \nsuspected, started up to claim the throne.\n\nStephen was the son of ADELA, the Conqueror\'s daughter, married to \nthe Count of Blois.  To Stephen, and to his brother HENRY, the late \nKing had been liberal; making Henry Bishop of Winchester, and \nfinding a good marriage for Stephen, and much enriching him.  This \ndid not prevent Stephen from hastily producing a false witness, a \nservant of the late King, to swear that the King had named him for \nhis heir upon his death-bed.  On this evidence the Archbishop of \nCanterbury crowned him.  The new King, so suddenly made, lost not a \nmoment in seizing the Royal treasure, and hiring foreign soldiers \nwith some of it to protect his throne.\n\nIf the dead King had even done as the false witness said, he would \nhave had small right to will away the English people, like so many \nsheep or oxen, without their consent.  But he had, in fact, \nbequeathed all his territory to Matilda; who, supported by ROBERT, \nEarl of Gloucester, soon began to dispute the crown.  Some of the \npowerful barons and priests took her side; some took Stephen\'s; all \nfortified their castles; and again the miserable English people \nwere involved in war, from which they could never derive advantage \nwhosoever was victorious, and in which all parties plundered, \ntortured, starved, and ruined them.\n\nFive years had passed since the death of Henry the First - and \nduring those five years there had been two terrible invasions by \nthe people of Scotland under their King, David, who was at last \ndefeated with all his army - when Matilda, attended by her brother \nRobert and a large force, appeared in England to maintain her \nclaim.  A battle was fought between her troops and King Stephen\'s \nat Lincoln; in which the King himself was taken prisoner, after \nbravely fighting until his battle-axe and sword were broken, and \nwas carried into strict confinement at Gloucester.  Matilda then \nsubmitted herself to the Priests, and the Priests crowned her Queen \nof England.\n\nShe did not long enjoy this dignity.  The people of London had a \ngreat affection for Stephen; many of the Barons considered it \ndegrading to be ruled by a woman; and the Queen\'s temper was so \nhaughty that she made innumerable enemies.  The people of London \nrevolted; and, in alliance with the troops of Stephen, besieged her \nat Winchester, where they took her brother Robert prisoner, whom, \nas her best soldier and chief general, she was glad to exchange for \nStephen himself, who thus regained his liberty.  Then, the long war \nwent on afresh.  Once, she was pressed so hard in the Castle of \nOxford, in the winter weather when the snow lay thick upon the \nground, that her only chance of escape was to dress herself all in \nwhite, and, accompanied by no more than three faithful Knights, \ndressed in like manner that their figures might not be seen from \nStephen\'s camp as they passed over the snow, to steal away on foot, \ncross the frozen Thames, walk a long distance, and at last gallop \naway on horseback.  All this she did, but to no great purpose then; \nfor her brother dying while the struggle was yet going on, she at \nlast withdrew to Normandy.\n\nIn two or three years after her withdrawal her cause appeared in \nEngland, afresh, in the person of her son Henry, young Plantagenet, \nwho, at only eighteen years of age, was very powerful:  not only on \naccount of his mother having resigned all Normandy to him, but also \nfrom his having married ELEANOR, the divorced wife of the French \nKing, a bad woman, who had great possessions in France.  Louis, the \nFrench King, not relishing this arrangement, helped EUSTACE, King \nStephen\'s son, to invade Normandy:  but Henry drove their united \nforces out of that country, and then returned here, to assist his \npartisans, whom the King was then besieging at Wallingford upon the \nThames.  Here, for two days, divided only by the river, the two \narmies lay encamped opposite to one another - on the eve, as it \nseemed to all men, of another desperate fight, when the EARL OF \nARUNDEL took heart and said \'that it was not reasonable to prolong \nthe unspeakable miseries of two kingdoms to minister to the \nambition of two princes.\'\n\nMany other noblemen repeating and supporting this when it was once \nuttered, Stephen and young Plantagenet went down, each to his own \nbank of the river, and held a conversation across it, in which they \narranged a truce; very much to the dissatisfaction of Eustace, who \nswaggered away with some followers, and laid violent hands on the \nAbbey of St. Edmund\'s-Bury, where he presently died mad.  The truce \nled to a solemn council at Winchester, in which it was agreed that \nStephen should retain the crown, on condition of his declaring \nHenry his successor; that WILLIAM, another son of the King\'s, \nshould inherit his father\'s rightful possessions; and that all the \nCrown lands which Stephen had given away should be recalled, and \nall the Castles he had permitted to be built demolished.  Thus \nterminated the bitter war, which had now lasted fifteen years, and \nhad again laid England waste.  In the next year STEPHEN died, after \na troubled reign of nineteen years.\n\nAlthough King Stephen was, for the time in which he lived, a humane \nand moderate man, with many excellent qualities; and although \nnothing worse is known of him than his usurpation of the Crown, \nwhich he probably excused to himself by the consideration that King \nHenry the First was a usurper too - which was no excuse at all; the \npeople of England suffered more in these dread nineteen years, than \nat any former period even of their suffering history.  In the \ndivision of the nobility between the two rival claimants of the \nCrown, and in the growth of what is called the Feudal System (which \nmade the peasants the born vassals and mere slaves of the Barons), \nevery Noble had his strong Castle, where he reigned the cruel king \nof all the neighbouring people.  Accordingly, he perpetrated \nwhatever cruelties he chose.  And never were worse cruelties \ncommitted upon earth than in wretched England in those nineteen \nyears.\n\nThe writers who were living then describe them fearfully.  They say \nthat the castles were filled with devils rather than with men; that \nthe peasants, men and women, were put into dungeons for their gold \nand silver, were tortured with fire and smoke, were hung up by the \nthumbs, were hung up by the heels with great weights to their \nheads, were torn with jagged irons, killed with hunger, broken to \ndeath in narrow chests filled with sharp-pointed stones, murdered \nin countless fiendish ways.  In England there was no corn, no meat, \nno cheese, no butter, there were no tilled lands, no harvests.  \nAshes of burnt towns, and dreary wastes, were all that the \ntraveller, fearful of the robbers who prowled abroad at all hours, \nwould see in a long day\'s journey; and from sunrise until night, he \nwould not come upon a home.\n\nThe clergy sometimes suffered, and heavily too, from pillage, but \nmany of them had castles of their own, and fought in helmet and \narmour like the barons, and drew lots with other fighting men for \ntheir share of booty.  The Pope (or Bishop of Rome), on King \nStephen\'s resisting his ambition, laid England under an Interdict \nat one period of this reign; which means that he allowed no service \nto be performed in the churches, no couples to be married, no bells \nto be rung, no dead bodies to be buried.  Any man having the power \nto refuse these things, no matter whether he were called a Pope or \na Poulterer, would, of course, have the power of afflicting numbers \nof innocent people.  That nothing might be wanting to the miseries \nof King Stephen\'s time, the Pope threw in this contribution to the \npublic store - not very like the widow\'s contribution, as I think, \nwhen Our Saviour sat in Jerusalem over-against the Treasury, \'and \nshe threw in two mites, which make a farthing.\'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SECOND - PART THE FIRST\n\n\n\nHENRY PLANTAGENET, when he was but twenty-one years old, quietly \nsucceeded to the throne of England, according to his agreement made \nwith the late King at Winchester.  Six weeks after Stephen\'s death, \nhe and his Queen, Eleanor, were crowned in that city; into which \nthey rode on horseback in great state, side by side, amidst much \nshouting and rejoicing, and clashing of music, and strewing of \nflowers.\n\nThe reign of King Henry the Second began well.  The King had great \npossessions, and (what with his own rights, and what with those of \nhis wife) was lord of one-third part of France.  He was a young man \nof vigour, ability, and resolution, and immediately applied himself \nto remove some of the evils which had arisen in the last unhappy \nreign.  He revoked all the grants of land that had been hastily \nmade, on either side, during the late struggles; he obliged numbers \nof disorderly soldiers to depart from England; he reclaimed all the \ncastles belonging to the Crown; and he forced the wicked nobles to \npull down their own castles, to the number of eleven hundred, in \nwhich such dismal cruelties had been inflicted on the people.  The \nKing\'s brother, GEOFFREY, rose against him in France, while he was \nso well employed, and rendered it necessary for him to repair to \nthat country; where, after he had subdued and made a friendly \narrangement with his brother (who did not live long), his ambition \nto increase his possessions involved him in a war with the French \nKing, Louis, with whom he had been on such friendly terms just \nbefore, that to the French King\'s infant daughter, then a baby in \nthe cradle, he had promised one of his little sons in marriage, who \nwas a child of five years old.  However, the war came to nothing at \nlast, and the Pope made the two Kings friends again.\n\nNow, the clergy, in the troubles of the last reign, had gone on \nvery ill indeed.  There were all kinds of criminals among them - \nmurderers, thieves, and vagabonds; and the worst of the matter was, \nthat the good priests would not give up the bad priests to justice, \nwhen they committed crimes, but persisted in sheltering and \ndefending them.  The King, well knowing that there could be no \npeace or rest in England while such things lasted, resolved to \nreduce the power of the clergy; and, when he had reigned seven \nyears, found (as he considered) a good opportunity for doing so, in \nthe death of the Archbishop of Canterbury.  \'I will have for the \nnew Archbishop,\' thought the King, \'a friend in whom I can trust, \nwho will help me to humble these rebellious priests, and to have \nthem dealt with, when they do wrong, as other men who do wrong are \ndealt with.\'  So, he resolved to make his favourite, the new \nArchbishop; and this favourite was so extraordinary a man, and his \nstory is so curious, that I must tell you all about him.\n\nOnce upon a time, a worthy merchant of London, named GILBERT A \nBECKET, made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and was taken prisoner \nby a Saracen lord.  This lord, who treated him kindly and not like \na slave, had one fair daughter, who fell in love with the merchant; \nand who told him that she wanted to become a Christian, and was \nwilling to marry him if they could fly to a Christian country.  The \nmerchant returned her love, until he found an opportunity to \nescape, when he did not trouble himself about the Saracen lady, but \nescaped with his servant Richard, who had been taken prisoner along \nwith him, and arrived in England and forgot her.  The Saracen lady, \nwho was more loving than the merchant, left her father\'s house in \ndisguise to follow him, and made her way, under many hardships, to \nthe sea-shore.  The merchant had taught her only two English words \n(for I suppose he must have learnt the Saracen tongue himself, and \nmade love in that language), of which LONDON was one, and his own \nname, GILBERT, the other.  She went among the ships, saying, \n\'London! London!\' over and over again, until the sailors understood \nthat she wanted to find an English vessel that would carry her \nthere; so they showed her such a ship, and she paid for her passage \nwith some of her jewels, and sailed away.  Well!  The merchant was \nsitting in his counting-house in London one day, when he heard a \ngreat noise in the street; and presently Richard came running in \nfrom the warehouse, with his eyes wide open and his breath almost \ngone, saying, \'Master, master, here is the Saracen lady!\'  The \nmerchant thought Richard was mad; but Richard said, \'No, master!  \nAs I live, the Saracen lady is going up and down the city, calling \nGilbert!  Gilbert!\'  Then, he took the merchant by the sleeve, and \npointed out of window; and there they saw her among the gables and \nwater-spouts of the dark, dirty street, in her foreign dress, so \nforlorn, surrounded by a wondering crowd, and passing slowly along, \ncalling Gilbert, Gilbert!  When the merchant saw her, and thought \nof the tenderness she had shown him in his captivity, and of her \nconstancy, his heart was moved, and he ran down into the street; \nand she saw him coming, and with a great cry fainted in his arms.  \nThey were married without loss of time, and Richard (who was an \nexcellent man) danced with joy the whole day of the wedding; and \nthey all lived happy ever afterwards.\n\nThis merchant and this Saracen lady had one son, THOMAS A BECKET.  \nHe it was who became the Favourite of King Henry the Second.\n\nHe had become Chancellor, when the King thought of making him \nArchbishop.  He was clever, gay, well educated, brave; had fought \nin several battles in France; had defeated a French knight in \nsingle combat, and brought his horse away as a token of the \nvictory.  He lived in a noble palace, he was the tutor of the young \nPrince Henry, he was served by one hundred and forty knights, his \nriches were immense.  The King once sent him as his ambassador to \nFrance; and the French people, beholding in what state he \ntravelled, cried out in the streets, \'How splendid must the King of \nEngland be, when this is only the Chancellor!\'  They had good \nreason to wonder at the magnificence of Thomas a Becket, for, when \nhe entered a French town, his procession was headed by two hundred \nand fifty singing boys; then, came his hounds in couples; then, \neight waggons, each drawn by five horses driven by five drivers:  \ntwo of the waggons filled with strong ale to be given away to the \npeople; four, with his gold and silver plate and stately clothes; \ntwo, with the dresses of his numerous servants.  Then, came twelve \nhorses, each with a monkey on his back; then, a train of people \nbearing shields and leading fine war-horses splendidly equipped; \nthen, falconers with hawks upon their wrists; then, a host of \nknights, and gentlemen and priests; then, the Chancellor with his \nbrilliant garments flashing in the sun, and all the people capering \nand shouting with delight.\n\nThe King was well pleased with all this, thinking that it only made \nhimself the more magnificent to have so magnificent a favourite; \nbut he sometimes jested with the Chancellor upon his splendour too.  \nOnce, when they were riding together through the streets of London \nin hard winter weather, they saw a shivering old man in rags.  \n\'Look at the poor object!\' said the King.  \'Would it not be a \ncharitable act to give that aged man a comfortable warm cloak?\'  \n\'Undoubtedly it would,\' said Thomas a Becket, \'and you do well, \nSir, to think of such Christian duties.\'  \'Come!\' cried the King, \n\'then give him your cloak!\'  It was made of rich crimson trimmed \nwith ermine.  The King tried to pull it off, the Chancellor tried \nto keep it on, both were near rolling from their saddles in the \nmud, when the Chancellor submitted, and the King gave the cloak to \nthe old beggar:  much to the beggar\'s astonishment, and much to the \nmerriment of all the courtiers in attendance.  For, courtiers are \nnot only eager to laugh when the King laughs, but they really do \nenjoy a laugh against a Favourite.\n\n\'I will make,\' thought King Henry the second, \'this Chancellor of \nmine, Thomas a Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury.  He will then be \nthe head of the Church, and, being devoted to me, will help me to \ncorrect the Church.  He has always upheld my power against the \npower of the clergy, and once publicly told some bishops (I \nremember), that men of the Church were equally bound to me, with \nmen of the sword.  Thomas a Becket is the man, of all other men in \nEngland, to help me in my great design.\'  So the King, regardless \nof all objection, either that he was a fighting man, or a lavish \nman, or a courtly man, or a man of pleasure, or anything but a \nlikely man for the office, made him Archbishop accordingly.\n\nNow, Thomas a Becket was proud and loved to be famous.  He was \nalready famous for the pomp of his life, for his riches, his gold \nand silver plate, his waggons, horses, and attendants.  He could do \nno more in that way than he had done; and being tired of that kind \nof fame (which is a very poor one), he longed to have his name \ncelebrated for something else.  Nothing, he knew, would render him \nso famous in the world, as the setting of his utmost power and \nability against the utmost power and ability of the King.  He \nresolved with the whole strength of his mind to do it.\n\nHe may have had some secret grudge against the King besides.  The \nKing may have offended his proud humour at some time or other, for \nanything I know.  I think it likely, because it is a common thing \nfor Kings, Princes, and other great people, to try the tempers of \ntheir favourites rather severely.  Even the little affair of the \ncrimson cloak must have been anything but a pleasant one to a \nhaughty man.  Thomas a Becket knew better than any one in England \nwhat the King expected of him.  In all his sumptuous life, he had \nnever yet been in a position to disappoint the King.  He could take \nup that proud stand now, as head of the Church; and he determined \nthat it should be written in history, either that he subdued the \nKing, or that the King subdued him.\n\nSo, of a sudden, he completely altered the whole manner of his \nlife.  He turned off all his brilliant followers, ate coarse food, \ndrank bitter water, wore next his skin sackcloth covered with dirt \nand vermin (for it was then thought very religious to be very \ndirty), flogged his back to punish himself, lived chiefly in a \nlittle cell, washed the feet of thirteen poor people every day, and \nlooked as miserable as he possibly could.  If he had put twelve \nhundred monkeys on horseback instead of twelve, and had gone in \nprocession with eight thousand waggons instead of eight, he could \nnot have half astonished the people so much as by this great \nchange.  It soon caused him to be more talked about as an \nArchbishop than he had been as a Chancellor.\n\nThe King was very angry; and was made still more so, when the new \nArchbishop, claiming various estates from the nobles as being \nrightfully Church property, required the King himself, for the same \nreason, to give up Rochester Castle, and Rochester City too.  Not \nsatisfied with this, he declared that no power but himself should \nappoint a priest to any Church in the part of England over which he \nwas Archbishop; and when a certain gentleman of Kent made such an \nappointment, as he claimed to have the right to do, Thomas a Becket \nexcommunicated him.\n\nExcommunication was, next to the Interdict I told you of at the \nclose of the last chapter, the great weapon of the clergy.  It \nconsisted in declaring the person who was excommunicated, an \noutcast from the Church and from all religious offices; and in \ncursing him all over, from the top of his head to the sole of his \nfoot, whether he was standing up, lying down, sitting, kneeling, \nwalking, running, hopping, jumping, gaping, coughing, sneezing, or \nwhatever else he was doing.  This unchristian nonsense would of \ncourse have made no sort of difference to the person cursed - who \ncould say his prayers at home if he were shut out of church, and \nwhom none but GOD could judge - but for the fears and superstitions \nof the people, who avoided excommunicated persons, and made their \nlives unhappy.  So, the King said to the New Archbishop, \'Take off \nthis Excommunication from this gentleman of Kent.\'  To which the \nArchbishop replied, \'I shall do no such thing.\'\n\nThe quarrel went on.  A priest in Worcestershire committed a most \ndreadful murder, that aroused the horror of the whole nation.  The \nKing demanded to have this wretch delivered up, to be tried in the \nsame court and in the same way as any other murderer.  The \nArchbishop refused, and kept him in the Bishop\'s prison.  The King, \nholding a solemn assembly in Westminster Hall, demanded that in \nfuture all priests found guilty before their Bishops of crimes \nagainst the law of the land should be considered priests no longer, \nand should be delivered over to the law of the land for punishment.  \nThe Archbishop again refused.  The King required to know whether \nthe clergy would obey the ancient customs of the country?  Every \npriest there, but one, said, after Thomas a Becket, \'Saving my \norder.\'  This really meant that they would only obey those customs \nwhen they did not interfere with their own claims; and the King \nwent out of the Hall in great wrath.\n\nSome of the clergy began to be afraid, now, that they were going \ntoo far.  Though Thomas a Becket was otherwise as unmoved as \nWestminster Hall, they prevailed upon him, for the sake of their \nfears, to go to the King at Woodstock, and promise to observe the \nancient customs of the country, without saying anything about his \norder.  The King received this submission favourably, and summoned \na great council of the clergy to meet at the Castle of Clarendon, \nby Salisbury.  But when the council met, the Archbishop again \ninsisted on the words \'saying my order;\' and he still insisted, \nthough lords entreated him, and priests wept before him and knelt \nto him, and an adjoining room was thrown open, filled with armed \nsoldiers of the King, to threaten him.  At length he gave way, for \nthat time, and the ancient customs (which included what the King \nhad demanded in vain) were stated in writing, and were signed and \nsealed by the chief of the clergy, and were called the \nConstitutions of Clarendon.\n\nThe quarrel went on, for all that.  The Archbishop tried to see the \nKing.  The King would not see him.  The Archbishop tried to escape \nfrom England.  The sailors on the coast would launch no boat to \ntake him away.  Then, he again resolved to do his worst in \nopposition to the King, and began openly to set the ancient customs \nat defiance.\n\nThe King summoned him before a great council at Northampton, where \nhe accused him of high treason, and made a claim against him, which \nwas not a just one, for an enormous sum of money.  Thomas a Becket \nwas alone against the whole assembly, and the very Bishops advised \nhim to resign his office and abandon his contest with the King.  \nHis great anxiety and agitation stretched him on a sick-bed for two \ndays, but he was still undaunted.  He went to the adjourned \ncouncil, carrying a great cross in his right hand, and sat down \nholding it erect before him.  The King angrily retired into an \ninner room.  The whole assembly angrily retired and left him there.  \nBut there he sat.  The Bishops came out again in a body, and \nrenounced him as a traitor.  He only said, \'I hear!\' and sat there \nstill.  They retired again into the inner room, and his trial \nproceeded without him.  By-and-by, the Earl of Leicester, heading \nthe barons, came out to read his sentence.  He refused to hear it, \ndenied the power of the court, and said he would refer his cause to \nthe Pope.  As he walked out of the hall, with the cross in his \nhand, some of those present picked up rushes - rushes were strewn \nupon the floors in those days by way of carpet - and threw them at \nhim.  He proudly turned his head, and said that were he not \nArchbishop, he would chastise those cowards with the sword he had \nknown how to use in bygone days.  He then mounted his horse, and \nrode away, cheered and surrounded by the common people, to whom he \nthrew open his house that night and gave a supper, supping with \nthem himself.  That same night he secretly departed from the town; \nand so, travelling by night and hiding by day, and calling himself \n\'Brother Dearman,\' got away, not without difficulty, to Flanders.\n\nThe struggle still went on.  The angry King took possession of the \nrevenues of the archbishopric, and banished all the relations and \nservants of Thomas a Becket, to the number of four hundred.  The \nPope and the French King both protected him, and an abbey was \nassigned for his residence.  Stimulated by this support, Thomas a \nBecket, on a great festival day, formally proceeded to a great \nchurch crowded with people, and going up into the pulpit publicly \ncursed and excommunicated all who had supported the Constitutions \nof Clarendon:  mentioning many English noblemen by name, and not \ndistantly hinting at the King of England himself.\n\nWhen intelligence of this new affront was carried to the King in \nhis chamber, his passion was so furious that he tore his clothes, \nand rolled like a madman on his bed of straw and rushes.  But he \nwas soon up and doing.  He ordered all the ports and coasts of \nEngland to be narrowly watched, that no letters of Interdict might \nbe brought into the kingdom; and sent messengers and bribes to the \nPope\'s palace at Rome.  Meanwhile, Thomas a Becket, for his part, \nwas not idle at Rome, but constantly employed his utmost arts in \nhis own behalf.  Thus the contest stood, until there was peace \nbetween France and England (which had been for some time at war), \nand until the two children of the two Kings were married in \ncelebration of it.  Then, the French King brought about a meeting \nbetween Henry and his old favourite, so long his enemy.\n\nEven then, though Thomas a Becket knelt before the King, he was \nobstinate and immovable as to those words about his order.  King \nLouis of France was weak enough in his veneration for Thomas a \nBecket and such men, but this was a little too much for him.  He \nsaid that a Becket \'wanted to be greater than the saints and better \nthan St. Peter,\' and rode away from him with the King of England.  \nHis poor French Majesty asked a Becket\'s pardon for so doing, \nhowever, soon afterwards, and cut a very pitiful figure.\n\nAt last, and after a world of trouble, it came to this.  There was \nanother meeting on French ground between King Henry and Thomas a \nBecket, and it was agreed that Thomas a Becket should be Archbishop \nof Canterbury, according to the customs of former Archbishops, and \nthat the King should put him in possession of the revenues of that \npost.  And now, indeed, you might suppose the struggle at an end, \nand Thomas a Becket at rest.  NO, not even yet.  For Thomas a \nBecket hearing, by some means, that King Henry, when he was in \ndread of his kingdom being placed under an interdict, had had his \neldest son Prince Henry secretly crowned, not only persuaded the \nPope to suspend the Archbishop of York who had performed that \nceremony, and to excommunicate the Bishops who had assisted at it, \nbut sent a messenger of his own into England, in spite of all the \nKing\'s precautions along the coast, who delivered the letters of \nexcommunication into the Bishops\' own hands.  Thomas a Becket then \ncame over to England himself, after an absence of seven years.  He \nwas privately warned that it was dangerous to come, and that an \nireful knight, named RANULF DE BROC, had threatened that he should \nnot live to eat a loaf of bread in England; but he came.\n\nThe common people received him well, and marched about with him in \na soldierly way, armed with such rustic weapons as they could get.  \nHe tried to see the young prince who had once been his pupil, but \nwas prevented.  He hoped for some little support among the nobles \nand priests, but found none.  He made the most of the peasants who \nattended him, and feasted them, and went from Canterbury to Harrow-\non-the-Hill, and from Harrow-on-the-Hill back to Canterbury, and on \nChristmas Day preached in the Cathedral there, and told the people \nin his sermon that he had come to die among them, and that it was \nlikely he would be murdered.  He had no fear, however - or, if he \nhad any, he had much more obstinacy - for he, then and there, \nexcommunicated three of his enemies, of whom Ranulf de Broc, the \nireful knight, was one.\n\nAs men in general had no fancy for being cursed, in their sitting \nand walking, and gaping and sneezing, and all the rest of it, it \nwas very natural in the persons so freely excommunicated to \ncomplain to the King.  It was equally natural in the King, who had \nhoped that this troublesome opponent was at last quieted, to fall \ninto a mighty rage when he heard of these new affronts; and, on the \nArchbishop of York telling him that he never could hope for rest \nwhile Thomas a Becket lived, to cry out hastily before his court, \n\'Have I no one here who will deliver me from this man?\'  There were \nfour knights present, who, hearing the King\'s words, looked at one \nanother, and went out.\n\nThe names of these knights were REGINALD FITZURSE, WILLIAM TRACY, \nHUGH DE MORVILLE, and RICHARD BRITO; three of whom had been in the \ntrain of Thomas a Becket in the old days of his splendour.  They \nrode away on horseback, in a very secret manner, and on the third \nday after Christmas Day arrived at Saltwood House, not far from \nCanterbury, which belonged to the family of Ranulf de Broc.  They \nquietly collected some followers here, in case they should need \nany; and proceeding to Canterbury, suddenly appeared (the four \nknights and twelve men) before the Archbishop, in his own house, at \ntwo o\'clock in the afternoon.  They neither bowed nor spoke, but \nsat down on the floor in silence, staring at the Archbishop.\n\nThomas a Becket said, at length, \'What do you want?\'\n\n\'We want,\' said Reginald Fitzurse, \'the excommunication taken from \nthe Bishops, and you to answer for your offences to the King.\'  \nThomas a Becket defiantly replied, that the power of the clergy was \nabove the power of the King.  That it was not for such men as they \nwere, to threaten him.  That if he were threatened by all the \nswords in England, he would never yield.\n\n\'Then we will do more than threaten!\' said the knights.  And they \nwent out with the twelve men, and put on their armour, and drew \ntheir shining swords, and came back.\n\nHis servants, in the meantime, had shut up and barred the great \ngate of the palace.  At first, the knights tried to shatter it with \ntheir battle-axes; but, being shown a window by which they could \nenter, they let the gate alone, and climbed in that way.  While \nthey were battering at the door, the attendants of Thomas a Becket \nhad implored him to take refuge in the Cathedral; in which, as a \nsanctuary or sacred place, they thought the knights would dare to \ndo no violent deed.  He told them, again and again, that he would \nnot stir.  Hearing the distant voices of the monks singing the \nevening service, however, he said it was now his duty to attend, \nand therefore, and for no other reason, he would go.\n\nThere was a near way between his Palace and the Cathedral, by some \nbeautiful old cloisters which you may yet see.  He went into the \nCathedral, without any hurry, and having the Cross carried before \nhim as usual.  When he was safely there, his servants would have \nfastened the door, but he said NO! it was the house of God and not \na fortress.\n\nAs he spoke, the shadow of Reginald Fitzurse appeared in the \nCathedral doorway, darkening the little light there was outside, on \nthe dark winter evening.  This knight said, in a strong voice, \n\'Follow me, loyal servants of the King!\'  The rattle of the armour \nof the other knights echoed through the Cathedral, as they came \nclashing in.\n\nIt was so dark, in the lofty aisles and among the stately pillars \nof the church, and there were so many hiding-places in the crypt \nbelow and in the narrow passages above, that Thomas a Becket might \neven at that pass have saved himself if he would.  But he would \nnot.  He told the monks resolutely that he would not.  And though \nthey all dispersed and left him there with no other follower than \nEDWARD GRYME, his faithful cross-bearer, he was as firm then, as \never he had been in his life.\n\nThe knights came on, through the darkness, making a terrible noise \nwith their armed tread upon the stone pavement of the church.  \n\'Where is the traitor?\' they cried out.  He made no answer.  But \nwhen they cried, \'Where is the Archbishop?\' he said proudly, \'I am \nhere!\' and came out of the shade and stood before them.\n\nThe knights had no desire to kill him, if they could rid the King \nand themselves of him by any other means.  They told him he must \neither fly or go with them.  He said he would do neither; and he \nthrew William Tracy off with such force when he took hold of his \nsleeve, that Tracy reeled again.  By his reproaches and his \nsteadiness, he so incensed them, and exasperated their fierce \nhumour, that Reginald Fitzurse, whom he called by an ill name, \nsaid, \'Then die!\' and struck at his head.  But the faithful Edward \nGryme put out his arm, and there received the main force of the \nblow, so that it only made his master bleed.  Another voice from \namong the knights again called to Thomas a Becket to fly; but, with \nhis blood running down his face, and his hands clasped, and his \nhead bent, he commanded himself to God, and stood firm.  Then they \ncruelly killed him close to the altar of St. Bennet; and his body \nfell upon the pavement, which was dirtied with his blood and \nbrains.\n\nIt is an awful thing to think of the murdered mortal, who had so \nshowered his curses about, lying, all disfigured, in the church, \nwhere a few lamps here and there were but red specks on a pall of \ndarkness; and to think of the guilty knights riding away on \nhorseback, looking over their shoulders at the dim Cathedral, and \nremembering what they had left inside.\n\n\nPART THE SECOND\n\n\nWHEN the King heard how Thomas a Becket had lost his life in \nCanterbury Cathedral, through the ferocity of the four Knights, he \nwas filled with dismay.  Some have supposed that when the King \nspoke those hasty words, \'Have I no one here who will deliver me \nfrom this man?\' he wished, and meant a Becket to be slain.  But few \nthings are more unlikely; for, besides that the King was not \nnaturally cruel (though very passionate), he was wise, and must \nhave known full well what any stupid man in his dominions must have \nknown, namely, that such a murder would rouse the Pope and the \nwhole Church against him.\n\nHe sent respectful messengers to the Pope, to represent his \ninnocence (except in having uttered the hasty words); and he swore \nsolemnly and publicly to his innocence, and contrived in time to \nmake his peace.  As to the four guilty Knights, who fled into \nYorkshire, and never again dared to show themselves at Court, the \nPope excommunicated them; and they lived miserably for some time, \nshunned by all their countrymen.  At last, they went humbly to \nJerusalem as a penance, and there died and were buried.\n\nIt happened, fortunately for the pacifying of the Pope, that an \nopportunity arose very soon after the murder of a Becket, for the \nKing to declare his power in Ireland - which was an acceptable \nundertaking to the Pope, as the Irish, who had been converted to \nChristianity by one Patricius (otherwise Saint Patrick) long ago, \nbefore any Pope existed, considered that the Pope had nothing at \nall to do with them, or they with the Pope, and accordingly refused \nto pay him Peter\'s Pence, or that tax of a penny a house which I \nhave elsewhere mentioned.  The King\'s opportunity arose in this \nway.\n\nThe Irish were, at that time, as barbarous a people as you can well \nimagine.  They were continually quarrelling and fighting, cutting \none another\'s throats, slicing one another\'s noses, burning one \nanother\'s houses, carrying away one another\'s wives, and committing \nall sorts of violence.  The country was divided into five kingdoms \n- DESMOND, THOMOND, CONNAUGHT, ULSTER, and LEINSTER - each governed \nby a separate King, of whom one claimed to be the chief of the \nrest.  Now, one of these Kings, named DERMOND MAC MURROUGH (a wild \nkind of name, spelt in more than one wild kind of way), had carried \noff the wife of a friend of his, and concealed her on an island in \na bog.  The friend resenting this (though it was quite the custom \nof the country), complained to the chief King, and, with the chief \nKing\'s help, drove Dermond Mac Murrough out of his dominions.  \nDermond came over to England for revenge; and offered to hold his \nrealm as a vassal of King Henry, if King Henry would help him to \nregain it.  The King consented to these terms; but only assisted \nhim, then, with what were called Letters Patent, authorising any \nEnglish subjects who were so disposed, to enter into his service, \nand aid his cause.\n\nThere was, at Bristol, a certain EARL RICHARD DE CLARE, called \nSTRONGBOW; of no very good character; needy and desperate, and \nready for anything that offered him a chance of improving his \nfortunes.  There were, in South Wales, two other broken knights of \nthe same good-for-nothing sort, called ROBERT FITZ-STEPHEN, and \nMAURICE FITZ-GERALD.  These three, each with a small band of \nfollowers, took up Dermond\'s cause; and it was agreed that if it \nproved successful, Strongbow should marry Dermond\'s daughter EVA, \nand be declared his heir.\n\nThe trained English followers of these knights were so superior in \nall the discipline of battle to the Irish, that they beat them \nagainst immense superiority of numbers.  In one fight, early in the \nwar, they cut off three hundred heads, and laid them before Mac \nMurrough; who turned them every one up with his hands, rejoicing, \nand, coming to one which was the head of a man whom he had much \ndisliked, grasped it by the hair and ears, and tore off the nose \nand lips with his teeth.  You may judge from this, what kind of a \ngentleman an Irish King in those times was.  The captives, all \nthrough this war, were horribly treated; the victorious party \nmaking nothing of breaking their limbs, and casting them into the \nsea from the tops of high rocks.  It was in the midst of the \nmiseries and cruelties attendant on the taking of Waterford, where \nthe dead lay piled in the streets, and the filthy gutters ran with \nblood, that Strongbow married Eva.  An odious marriage-company \nthose mounds of corpse\'s must have made, I think, and one quite \nworthy of the young lady\'s father.\n\nHe died, after Waterford and Dublin had been taken, and various \nsuccesses achieved; and Strongbow became King of Leinster.  Now \ncame King Henry\'s opportunity.  To restrain the growing power of \nStrongbow, he himself repaired to Dublin, as Strongbow\'s Royal \nMaster, and deprived him of his kingdom, but confirmed him in the \nenjoyment of great possessions.  The King, then, holding state in \nDublin, received the homage of nearly all the Irish Kings and \nChiefs, and so came home again with a great addition to his \nreputation as Lord of Ireland, and with a new claim on the favour \nof the Pope.  And now, their reconciliation was completed - more \neasily and mildly by the Pope, than the King might have expected, I \nthink.\n\nAt this period of his reign, when his troubles seemed so few and \nhis prospects so bright, those domestic miseries began which \ngradually made the King the most unhappy of men, reduced his great \nspirit, wore away his health, and broke his heart.\n\nHe had four sons.  HENRY, now aged eighteen - his secret crowning \nof whom had given such offence to Thomas a Becket.  RICHARD, aged \nsixteen; GEOFFREY, fifteen; and JOHN, his favourite, a young boy \nwhom the courtiers named LACKLAND, because he had no inheritance, \nbut to whom the King meant to give the Lordship of Ireland.  All \nthese misguided boys, in their turn, were unnatural sons to him, \nand unnatural brothers to each other.  Prince Henry, stimulated by \nthe French King, and by his bad mother, Queen Eleanor, began the \nundutiful history,\n\nFirst, he demanded that his young wife, MARGARET, the French King\'s \ndaughter, should be crowned as well as he.  His father, the King, \nconsented, and it was done.  It was no sooner done, than he \ndemanded to have a part of his father\'s dominions, during his \nfather\'s life.  This being refused, he made off from his father in \nthe night, with his bad heart full of bitterness, and took refuge \nat the French King\'s Court.  Within a day or two, his brothers \nRichard and Geoffrey followed.  Their mother tried to join them - \nescaping in man\'s clothes - but she was seized by King Henry\'s men, \nand immured in prison, where she lay, deservedly, for sixteen \nyears.  Every day, however, some grasping English noblemen, to whom \nthe King\'s protection of his people from their avarice and \noppression had given offence, deserted him and joined the Princes.  \nEvery day he heard some fresh intelligence of the Princes levying \narmies against him; of Prince Henry\'s wearing a crown before his \nown ambassadors at the French Court, and being called the Junior \nKing of England; of all the Princes swearing never to make peace \nwith him, their father, without the consent and approval of the \nBarons of France.  But, with his fortitude and energy unshaken, \nKing Henry met the shock of these disasters with a resolved and \ncheerful face.  He called upon all Royal fathers who had sons, to \nhelp him, for his cause was theirs; he hired, out of his riches, \ntwenty thousand men to fight the false French King, who stirred his \nown blood against him; and he carried on the war with such vigour, \nthat Louis soon proposed a conference to treat for peace.\n\nThe conference was held beneath an old wide-spreading green elm-\ntree, upon a plain in France.  It led to nothing.  The war \nrecommenced.  Prince Richard began his fighting career, by leading \nan army against his father; but his father beat him and his army \nback; and thousands of his men would have rued the day in which \nthey fought in such a wicked cause, had not the King received news \nof an invasion of England by the Scots, and promptly come home \nthrough a great storm to repress it.  And whether he really began \nto fear that he suffered these troubles because a Becket had been \nmurdered; or whether he wished to rise in the favour of the Pope, \nwho had now declared a Becket to be a saint, or in the favour of \nhis own people, of whom many believed that even a Becket\'s \nsenseless tomb could work miracles, I don\'t know:  but the King no \nsooner landed in England than he went straight to Canterbury; and \nwhen he came within sight of the distant Cathedral, he dismounted \nfrom his horse, took off his shoes, and walked with bare and \nbleeding feet to a Becket\'s grave.  There, he lay down on the \nground, lamenting, in the presence of many people; and by-and-by he \nwent into the Chapter House, and, removing his clothes from his \nback and shoulders, submitted himself to be beaten with knotted \ncords (not beaten very hard, I dare say though) by eighty Priests, \none after another.  It chanced that on the very day when the King \nmade this curious exhibition of himself, a complete victory was \nobtained over the Scots; which very much delighted the Priests, who \nsaid that it was won because of his great example of repentance.  \nFor the Priests in general had found out, since a Becket\'s death, \nthat they admired him of all things - though they had hated him \nvery cordially when he was alive.\n\nThe Earl of Flanders, who was at the head of the base conspiracy of \nthe King\'s undutiful sons and their foreign friends, took the \nopportunity of the King being thus employed at home, to lay siege \nto Rouen, the capital of Normandy.  But the King, who was \nextraordinarily quick and active in all his movements, was at \nRouen, too, before it was supposed possible that he could have left \nEngland; and there he so defeated the said Earl of Flanders, that \nthe conspirators proposed peace, and his bad sons Henry and \nGeoffrey submitted.  Richard resisted for six weeks; but, being \nbeaten out of castle after castle, he at last submitted too, and \nhis father forgave him.\n\nTo forgive these unworthy princes was only to afford them \nbreathing-time for new faithlessness.  They were so false, \ndisloyal, and dishonourable, that they were no more to be trusted \nthan common thieves.  In the very next year, Prince Henry rebelled \nagain, and was again forgiven.  In eight years more, Prince Richard \nrebelled against his elder brother; and Prince Geoffrey infamously \nsaid that the brothers could never agree well together, unless they \nwere united against their father.  In the very next year after \ntheir reconciliation by the King, Prince Henry again rebelled \nagainst his father; and again submitted, swearing to be true; and \nwas again forgiven; and again rebelled with Geoffrey.\n\nBut the end of this perfidious Prince was come.  He fell sick at a \nFrench town; and his conscience terribly reproaching him with his \nbaseness, he sent messengers to the King his father, imploring him \nto come and see him, and to forgive him for the last time on his \nbed of death.  The generous King, who had a royal and forgiving \nmind towards his children always, would have gone; but this Prince \nhad been so unnatural, that the noblemen about the King suspected \ntreachery, and represented to him that he could not safely trust \nhis life with such a traitor, though his own eldest son.  Therefore \nthe King sent him a ring from off his finger as a token of \nforgiveness; and when the Prince had kissed it, with much grief and \nmany tears, and had confessed to those around him how bad, and \nwicked, and undutiful a son he had been; he said to the attendant \nPriests:  \'O, tie a rope about my body, and draw me out of bed, and \nlay me down upon a bed of ashes, that I may die with prayers to God \nin a repentant manner!\'  And so he died, at twenty-seven years old.\n\nThree years afterwards, Prince Geoffrey, being unhorsed at a \ntournament, had his brains trampled out by a crowd of horses \npassing over him.  So, there only remained Prince Richard, and \nPrince John - who had grown to be a young man now, and had solemnly \nsworn to be faithful to his father.  Richard soon rebelled again, \nencouraged by his friend the French King, PHILIP THE SECOND (son of \nLouis, who was dead); and soon submitted and was again forgiven, \nswearing on the New Testament never to rebel again; and in another \nyear or so, rebelled again; and, in the presence of his father, \nknelt down on his knee before the King of France; and did the \nFrench King homage:  and declared that with his aid he would \npossess himself, by force, of all his father\'s French dominions.\n\nAnd yet this Richard called himself a soldier of Our Saviour!  And \nyet this Richard wore the Cross, which the Kings of France and \nEngland had both taken, in the previous year, at a brotherly \nmeeting underneath the old wide-spreading elm-tree on the plain, \nwhen they had sworn (like him) to devote themselves to a new \nCrusade, for the love and honour of the Truth!\n\nSick at heart, wearied out by the falsehood of his sons, and almost \nready to lie down and die, the unhappy King who had so long stood \nfirm, began to fail.  But the Pope, to his honour, supported him; \nand obliged the French King and Richard, though successful in \nfight, to treat for peace.  Richard wanted to be Crowned King of \nEngland, and pretended that he wanted to be married (which he \nreally did not) to the French King\'s sister, his promised wife, \nwhom King Henry detained in England.  King Henry wanted, on the \nother hand, that the French King\'s sister should be married to his \nfavourite son, John:  the only one of his sons (he said) who had \nnever rebelled against him.  At last King Henry, deserted by his \nnobles one by one, distressed, exhausted, broken-hearted, consented \nto establish peace.\n\nOne final heavy sorrow was reserved for him, even yet.  When they \nbrought him the proposed treaty of peace, in writing, as he lay \nvery ill in bed, they brought him also the list of the deserters \nfrom their allegiance, whom he was required to pardon.  The first \nname upon this list was John, his favourite son, in whom he had \ntrusted to the last.\n\n\'O John! child of my heart!\' exclaimed the King, in a great agony \nof mind.  \'O John, whom I have loved the best!  O John, for whom I \nhave contended through these many troubles!  Have you betrayed me \ntoo!\'  And then he lay down with a heavy groan, and said, \'Now let \nthe world go as it will.  I care for nothing more!\'\n\nAfter a time, he told his attendants to take him to the French town \nof Chinon - a town he had been fond of, during many years.  But he \nwas fond of no place now; it was too true that he could care for \nnothing more upon this earth.  He wildly cursed the hour when he \nwas born, and cursed the children whom he left behind him; and \nexpired.\n\nAs, one hundred years before, the servile followers of the Court \nhad abandoned the Conqueror in the hour of his death, so they now \nabandoned his descendant.  The very body was stripped, in the \nplunder of the Royal chamber; and it was not easy to find the means \nof carrying it for burial to the abbey church of Fontevraud.\n\nRichard was said in after years, by way of flattery, to have the \nheart of a Lion.  It would have been far better, I think, to have \nhad the heart of a Man.  His heart, whatever it was, had cause to \nbeat remorsefully within his breast, when he came - as he did - \ninto the solemn abbey, and looked on his dead father\'s uncovered \nface.  His heart, whatever it was, had been a black and perjured \nheart, in all its dealings with the deceased King, and more \ndeficient in a single touch of tenderness than any wild beast\'s in \nthe forest.\n\nThere is a pretty story told of this Reign, called the story of \nFAIR ROSAMOND.  It relates how the King doted on Fair Rosamond, who \nwas the loveliest girl in all the world; and how he had a beautiful \nBower built for her in a Park at Woodstock; and how it was erected \nin a labyrinth, and could only be found by a clue of silk.  How the \nbad Queen Eleanor, becoming jealous of Fair Rosamond, found out the \nsecret of the clue, and one day, appeared before her, with a dagger \nand a cup of poison, and left her to the choice between those \ndeaths.  How Fair Rosamond, after shedding many piteous tears and \noffering many useless prayers to the cruel Queen, took the poison, \nand fell dead in the midst of the beautiful bower, while the \nunconscious birds sang gaily all around her.\n\nNow, there WAS a fair Rosamond, and she was (I dare say) the \nloveliest girl in all the world, and the King was certainly very \nfond of her, and the bad Queen Eleanor was certainly made jealous.  \nBut I am afraid - I say afraid, because I like the story so much - \nthat there was no bower, no labyrinth, no silken clue, no dagger, \nno poison.  I am afraid fair Rosamond retired to a nunnery near \nOxford, and died there, peaceably; her sister-nuns hanging a silken \ndrapery over her tomb, and often dressing it with flowers, in \nremembrance of the youth and beauty that had enchanted the King \nwhen he too was young, and when his life lay fair before him.\n\nIt was dark and ended now; faded and gone.  Henry Plantagenet lay \nquiet in the abbey church of Fontevraud, in the fifty-seventh year \nof his age - never to be completed - after governing England well, \nfor nearly thirty-five years.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII - ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE FIRST, CALLED THE LION-\nHEART\n\n\n\nIN the year of our Lord one thousand one hundred and eighty-nine, \nRichard of the Lion Heart succeeded to the throne of King Henry the \nSecond, whose paternal heart he had done so much to break.  He had \nbeen, as we have seen, a rebel from his boyhood; but, the moment he \nbecame a king against whom others might rebel, he found out that \nrebellion was a great wickedness.  In the heat of this pious \ndiscovery, he punished all the leading people who had befriended \nhim against his father.  He could scarcely have done anything that \nwould have been a better instance of his real nature, or a better \nwarning to fawners and parasites not to trust in lion-hearted \nprinces.\n\nHe likewise put his late father\'s treasurer in chains, and locked \nhim up in a dungeon from which he was not set free until he had \nrelinquished, not only all the Crown treasure, but all his own \nmoney too.  So, Richard certainly got the Lion\'s share of the \nwealth of this wretched treasurer, whether he had a Lion\'s heart or \nnot.\n\nHe was crowned King of England, with great pomp, at Westminster:  \nwalking to the Cathedral under a silken canopy stretched on the \ntops of four lances, each carried by a great lord.  On the day of \nhis coronation, a dreadful murdering of the Jews took place, which \nseems to have given great delight to numbers of savage persons \ncalling themselves Christians.  The King had issued a proclamation \nforbidding the Jews (who were generally hated, though they were the \nmost useful merchants in England) to appear at the ceremony; but as \nthey had assembled in London from all parts, bringing presents to \nshow their respect for the new Sovereign, some of them ventured \ndown to Westminster Hall with their gifts; which were very readily \naccepted.  It is supposed, now, that some noisy fellow in the \ncrowd, pretending to be a very delicate Christian, set up a howl at \nthis, and struck a Jew who was trying to get in at the Hall door \nwith his present.  A riot arose.  The Jews who had got into the \nHall, were driven forth; and some of the rabble cried out that the \nnew King had commanded the unbelieving race to be put to death.  \nThereupon the crowd rushed through the narrow streets of the city, \nslaughtering all the Jews they met; and when they could find no \nmore out of doors (on account of their having fled to their houses, \nand fastened themselves in), they ran madly about, breaking open \nall the houses where the Jews lived, rushing in and stabbing or \nspearing them, sometimes even flinging old people and children out \nof window into blazing fires they had lighted up below.  This great \ncruelty lasted four-and-twenty hours, and only three men were \npunished for it.  Even they forfeited their lives not for murdering \nand robbing the Jews, but for burning the houses of some \nChristians.\n\nKing Richard, who was a strong, restless, burly man, with one idea \nalways in his head, and that the very troublesome idea of breaking \nthe heads of other men, was mightily impatient to go on a Crusade \nto the Holy Land, with a great army.  As great armies could not be \nraised to go, even to the Holy Land, without a great deal of money, \nhe sold the Crown domains, and even the high offices of State; \nrecklessly appointing noblemen to rule over his English subjects, \nnot because they were fit to govern, but because they could pay \nhigh for the privilege.  In this way, and by selling pardons at a \ndear rate and by varieties of avarice and oppression, he scraped \ntogether a large treasure.  He then appointed two Bishops to take \ncare of his kingdom in his absence, and gave great powers and \npossessions to his brother John, to secure his friendship.  John \nwould rather have been made Regent of England; but he was a sly \nman, and friendly to the expedition; saying to himself, no doubt, \n\'The more fighting, the more chance of my brother being killed; and \nwhen he IS killed, then I become King John!\'\n\nBefore the newly levied army departed from England, the recruits \nand the general populace distinguished themselves by astonishing \ncruelties on the unfortunate Jews:  whom, in many large towns, they \nmurdered by hundreds in the most horrible manner.\n\nAt York, a large body of Jews took refuge in the Castle, in the \nabsence of its Governor, after the wives and children of many of \nthem had been slain before their eyes.  Presently came the \nGovernor, and demanded admission.  \'How can we give it thee, O \nGovernor!\' said the Jews upon the walls, \'when, if we open the gate \nby so much as the width of a foot, the roaring crowd behind thee \nwill press in and kill us?\'\n\nUpon this, the unjust Governor became angry, and told the people \nthat he approved of their killing those Jews; and a mischievous \nmaniac of a friar, dressed all in white, put himself at the head of \nthe assault, and they assaulted the Castle for three days.\n\nThen said JOCEN, the head-Jew (who was a Rabbi or Priest), to the \nrest, \'Brethren, there is no hope for us with the Christians who \nare hammering at the gates and walls, and who must soon break in.  \nAs we and our wives and children must die, either by Christian \nhands, or by our own, let it be by our own.  Let us destroy by fire \nwhat jewels and other treasure we have here, then fire the castle, \nand then perish!\'\n\nA few could not resolve to do this, but the greater part complied.  \nThey made a blazing heap of all their valuables, and, when those \nwere consumed, set the castle in flames.  While the flames roared \nand crackled around them, and shooting up into the sky, turned it \nblood-red, Jocen cut the throat of his beloved wife, and stabbed \nhimself.  All the others who had wives or children, did the like \ndreadful deed.  When the populace broke in, they found (except the \ntrembling few, cowering in corners, whom they soon killed) only \nheaps of greasy cinders, with here and there something like part of \nthe blackened trunk of a burnt tree, but which had lately been a \nhuman creature, formed by the beneficent hand of the Creator as \nthey were.\n\nAfter this bad beginning, Richard and his troops went on, in no \nvery good manner, with the Holy Crusade.  It was undertaken jointly \nby the King of England and his old friend Philip of France.  They \ncommenced the business by reviewing their forces, to the number of \none hundred thousand men.  Afterwards, they severally embarked \ntheir troops for Messina, in Sicily, which was appointed as the \nnext place of meeting.\n\nKing Richard\'s sister had married the King of this place, but he \nwas dead:  and his uncle TANCRED had usurped the crown, cast the \nRoyal Widow into prison, and possessed himself of her estates.  \nRichard fiercely demanded his sister\'s release, the restoration of \nher lands, and (according to the Royal custom of the Island) that \nshe should have a golden chair, a golden table, four-and-twenty \nsilver cups, and four-and-twenty silver dishes.  As he was too \npowerful to be successfully resisted, Tancred yielded to his \ndemands; and then the French King grew jealous, and complained that \nthe English King wanted to be absolute in the Island of Messina and \neverywhere else.  Richard, however, cared little or nothing for \nthis complaint; and in consideration of a present of twenty \nthousand pieces of gold, promised his pretty little nephew ARTHUR, \nthen a child of two years old, in marriage to Tancred\'s daughter.  \nWe shall hear again of pretty little Arthur by-and-by.\n\nThis Sicilian affair arranged without anybody\'s brains being \nknocked out (which must have rather disappointed him), King Richard \ntook his sister away, and also a fair lady named BERENGARIA, with \nwhom he had fallen in love in France, and whom his mother, Queen \nEleanor (so long in prison, you remember, but released by Richard \non his coming to the Throne), had brought out there to be his wife; \nand sailed with them for Cyprus.\n\nHe soon had the pleasure of fighting the King of the Island of \nCyprus, for allowing his subjects to pillage some of the English \ntroops who were shipwrecked on the shore; and easily conquering \nthis poor monarch, he seized his only daughter, to be a companion \nto the lady Berengaria, and put the King himself into silver \nfetters.  He then sailed away again with his mother, sister, wife, \nand the captive princess; and soon arrived before the town of Acre, \nwhich the French King with his fleet was besieging from the sea.  \nBut the French King was in no triumphant condition, for his army \nhad been thinned by the swords of the Saracens, and wasted by the \nplague; and SALADIN, the brave Sultan of the Turks, at the head of \na numerous army, was at that time gallantly defending the place \nfrom the hills that rise above it.\n\nWherever the united army of Crusaders went, they agreed in few \npoints except in gaming, drinking, and quarrelling, in a most \nunholy manner; in debauching the people among whom they tarried, \nwhether they were friends or foes; and in carrying disturbance and \nruin into quiet places.  The French King was jealous of the English \nKing, and the English King was jealous of the French King, and the \ndisorderly and violent soldiers of the two nations were jealous of \none another; consequently, the two Kings could not at first agree, \neven upon a joint assault on Acre; but when they did make up their \nquarrel for that purpose, the Saracens promised to yield the town, \nto give up to the Christians the wood of the Holy Cross, to set at \nliberty all their Christian captives, and to pay two hundred \nthousand pieces of gold.  All this was to be done within forty \ndays; but, not being done, King Richard ordered some three thousand \nSaracen prisoners to be brought out in the front of his camp, and \nthere, in full view of their own countrymen, to be butchered.\n\nThe French King had no part in this crime; for he was by that time \ntravelling homeward with the greater part of his men; being \noffended by the overbearing conduct of the English King; being \nanxious to look after his own dominions; and being ill, besides, \nfrom the unwholesome air of that hot and sandy country.  King \nRichard carried on the war without him; and remained in the East, \nmeeting with a variety of adventures, nearly a year and a half.  \nEvery night when his army was on the march, and came to a halt, the \nheralds cried out three times, to remind all the soldiers of the \ncause in which they were engaged, \'Save the Holy Sepulchre!\' and \nthen all the soldiers knelt and said \'Amen!\'  Marching or \nencamping, the army had continually to strive with the hot air of \nthe glaring desert, or with the Saracen soldiers animated and \ndirected by the brave Saladin, or with both together.  Sickness and \ndeath, battle and wounds, were always among them; but through every \ndifficulty King Richard fought like a giant, and worked like a \ncommon labourer.  Long and long after he was quiet in his grave, \nhis terrible battle-axe, with twenty English pounds of English \nsteel in its mighty head, was a legend among the Saracens; and when \nall the Saracen and Christian hosts had been dust for many a year, \nif a Saracen horse started at any object by the wayside, his rider \nwould exclaim, \'What dost thou fear, Fool?  Dost thou think King \nRichard is behind it?\'\n\nNo one admired this King\'s renown for bravery more than Saladin \nhimself, who was a generous and gallant enemy.  When Richard lay \nill of a fever, Saladin sent him fresh fruits from Damascus, and \nsnow from the mountain-tops.  Courtly messages and compliments were \nfrequently exchanged between them - and then King Richard would \nmount his horse and kill as many Saracens as he could; and Saladin \nwould mount his, and kill as many Christians as he could.  In this \nway King Richard fought to his heart\'s content at Arsoof and at \nJaffa; and finding himself with nothing exciting to do at Ascalon, \nexcept to rebuild, for his own defence, some fortifications there \nwhich the Saracens had destroyed, he kicked his ally the Duke of \nAustria, for being too proud to work at them.\n\nThe army at last came within sight of the Holy City of Jerusalem; \nbut, being then a mere nest of jealousy, and quarrelling and \nfighting, soon retired, and agreed with the Saracens upon a truce \nfor three years, three months, three days, and three hours.  Then, \nthe English Christians, protected by the noble Saladin from Saracen \nrevenge, visited Our Saviour\'s tomb; and then King Richard embarked \nwith a small force at Acre to return home.\n\nBut he was shipwrecked in the Adriatic Sea, and was fain to pass \nthrough Germany, under an assumed name.  Now, there were many \npeople in Germany who had served in the Holy Land under that proud \nDuke of Austria who had been kicked; and some of them, easily \nrecognising a man so remarkable as King Richard, carried their \nintelligence to the kicked Duke, who straightway took him prisoner \nat a little inn near Vienna.\n\nThe Duke\'s master the Emperor of Germany, and the King of France, \nwere equally delighted to have so troublesome a monarch in safe \nkeeping.  Friendships which are founded on a partnership in doing \nwrong, are never true; and the King of France was now quite as \nheartily King Richard\'s foe, as he had ever been his friend in his \nunnatural conduct to his father.  He monstrously pretended that \nKing Richard had designed to poison him in the East; he charged him \nwith having murdered, there, a man whom he had in truth befriended; \nhe bribed the Emperor of Germany to keep him close prisoner; and, \nfinally, through the plotting of these two princes, Richard was \nbrought before the German legislature, charged with the foregoing \ncrimes, and many others.  But he defended himself so well, that \nmany of the assembly were moved to tears by his eloquence and \nearnestness.  It was decided that he should be treated, during the \nrest of his captivity, in a manner more becoming his dignity than \nhe had been, and that he should be set free on the payment of a \nheavy ransom.  This ransom the English people willingly raised.  \nWhen Queen Eleanor took it over to Germany, it was at first evaded \nand refused.  But she appealed to the honour of all the princes of \nthe German Empire in behalf of her son, and appealed so well that \nit was accepted, and the King released.  Thereupon, the King of \nFrance wrote to Prince John - \'Take care of thyself.  The devil is \nunchained!\'\n\nPrince John had reason to fear his brother, for he had been a \ntraitor to him in his captivity.  He had secretly joined the French \nKing; had vowed to the English nobles and people that his brother \nwas dead; and had vainly tried to seize the crown.  He was now in \nFrance, at a place called Evreux.  Being the meanest and basest of \nmen, he contrived a mean and base expedient for making himself \nacceptable to his brother.  He invited the French officers of the \ngarrison in that town to dinner, murdered them all, and then took \nthe fortress.  With this recommendation to the good will of a lion-\nhearted monarch, he hastened to King Richard, fell on his knees \nbefore him, and obtained the intercession of Queen Eleanor.  \'I \nforgive him,\' said the King, \'and I hope I may forget the injury he \nhas done me, as easily as I know he will forget my pardon.\'\n\nWhile King Richard was in Sicily, there had been trouble in his \ndominions at home:  one of the bishops whom he had left in charge \nthereof, arresting the other; and making, in his pride and \nambition, as great a show as if he were King himself.  But the King \nhearing of it at Messina, and appointing a new Regency, this \nLONGCHAMP (for that was his name) had fled to France in a woman\'s \ndress, and had there been encouraged and supported by the French \nKing.  With all these causes of offence against Philip in his mind, \nKing Richard had no sooner been welcomed home by his enthusiastic \nsubjects with great display and splendour, and had no sooner been \ncrowned afresh at Winchester, than he resolved to show the French \nKing that the Devil was unchained indeed, and made war against him \nwith great fury.\n\nThere was fresh trouble at home about this time, arising out of the \ndiscontents of the poor people, who complained that they were far \nmore heavily taxed than the rich, and who found a spirited champion \nin WILLIAM FITZ-OSBERT, called LONGBEARD.  He became the leader of \na secret society, comprising fifty thousand men; he was seized by \nsurprise; he stabbed the citizen who first laid hands upon him; and \nretreated, bravely fighting, to a church, which he maintained four \ndays, until he was dislodged by fire, and run through the body as \nhe came out.  He was not killed, though; for he was dragged, half \ndead, at the tail of a horse to Smithfield, and there hanged.  \nDeath was long a favourite remedy for silencing the people\'s \nadvocates; but as we go on with this history, I fancy we shall find \nthem difficult to make an end of, for all that.\n\nThe French war, delayed occasionally by a truce, was still in \nprogress when a certain Lord named VIDOMAR, Viscount of Limoges, \nchanced to find in his ground a treasure of ancient coins.  As the \nKing\'s vassal, he sent the King half of it; but the King claimed \nthe whole.  The lord refused to yield the whole.  The King besieged \nthe lord in his castle, swore that he would take the castle by \nstorm, and hang every man of its defenders on the battlements.\n\nThere was a strange old song in that part of the country, to the \neffect that in Limoges an arrow would be made by which King Richard \nwould die.  It may be that BERTRAND DE GOURDON, a young man who was \none of the defenders of the castle, had often sung it or heard it \nsung of a winter night, and remembered it when he saw, from his \npost upon the ramparts, the King attended only by his chief officer \nriding below the walls surveying the place.  He drew an arrow to \nthe head, took steady aim, said between his teeth, \'Now I pray God \nspeed thee well, arrow!\' discharged it, and struck the King in the \nleft shoulder.\n\nAlthough the wound was not at first considered dangerous, it was \nsevere enough to cause the King to retire to his tent, and direct \nthe assault to be made without him.  The castle was taken; and \nevery man of its defenders was hanged, as the King had sworn all \nshould be, except Bertrand de Gourdon, who was reserved until the \nroyal pleasure respecting him should be known.\n\nBy that time unskilful treatment had made the wound mortal and the \nKing knew that he was dying.  He directed Bertrand to be brought \ninto his tent.  The young man was brought there, heavily chained, \nKing Richard looked at him steadily.  He looked, as steadily, at \nthe King.\n\n\'Knave!\' said King Richard.  \'What have I done to thee that thou \nshouldest take my life?\'\n\n\'What hast thou done to me?\' replied the young man.  \'With thine \nown hands thou hast killed my father and my two brothers.  Myself \nthou wouldest have hanged.  Let me die now, by any torture that \nthou wilt.  My comfort is, that no torture can save Thee.  Thou too \nmust die; and, through me, the world is quit of thee!\'\n\nAgain the King looked at the young man steadily.  Again the young \nman looked steadily at him.  Perhaps some remembrance of his \ngenerous enemy Saladin, who was not a Christian, came into the mind \nof the dying King.\n\n\'Youth!\' he said, \'I forgive thee.  Go unhurt!\'  Then, turning to \nthe chief officer who had been riding in his company when he \nreceived the wound, King Richard said:\n\n\'Take off his chains, give him a hundred shillings, and let him \ndepart.\'\n\nHe sunk down on his couch, and a dark mist seemed in his weakened \neyes to fill the tent wherein he had so often rested, and he died.  \nHis age was forty-two; he had reigned ten years.  His last command \nwas not obeyed; for the chief officer flayed Bertrand de Gourdon \nalive, and hanged him.\n\nThere is an old tune yet known - a sorrowful air will sometimes \noutlive many generations of strong men, and even last longer than \nbattle-axes with twenty pounds of steel in the head - by which this \nKing is said to have been discovered in his captivity.  BLONDEL, a \nfavourite Minstrel of King Richard, as the story relates, \nfaithfully seeking his Royal master, went singing it outside the \ngloomy walls of many foreign fortresses and prisons; until at last \nhe heard it echoed from within a dungeon, and knew the voice, and \ncried out in ecstasy, \'O Richard, O my King!\'  You may believe it, \nif you like; it would be easy to believe worse things.  Richard was \nhimself a Minstrel and a Poet.  If he had not been a Prince too, he \nmight have been a better man perhaps, and might have gone out of \nthe world with less bloodshed and waste of life to answer for.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV - ENGLAND UNDER KING JOHN, CALLED LACKLAND\n\n\n\nAT two-and-thirty years of age, JOHN became King of England.  His \npretty little nephew ARTHUR had the best claim to the throne; but \nJohn seized the treasure, and made fine promises to the nobility, \nand got himself crowned at Westminster within a few weeks after his \nbrother Richard\'s death.  I doubt whether the crown could possibly \nhave been put upon the head of a meaner coward, or a more \ndetestable villain, if England had been searched from end to end to \nfind him out.\n\nThe French King, Philip, refused to acknowledge the right of John \nto his new dignity, and declared in favour of Arthur.  You must not \nsuppose that he had any generosity of feeling for the fatherless \nboy; it merely suited his ambitious schemes to oppose the King of \nEngland.  So John and the French King went to war about Arthur.\n\nHe was a handsome boy, at that time only twelve years old.  He was \nnot born when his father, Geoffrey, had his brains trampled out at \nthe tournament; and, besides the misfortune of never having known a \nfather\'s guidance and protection, he had the additional misfortune \nto have a foolish mother (CONSTANCE by name), lately married to her \nthird husband.  She took Arthur, upon John\'s accession, to the \nFrench King, who pretended to be very much his friend, and who made \nhim a Knight, and promised him his daughter in marriage; but, who \ncared so little about him in reality, that finding it his interest \nto make peace with King John for a time, he did so without the \nleast consideration for the poor little Prince, and heartlessly \nsacrificed all his interests.\n\nYoung Arthur, for two years afterwards, lived quietly; and in the \ncourse of that time his mother died.  But, the French King then \nfinding it his interest to quarrel with King John again, again made \nArthur his pretence, and invited the orphan boy to court.  \'You \nknow your rights, Prince,\' said the French King, \'and you would \nlike to be a King.  Is it not so?\'  \'Truly,\' said Prince Arthur, \'I \nshould greatly like to be a King!\'  \'Then,\' said Philip, \'you shall \nhave two hundred gentlemen who are Knights of mine, and with them \nyou shall go to win back the provinces belonging to you, of which \nyour uncle, the usurping King of England, has taken possession.  I \nmyself, meanwhile, will head a force against him in Normandy.\'  \nPoor Arthur was so flattered and so grateful that he signed a \ntreaty with the crafty French King, agreeing to consider him his \nsuperior Lord, and that the French King should keep for himself \nwhatever he could take from King John.\n\nNow, King John was so bad in all ways, and King Philip was so \nperfidious, that Arthur, between the two, might as well have been a \nlamb between a fox and a wolf.  But, being so young, he was ardent \nand flushed with hope; and, when the people of Brittany (which was \nhis inheritance) sent him five hundred more knights and five \nthousand foot soldiers, he believed his fortune was made.  The \npeople of Brittany had been fond of him from his birth, and had \nrequested that he might be called Arthur, in remembrance of that \ndimly-famous English Arthur, of whom I told you early in this book, \nwhom they believed to have been the brave friend and companion of \nan old King of their own.  They had tales among them about a \nprophet called MERLIN (of the same old time), who had foretold that \ntheir own King should be restored to them after hundreds of years; \nand they believed that the prophecy would be fulfilled in Arthur; \nthat the time would come when he would rule them with a crown of \nBrittany upon his head; and when neither King of France nor King of \nEngland would have any power over them.  When Arthur found himself \nriding in a glittering suit of armour on a richly caparisoned \nhorse, at the head of his train of knights and soldiers, he began \nto believe this too, and to consider old Merlin a very superior \nprophet.\n\nHe did not know - how could he, being so innocent and \ninexperienced? - that his little army was a mere nothing against \nthe power of the King of England.  The French King knew it; but the \npoor boy\'s fate was little to him, so that the King of England was \nworried and distressed.  Therefore, King Philip went his way into \nNormandy and Prince Arthur went his way towards Mirebeau, a French \ntown near Poictiers, both very well pleased.\n\nPrince Arthur went to attack the town of Mirebeau, because his \ngrandmother Eleanor, who has so often made her appearance in this \nhistory (and who had always been his mother\'s enemy), was living \nthere, and because his Knights said, \'Prince, if you can take her \nprisoner, you will be able to bring the King your uncle to terms!\'  \nBut she was not to be easily taken.  She was old enough by this \ntime - eighty - but she was as full of stratagem as she was full of \nyears and wickedness.  Receiving intelligence of young Arthur\'s \napproach, she shut herself up in a high tower, and encouraged her \nsoldiers to defend it like men.  Prince Arthur with his little army \nbesieged the high tower.  King John, hearing how matters stood, \ncame up to the rescue, with HIS army.  So here was a strange \nfamily-party!  The boy-Prince besieging his grandmother, and his \nuncle besieging him!\n\nThis position of affairs did not last long.  One summer night King \nJohn, by treachery, got his men into the town, surprised Prince \nArthur\'s force, took two hundred of his knights, and seized the \nPrince himself in his bed.  The Knights were put in heavy irons, \nand driven away in open carts drawn by bullocks, to various \ndungeons where they were most inhumanly treated, and where some of \nthem were starved to death.  Prince Arthur was sent to the castle \nof Falaise.\n\nOne day, while he was in prison at that castle, mournfully thinking \nit strange that one so young should be in so much trouble, and \nlooking out of the small window in the deep dark wall, at the \nsummer sky and the birds, the door was softly opened, and he saw \nhis uncle the King standing in the shadow of the archway, looking \nvery grim.\n\n\'Arthur,\' said the King, with his wicked eyes more on the stone \nfloor than on his nephew, \'will you not trust to the gentleness, \nthe friendship, and the truthfulness of your loving uncle?\'\n\n\'I will tell my loving uncle that,\' replied the boy, \'when he does \nme right.  Let him restore to me my kingdom of England, and then \ncome to me and ask the question.\'\n\nThe King looked at him and went out.  \'Keep that boy close \nprisoner,\' said he to the warden of the castle.\n\nThen, the King took secret counsel with the worst of his nobles how \nthe Prince was to be got rid of.  Some said, \'Put out his eyes and \nkeep him in prison, as Robort of Normandy was kept.\'  Others said, \n\'Have him stabbed.\'  Others, \'Have him hanged.\'  Others, \'Have him \npoisoned.\'\n\nKing John, feeling that in any case, whatever was done afterwards, \nit would be a satisfaction to his mind to have those handsome eyes \nburnt out that had looked at him so proudly while his own royal \neyes were blinking at the stone floor, sent certain ruffians to \nFalaise to blind the boy with red-hot irons.  But Arthur so \npathetically entreated them, and shed such piteous tears, and so \nappealed to HUBERT DE BOURG (or BURGH), the warden of the castle, \nwho had a love for him, and was an honourable, tender man, that \nHubert could not bear it.  To his eternal honour he prevented the \ntorture from being performed, and, at his own risk, sent the \nsavages away.\n\nThe chafed and disappointed King bethought himself of the stabbing \nsuggestion next, and, with his shuffling manner and his cruel face, \nproposed it to one William de Bray.  \'I am a gentleman and not an \nexecutioner,\' said William de Bray, and left the presence with \ndisdain.\n\nBut it was not difficult for a King to hire a murderer in those \ndays.  King John found one for his money, and sent him down to the \ncastle of Falaise.  \'On what errand dost thou come?\' said Hubert to \nthis fellow.  \'To despatch young Arthur,\' he returned.  \'Go back to \nhim who sent thee,\' answered Hubert, \'and say that I will do it!\'\n\nKing John very well knowing that Hubert would never do it, but that \nhe courageously sent this reply to save the Prince or gain time, \ndespatched messengers to convey the young prisoner to the castle of \nRouen.\n\nArthur was soon forced from the good Hubert - of whom he had never \nstood in greater need than then - carried away by night, and lodged \nin his new prison:  where, through his grated window, he could hear \nthe deep waters of the river Seine, rippling against the stone wall \nbelow.\n\nOne dark night, as he lay sleeping, dreaming perhaps of rescue by \nthose unfortunate gentlemen who were obscurely suffering and dying \nin his cause, he was roused, and bidden by his jailer to come down \nthe staircase to the foot of the tower.  He hurriedly dressed \nhimself and obeyed.  When they came to the bottom of the winding \nstairs, and the night air from the river blew upon their faces, the \njailer trod upon his torch and put it out.  Then, Arthur, in the \ndarkness, was hurriedly drawn into a solitary boat.  And in that \nboat, he found his uncle and one other man.\n\nHe knelt to them, and prayed them not to murder him.  Deaf to his \nentreaties, they stabbed him and sunk his body in the river with \nheavy stones.  When the spring-morning broke, the tower-door was \nclosed, the boat was gone, the river sparkled on its way, and never \nmore was any trace of the poor boy beheld by mortal eyes.\n\nThe news of this atrocious murder being spread in England, awakened \na hatred of the King (already odious for his many vices, and for \nhis having stolen away and married a noble lady while his own wife \nwas living) that never slept again through his whole reign.  In \nBrittany, the indignation was intense.  Arthur\'s own sister ELEANOR \nwas in the power of John and shut up in a convent at Bristol, but \nhis half-sister ALICE was in Brittany.  The people chose her, and \nthe murdered prince\'s father-in-law, the last husband of Constance, \nto represent them; and carried their fiery complaints to King \nPhilip.  King Philip summoned King John (as the holder of territory \nin France) to come before him and defend himself.  King John \nrefusing to appear, King Philip declared him false, perjured, and \nguilty; and again made war.  In a little time, by conquering the \ngreater part of his French territory, King Philip deprived him of \none-third of his dominions.  And, through all the fighting that \ntook place, King John was always found, either to be eating and \ndrinking, like a gluttonous fool, when the danger was at a \ndistance, or to be running away, like a beaten cur, when it was \nnear.\n\nYou might suppose that when he was losing his dominions at this \nrate, and when his own nobles cared so little for him or his cause \nthat they plainly refused to follow his banner out of England, he \nhad enemies enough.  But he made another enemy of the Pope, which \nhe did in this way.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury dying, and the junior monks of that \nplace wishing to get the start of the senior monks in the \nappointment of his successor, met together at midnight, secretly \nelected a certain REGINALD, and sent him off to Rome to get the \nPope\'s approval.  The senior monks and the King soon finding this \nout, and being very angry about it, the junior monks gave way, and \nall the monks together elected the Bishop of Norwich, who was the \nKing\'s favourite.  The Pope, hearing the whole story, declared that \nneither election would do for him, and that HE elected STEPHEN \nLANGTON.  The monks submitting to the Pope, the King turned them \nall out bodily, and banished them as traitors.  The Pope sent three \nbishops to the King, to threaten him with an Interdict.  The King \ntold the bishops that if any Interdict were laid upon his kingdom, \nhe would tear out the eyes and cut off the noses of all the monks \nhe could lay hold of, and send them over to Rome in that \nundecorated state as a present for their master.  The bishops, \nnevertheless, soon published the Interdict, and fled.\n\nAfter it had lasted a year, the Pope proceeded to his next step; \nwhich was Excommunication.  King John was declared excommunicated, \nwith all the usual ceremonies.  The King was so incensed at this, \nand was made so desperate by the disaffection of his Barons and the \nhatred of his people, that it is said he even privately sent \nambassadors to the Turks in Spain, offering to renounce his \nreligion and hold his kingdom of them if they would help him.  It \nis related that the ambassadors were admitted to the presence of \nthe Turkish Emir through long lines of Moorish guards, and that \nthey found the Emir with his eyes seriously fixed on the pages of a \nlarge book, from which he never once looked up.  That they gave him \na letter from the King containing his proposals, and were gravely \ndismissed.  That presently the Emir sent for one of them, and \nconjured him, by his faith in his religion, to say what kind of man \nthe King of England truly was?  That the ambassador, thus pressed, \nreplied that the King of England was a false tyrant, against whom \nhis own subjects would soon rise.  And that this was quite enough \nfor the Emir.\n\nMoney being, in his position, the next best thing to men, King John \nspared no means of getting it.  He set on foot another oppressing \nand torturing of the unhappy Jews (which was quite in his way), and \ninvented a new punishment for one wealthy Jew of Bristol.  Until \nsuch time as that Jew should produce a certain large sum of money, \nthe King sentenced him to be imprisoned, and, every day, to have \none tooth violently wrenched out of his head - beginning with the \ndouble teeth.  For seven days, the oppressed man bore the daily \npain and lost the daily tooth; but, on the eighth, he paid the \nmoney.  With the treasure raised in such ways, the King made an \nexpedition into Ireland, where some English nobles had revolted.  \nIt was one of the very few places from which he did not run away; \nbecause no resistance was shown.  He made another expedition into \nWales - whence he DID run away in the end:  but not before he had \ngot from the Welsh people, as hostages, twenty-seven young men of \nthe best families; every one of whom he caused to be slain in the \nfollowing year.\n\nTo Interdict and Excommunication, the Pope now added his last \nsentence; Deposition.  He proclaimed John no longer King, absolved \nall his subjects from their allegiance, and sent Stephen Langton \nand others to the King of France to tell him that, if he would \ninvade England, he should be forgiven all his sins - at least, \nshould be forgiven them by the Pope, if that would do.\n\nAs there was nothing that King Philip desired more than to invade \nEngland, he collected a great army at Rouen, and a fleet of \nseventeen hundred ships to bring them over.  But the English \npeople, however bitterly they hated the King, were not a people to \nsuffer invasion quietly.  They flocked to Dover, where the English \nstandard was, in such great numbers to enrol themselves as \ndefenders of their native land, that there were not provisions for \nthem, and the King could only select and retain sixty thousand.  \nBut, at this crisis, the Pope, who had his own reasons for \nobjecting to either King John or King Philip being too powerful, \ninterfered.  He entrusted a legate, whose name was PANDOLF, with \nthe easy task of frightening King John.  He sent him to the English \nCamp, from France, to terrify him with exaggerations of King \nPhilip\'s power, and his own weakness in the discontent of the \nEnglish Barons and people.  Pandolf discharged his commission so \nwell, that King John, in a wretched panic, consented to acknowledge \nStephen Langton; to resign his kingdom \'to God, Saint Peter, and \nSaint Paul\' - which meant the Pope; and to hold it, ever \nafterwards, by the Pope\'s leave, on payment of an annual sum of \nmoney.  To this shameful contract he publicly bound himself in the \nchurch of the Knights Templars at Dover:  where he laid at the \nlegate\'s feet a part of the tribute, which the legate haughtily \ntrampled upon.  But they DO say, that this was merely a genteel \nflourish, and that he was afterwards seen to pick it up and pocket \nit.\n\nThere was an unfortunate prophet, the name of Peter, who had \ngreatly increased King John\'s terrors by predicting that he would \nbe unknighted (which the King supposed to signify that he would \ndie) before the Feast of the Ascension should be past.  That was \nthe day after this humiliation.  When the next morning came, and \nthe King, who had been trembling all night, found himself alive and \nsafe, he ordered the prophet - and his son too - to be dragged \nthrough the streets at the tails of horses, and then hanged, for \nhaving frightened him.\n\nAs King John had now submitted, the Pope, to King Philip\'s great \nastonishment, took him under his protection, and informed King \nPhilip that he found he could not give him leave to invade England.  \nThe angry Philip resolved to do it without his leave but he gained \nnothing and lost much; for, the English, commanded by the Earl of \nSalisbury, went over, in five hundred ships, to the French coast, \nbefore the French fleet had sailed away from it, and utterly \ndefeated the whole.\n\nThe Pope then took off his three sentences, one after another, and \nempowered Stephen Langton publicly to receive King John into the \nfavour of the Church again, and to ask him to dinner.  The King, \nwho hated Langton with all his might and main - and with reason \ntoo, for he was a great and a good man, with whom such a King could \nhave no sympathy - pretended to cry and to be VERY grateful.  There \nwas a little difficulty about settling how much the King should pay \nas a recompense to the clergy for the losses he had caused them; \nbut, the end of it was, that the superior clergy got a good deal, \nand the inferior clergy got little or nothing - which has also \nhappened since King John\'s time, I believe.\n\nWhen all these matters were arranged, the King in his triumph \nbecame more fierce, and false, and insolent to all around him than \nhe had ever been.  An alliance of sovereigns against King Philip, \ngave him an opportunity of landing an army in France; with which he \neven took a town!  But, on the French King\'s gaining a great \nvictory, he ran away, of course, and made a truce for five years.\n\nAnd now the time approached when he was to be still further \nhumbled, and made to feel, if he could feel anything, what a \nwretched creature he was.  Of all men in the world, Stephen Langton \nseemed raised up by Heaven to oppose and subdue him.  When he \nruthlessly burnt and destroyed the property of his own subjects, \nbecause their Lords, the Barons, would not serve him abroad, \nStephen Langton fearlessly reproved and threatened him.  When he \nswore to restore the laws of King Edward, or the laws of King Henry \nthe First, Stephen Langton knew his falsehood, and pursued him \nthrough all his evasions.  When the Barons met at the abbey of \nSaint Edmund\'s-Bury, to consider their wrongs and the King\'s \noppressions, Stephen Langton roused them by his fervid words to \ndemand a solemn charter of rights and liberties from their perjured \nmaster, and to swear, one by one, on the High Altar, that they \nwould have it, or would wage war against him to the death.  When \nthe King hid himself in London from the Barons, and was at last \nobliged to receive them, they told him roundly they would not \nbelieve him unless Stephen Langton became a surety that he would \nkeep his word.  When he took the Cross to invest himself with some \ninterest, and belong to something that was received with favour, \nStephen Langton was still immovable.  When he appealed to the Pope, \nand the Pope wrote to Stephen Langton in behalf of his new \nfavourite, Stephen Langton was deaf, even to the Pope himself, and \nsaw before him nothing but the welfare of England and the crimes of \nthe English King.\n\nAt Easter-time, the Barons assembled at Stamford, in Lincolnshire, \nin proud array, and, marching near to Oxford where the King was, \ndelivered into the hands of Stephen Langton and two others, a list \nof grievances.  \'And these,\' they said, \'he must redress, or we \nwill do it for ourselves!\'  When Stephen Langton told the King as \nmuch, and read the list to him, he went half mad with rage.  But \nthat did him no more good than his afterwards trying to pacify the \nBarons with lies.  They called themselves and their followers, \'The \narmy of God and the Holy Church.\'  Marching through the country, \nwith the people thronging to them everywhere (except at \nNorthampton, where they failed in an attack upon the castle), they \nat last triumphantly set up their banner in London itself, whither \nthe whole land, tired of the tyrant, seemed to flock to join them.  \nSeven knights alone, of all the knights in England, remained with \nthe King; who, reduced to this strait, at last sent the Earl of \nPembroke to the Barons to say that he approved of everything, and \nwould meet them to sign their charter when they would.  \'Then,\' \nsaid the Barons, \'let the day be the fifteenth of June, and the \nplace, Runny-Mead.\'\n\nOn Monday, the fifteenth of June, one thousand two hundred and \nfourteen, the King came from Windsor Castle, and the Barons came \nfrom the town of Staines, and they met on Runny-Mead, which is \nstill a pleasant meadow by the Thames, where rushes grow in the \nclear water of the winding river, and its banks are green with \ngrass and trees.  On the side of the Barons, came the General of \ntheir army, ROBERT FITZ-WALTER, and a great concourse of the \nnobility of England.  With the King, came, in all, some four-and-\ntwenty persons of any note, most of whom despised him, and were \nmerely his advisers in form.  On that great day, and in that great \ncompany, the King signed MAGNA CHARTA - the great charter of \nEngland - by which he pledged himself to maintain the Church in its \nrights; to relieve the Barons of oppressive obligations as vassals \nof the Crown - of which the Barons, in their turn, pledged \nthemselves to relieve THEIR vassals, the people; to respect the \nliberties of London and all other cities and boroughs; to protect \nforeign merchants who came to England; to imprison no man without a \nfair trial; and to sell, delay, or deny justice to none.  As the \nBarons knew his falsehood well, they further required, as their \nsecurities, that he should send out of his kingdom all his foreign \ntroops; that for two months they should hold possession of the city \nof London, and Stephen Langton of the Tower; and that five-and-\ntwenty of their body, chosen by themselves, should be a lawful \ncommittee to watch the keeping of the charter, and to make war upon \nhim if he broke it.\n\nAll this he was obliged to yield.  He signed the charter with a \nsmile, and, if he could have looked agreeable, would have done so, \nas he departed from the splendid assembly.  When he got home to \nWindsor Castle, he was quite a madman in his helpless fury.  And he \nbroke the charter immediately afterwards.\n\nHe sent abroad for foreign soldiers, and sent to the Pope for help, \nand plotted to take London by surprise, while the Barons should be \nholding a great tournament at Stamford, which they had agreed to \nhold there as a celebration of the charter.  The Barons, however, \nfound him out and put it off.  Then, when the Barons desired to see \nhim and tax him with his treachery, he made numbers of appointments \nwith them, and kept none, and shifted from place to place, and was \nconstantly sneaking and skulking about.  At last he appeared at \nDover, to join his foreign soldiers, of whom numbers came into his \npay; and with them he besieged and took Rochester Castle, which was \noccupied by knights and soldiers of the Barons.  He would have \nhanged them every one; but the leader of the foreign soldiers, \nfearful of what the English people might afterwards do to him, \ninterfered to save the knights; therefore the King was fain to \nsatisfy his vengeance with the death of all the common men.  Then, \nhe sent the Earl of Salisbury, with one portion of his army, to \nravage the eastern part of his own dominions, while he carried fire \nand slaughter into the northern part; torturing, plundering, \nkilling, and inflicting every possible cruelty upon the people; \nand, every morning, setting a worthy example to his men by setting \nfire, with his own monster-hands, to the house where he had slept \nlast night.  Nor was this all; for the Pope, coming to the aid of \nhis precious friend, laid the kingdom under an Interdict again, \nbecause the people took part with the Barons.  It did not much \nmatter, for the people had grown so used to it now, that they had \nbegun to think nothing about it.  It occurred to them - perhaps to \nStephen Langton too - that they could keep their churches open, and \nring their bells, without the Pope\'s permission as well as with it.  \nSo, they tried the experiment - and found that it succeeded \nperfectly.\n\nIt being now impossible to bear the country, as a wilderness of \ncruelty, or longer to hold any terms with such a forsworn outlaw of \na King, the Barons sent to Louis, son of the French monarch, to \noffer him the English crown.  Caring as little for the Pope\'s \nexcommunication of him if he accepted the offer, as it is possible \nhis father may have cared for the Pope\'s forgiveness of his sins, \nhe landed at Sandwich (King John immediately running away from \nDover, where he happened to be), and went on to London.  The \nScottish King, with whom many of the Northern English Lords had \ntaken refuge; numbers of the foreign soldiers, numbers of the \nBarons, and numbers of the people went over to him every day; - \nKing John, the while, continually running away in all directions.\n\nThe career of Louis was checked however, by the suspicions of the \nBarons, founded on the dying declaration of a French Lord, that \nwhen the kingdom was conquered he was sworn to banish them as \ntraitors, and to give their estates to some of his own Nobles.  \nRather than suffer this, some of the Barons hesitated:  others even \nwent over to King John.\n\nIt seemed to be the turning-point of King John\'s fortunes, for, in \nhis savage and murderous course, he had now taken some towns and \nmet with some successes.  But, happily for England and humanity, \nhis death was near.  Crossing a dangerous quicksand, called the \nWash, not very far from Wisbeach, the tide came up and nearly \ndrowned his army.  He and his soldiers escaped; but, looking back \nfrom the shore when he was safe, he saw the roaring water sweep \ndown in a torrent, overturn the waggons, horses, and men, that \ncarried his treasure, and engulf them in a raging whirlpool from \nwhich nothing could be delivered.\n\nCursing, and swearing, and gnawing his fingers, he went on to \nSwinestead Abbey, where the monks set before him quantities of \npears, and peaches, and new cider - some say poison too, but there \nis very little reason to suppose so - of which he ate and drank in \nan immoderate and beastly way.  All night he lay ill of a burning \nfever, and haunted with horrible fears.  Next day, they put him in \na horse-litter, and carried him to Sleaford Castle, where he passed \nanother night of pain and horror.  Next day, they carried him, with \ngreater difficulty than on the day before, to the castle of Newark \nupon Trent; and there, on the eighteenth of October, in the forty-\nninth year of his age, and the seventeenth of his vile reign, was \nan end of this miserable brute.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE THIRD, CALLED, OF WINCHESTER\n\n\n\nIF any of the English Barons remembered the murdered Arthur\'s \nsister, Eleanor the fair maid of Brittany, shut up in her convent \nat Bristol, none among them spoke of her now, or maintained her \nright to the Crown.  The dead Usurper\'s eldest boy, HENRY by name, \nwas taken by the Earl of Pembroke, the Marshal of England, to the \ncity of Gloucester, and there crowned in great haste when he was \nonly ten years old.  As the Crown itself had been lost with the \nKing\'s treasure in the raging water, and as there was no time to \nmake another, they put a circle of plain gold upon his head \ninstead.  \'We have been the enemies of this child\'s father,\' said \nLord Pembroke, a good and true gentleman, to the few Lords who were \npresent, \'and he merited our ill-will; but the child himself is \ninnocent, and his youth demands our friendship and protection.\'  \nThose Lords felt tenderly towards the little boy, remembering their \nown young children; and they bowed their heads, and said, \'Long \nlive King Henry the Third!\'\n\nNext, a great council met at Bristol, revised Magna Charta, and \nmade Lord Pembroke Regent or Protector of England, as the King was \ntoo young to reign alone.  The next thing to be done, was to get \nrid of Prince Louis of France, and to win over those English Barons \nwho were still ranged under his banner.  He was strong in many \nparts of England, and in London itself; and he held, among other \nplaces, a certain Castle called the Castle of Mount Sorel, in \nLeicestershire.  To this fortress, after some skirmishing and \ntruce-making, Lord Pembroke laid siege.  Louis despatched an army \nof six hundred knights and twenty thousand soldiers to relieve it.  \nLord Pembroke, who was not strong enough for such a force, retired \nwith all his men.  The army of the French Prince, which had marched \nthere with fire and plunder, marched away with fire and plunder, \nand came, in a boastful swaggering manner, to Lincoln.  The town \nsubmitted; but the Castle in the town, held by a brave widow lady, \nnamed NICHOLA DE CAMVILLE (whose property it was), made such a \nsturdy resistance, that the French Count in command of the army of \nthe French Prince found it necessary to besiege this Castle.  While \nhe was thus engaged, word was brought to him that Lord Pembroke, \nwith four hundred knights, two hundred and fifty men with cross-\nbows, and a stout force both of horse and foot, was marching \ntowards him.  \'What care I?\' said the French Count.  \'The \nEnglishman is not so mad as to attack me and my great army in a \nwalled town!\'  But the Englishman did it for all that, and did it - \nnot so madly but so wisely, that he decoyed the great army into the \nnarrow, ill-paved lanes and byways of Lincoln, where its horse-\nsoldiers could not ride in any strong body; and there he made such \nhavoc with them, that the whole force surrendered themselves \nprisoners, except the Count; who said that he would never yield to \nany English traitor alive, and accordingly got killed.  The end of \nthis victory, which the English called, for a joke, the Fair of \nLincoln, was the usual one in those times - the common men were \nslain without any mercy, and the knights and gentlemen paid ransom \nand went home.\n\nThe wife of Louis, the fair BLANCHE OF CASTILE, dutifully equipped \na fleet of eighty good ships, and sent it over from France to her \nhusband\'s aid.  An English fleet of forty ships, some good and some \nbad, gallantly met them near the mouth of the Thames, and took or \nsunk sixty-five in one fight.  This great loss put an end to the \nFrench Prince\'s hopes.  A treaty was made at Lambeth, in virtue of \nwhich the English Barons who had remained attached to his cause \nreturned to their allegiance, and it was engaged on both sides that \nthe Prince and all his troops should retire peacefully to France.  \nIt was time to go; for war had made him so poor that he was obliged \nto borrow money from the citizens of London to pay his expenses \nhome.\n\nLord Pembroke afterwards applied himself to governing the country \njustly, and to healing the quarrels and disturbances that had \narisen among men in the days of the bad King John.  He caused Magna \nCharta to be still more improved, and so amended the Forest Laws \nthat a Peasant was no longer put to death for killing a stag in a \nRoyal Forest, but was only imprisoned.  It would have been well for \nEngland if it could have had so good a Protector many years longer, \nbut that was not to be.  Within three years after the young King\'s \nCoronation, Lord Pembroke died; and you may see his tomb, at this \nday, in the old Temple Church in London.\n\nThe Protectorship was now divided.  PETER DE ROCHES, whom King John \nhad made Bishop of Winchester, was entrusted with the care of the \nperson of the young sovereign; and the exercise of the Royal \nauthority was confided to EARL HUBERT DE BURGH.  These two \npersonages had from the first no liking for each other, and soon \nbecame enemies.  When the young King was declared of age, Peter de \nRoches, finding that Hubert increased in power and favour, retired \ndiscontentedly, and went abroad.  For nearly ten years afterwards \nHubert had full sway alone.\n\nBut ten years is a long time to hold the favour of a King.  This \nKing, too, as he grew up, showed a strong resemblance to his \nfather, in feebleness, inconsistency, and irresolution.  The best \nthat can be said of him is that he was not cruel.  De Roches coming \nhome again, after ten years, and being a novelty, the King began to \nfavour him and to look coldly on Hubert.  Wanting money besides, \nand having made Hubert rich, he began to dislike Hubert.  At last \nhe was made to believe, or pretended to believe, that Hubert had \nmisappropriated some of the Royal treasure; and ordered him to \nfurnish an account of all he had done in his administration.  \nBesides which, the foolish charge was brought against Hubert that \nhe had made himself the King\'s favourite by magic.  Hubert very \nwell knowing that he could never defend himself against such \nnonsense, and that his old enemy must be determined on his ruin, \ninstead of answering the charges fled to Merton Abbey.  Then the \nKing, in a violent passion, sent for the Mayor of London, and said \nto the Mayor, \'Take twenty thousand citizens, and drag me Hubert de \nBurgh out of that abbey, and bring him here.\'  The Mayor posted off \nto do it, but the Archbishop of Dublin (who was a friend of \nHubert\'s) warning the King that an abbey was a sacred place, and \nthat if he committed any violence there, he must answer for it to \nthe Church, the King changed his mind and called the Mayor back, \nand declared that Hubert should have four months to prepare his \ndefence, and should be safe and free during that time.\n\nHubert, who relied upon the King\'s word, though I think he was old \nenough to have known better, came out of Merton Abbey upon these \nconditions, and journeyed away to see his wife:  a Scottish \nPrincess who was then at St. Edmund\'s-Bury.\n\nAlmost as soon as he had departed from the Sanctuary, his enemies \npersuaded the weak King to send out one SIR GODFREY DE CRANCUMB, \nwho commanded three hundred vagabonds called the Black Band, with \norders to seize him.  They came up with him at a little town in \nEssex, called Brentwood, when he was in bed.  He leaped out of bed, \ngot out of the house, fled to the church, ran up to the altar, and \nlaid his hand upon the cross.  Sir Godfrey and the Black Band, \ncaring neither for church, altar, nor cross, dragged him forth to \nthe church door, with their drawn swords flashing round his head, \nand sent for a Smith to rivet a set of chains upon him.  When the \nSmith (I wish I knew his name!) was brought, all dark and swarthy \nwith the smoke of his forge, and panting with the speed he had \nmade; and the Black Band, falling aside to show him the Prisoner, \ncried with a loud uproar, \'Make the fetters heavy! make them \nstrong!\' the Smith dropped upon his knee - but not to the Black \nBand - and said, \'This is the brave Earl Hubert de Burgh, who \nfought at Dover Castle, and destroyed the French fleet, and has \ndone his country much good service.  You may kill me, if you like, \nbut I will never make a chain for Earl Hubert de Burgh!\'\n\nThe Black Band never blushed, or they might have blushed at this.  \nThey knocked the Smith about from one to another, and swore at him, \nand tied the Earl on horseback, undressed as he was, and carried \nhim off to the Tower of London.  The Bishops, however, were so \nindignant at the violation of the Sanctuary of the Church, that the \nfrightened King soon ordered the Black Band to take him back again; \nat the same time commanding the Sheriff of Essex to prevent his \nescaping out of Brentwood Church.  Well! the Sheriff dug a deep \ntrench all round the church, and erected a high fence, and watched \nthe church night and day; the Black Band and their Captain watched \nit too, like three hundred and one black wolves.  For thirty-nine \ndays, Hubert de Burgh remained within.  At length, upon the \nfortieth day, cold and hunger were too much for him, and he gave \nhimself up to the Black Band, who carried him off, for the second \ntime, to the Tower.  When his trial came on, he refused to plead; \nbut at last it was arranged that he should give up all the royal \nlands which had been bestowed upon him, and should be kept at the \nCastle of Devizes, in what was called \'free prison,\' in charge of \nfour knights appointed by four lords.  There, he remained almost a \nyear, until, learning that a follower of his old enemy the Bishop \nwas made Keeper of the Castle, and fearing that he might be killed \nby treachery, he climbed the ramparts one dark night, dropped from \nthe top of the high Castle wall into the moat, and coming safely to \nthe ground, took refuge in another church.  From this place he was \ndelivered by a party of horse despatched to his help by some \nnobles, who were by this time in revolt against the King, and \nassembled in Wales.  He was finally pardoned and restored to his \nestates, but he lived privately, and never more aspired to a high \npost in the realm, or to a high place in the King\'s favour.  And \nthus end - more happily than the stories of many favourites of \nKings - the adventures of Earl Hubert de Burgh.\n\nThe nobles, who had risen in revolt, were stirred up to rebellion \nby the overbearing conduct of the Bishop of Winchester, who, \nfinding that the King secretly hated the Great Charter which had \nbeen forced from his father, did his utmost to confirm him in that \ndislike, and in the preference he showed to foreigners over the \nEnglish.  Of this, and of his even publicly declaring that the \nBarons of England were inferior to those of France, the English \nLords complained with such bitterness, that the King, finding them \nwell supported by the clergy, became frightened for his throne, and \nsent away the Bishop and all his foreign associates.  On his \nmarriage, however, with ELEANOR, a French lady, the daughter of the \nCount of Provence, he openly favoured the foreigners again; and so \nmany of his wife\'s relations came over, and made such an immense \nfamily-party at court, and got so many good things, and pocketed so \nmuch money, and were so high with the English whose money they \npocketed, that the bolder English Barons murmured openly about a \nclause there was in the Great Charter, which provided for the \nbanishment of unreasonable favourites.  But, the foreigners only \nlaughed disdainfully, and said, \'What are your English laws to us?\'\n\nKing Philip of France had died, and had been succeeded by Prince \nLouis, who had also died after a short reign of three years, and \nhad been succeeded by his son of the same name - so moderate and \njust a man that he was not the least in the world like a King, as \nKings went.  ISABELLA, King Henry\'s mother, wished very much (for a \ncertain spite she had) that England should make war against this \nKing; and, as King Henry was a mere puppet in anybody\'s hands who \nknew how to manage his feebleness, she easily carried her point \nwith him.  But, the Parliament were determined to give him no money \nfor such a war.  So, to defy the Parliament, he packed up thirty \nlarge casks of silver - I don\'t know how he got so much; I dare say \nhe screwed it out of the miserable Jews - and put them aboard ship, \nand went away himself to carry war into France:  accompanied by his \nmother and his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall, who was rich and \nclever.  But he only got well beaten, and came home.\n\nThe good-humour of the Parliament was not restored by this.  They \nreproached the King with wasting the public money to make greedy \nforeigners rich, and were so stern with him, and so determined not \nto let him have more of it to waste if they could help it, that he \nwas at his wit\'s end for some, and tried so shamelessly to get all \nhe could from his subjects, by excuses or by force, that the people \nused to say the King was the sturdiest beggar in England.  He took \nthe Cross, thinking to get some money by that means; but, as it was \nvery well known that he never meant to go on a crusade, he got \nnone.  In all this contention, the Londoners were particularly keen \nagainst the King, and the King hated them warmly in return.  Hating \nor loving, however, made no difference; he continued in the same \ncondition for nine or ten years, when at last the Barons said that \nif he would solemnly confirm their liberties afresh, the Parliament \nwould vote him a large sum.\n\nAs he readily consented, there was a great meeting held in \nWestminster Hall, one pleasant day in May, when all the clergy, \ndressed in their robes and holding every one of them a burning \ncandle in his hand, stood up (the Barons being also there) while \nthe Archbishop of Canterbury read the sentence of excommunication \nagainst any man, and all men, who should henceforth, in any way, \ninfringe the Great Charter of the Kingdom.  When he had done, they \nall put out their burning candles with a curse upon the soul of any \none, and every one, who should merit that sentence.  The King \nconcluded with an oath to keep the Charter, \'As I am a man, as I am \na Christian, as I am a Knight, as I am a King!\'\n\nIt was easy to make oaths, and easy to break them; and the King did \nboth, as his father had done before him.  He took to his old \ncourses again when he was supplied with money, and soon cured of \ntheir weakness the few who had ever really trusted him.  When his \nmoney was gone, and he was once more borrowing and begging \neverywhere with a meanness worthy of his nature, he got into a \ndifficulty with the Pope respecting the Crown of Sicily, which the \nPope said he had a right to give away, and which he offered to King \nHenry for his second son, PRINCE EDMUND.  But, if you or I give \naway what we have not got, and what belongs to somebody else, it is \nlikely that the person to whom we give it, will have some trouble \nin taking it.  It was exactly so in this case.  It was necessary to \nconquer the Sicilian Crown before it could be put upon young \nEdmund\'s head.  It could not be conquered without money.  The Pope \nordered the clergy to raise money.  The clergy, however, were not \nso obedient to him as usual; they had been disputing with him for \nsome time about his unjust preference of Italian Priests in \nEngland; and they had begun to doubt whether the King\'s chaplain, \nwhom he allowed to be paid for preaching in seven hundred churches, \ncould possibly be, even by the Pope\'s favour, in seven hundred \nplaces at once.  \'The Pope and the King together,\' said the Bishop \nof London, \'may take the mitre off my head; but, if they do, they \nwill find that I shall put on a soldier\'s helmet.  I pay nothing.\'  \nThe Bishop of Worcester was as bold as the Bishop of London, and \nwould pay nothing either.  Such sums as the more timid or more \nhelpless of the clergy did raise were squandered away, without \ndoing any good to the King, or bringing the Sicilian Crown an inch \nnearer to Prince Edmund\'s head.  The end of the business was, that \nthe Pope gave the Crown to the brother of the King of France (who \nconquered it for himself), and sent the King of England in, a bill \nof one hundred thousand pounds for the expenses of not having won \nit.\n\nThe King was now so much distressed that we might almost pity him, \nif it were possible to pity a King so shabby and ridiculous.  His \nclever brother, Richard, had bought the title of King of the Romans \nfrom the German people, and was no longer near him, to help him \nwith advice.  The clergy, resisting the very Pope, were in alliance \nwith the Barons.  The Barons were headed by SIMON DE MONTFORT, Earl \nof Leicester, married to King Henry\'s sister, and, though a \nforeigner himself, the most popular man in England against the \nforeign favourites.  When the King next met his Parliament, the \nBarons, led by this Earl, came before him, armed from head to foot, \nand cased in armour.  When the Parliament again assembled, in a \nmonth\'s time, at Oxford, this Earl was at their head, and the King \nwas obliged to consent, on oath, to what was called a Committee of \nGovernment:  consisting of twenty-four members:  twelve chosen by \nthe Barons, and twelve chosen by himself.\n\nBut, at a good time for him, his brother Richard came back.  \nRichard\'s first act (the Barons would not admit him into England on \nother terms) was to swear to be faithful to the Committee of \nGovernment - which he immediately began to oppose with all his \nmight.  Then, the Barons began to quarrel among themselves; \nespecially the proud Earl of Gloucester with the Earl of Leicester, \nwho went abroad in disgust.  Then, the people began to be \ndissatisfied with the Barons, because they did not do enough for \nthem.  The King\'s chances seemed so good again at length, that he \ntook heart enough - or caught it from his brother - to tell the \nCommittee of Government that he abolished them - as to his oath, \nnever mind that, the Pope said! - and to seize all the money in the \nMint, and to shut himself up in the Tower of London.  Here he was \njoined by his eldest son, Prince Edward; and, from the Tower, he \nmade public a letter of the Pope\'s to the world in general, \ninforming all men that he had been an excellent and just King for \nfive-and-forty years.\n\nAs everybody knew he had been nothing of the sort, nobody cared \nmuch for this document.  It so chanced that the proud Earl of \nGloucester dying, was succeeded by his son; and that his son, \ninstead of being the enemy of the Earl of Leicester, was (for the \ntime) his friend.  It fell out, therefore, that these two Earls \njoined their forces, took several of the Royal Castles in the \ncountry, and advanced as hard as they could on London.  The London \npeople, always opposed to the King, declared for them with great \njoy.  The King himself remained shut up, not at all gloriously, in \nthe Tower.  Prince Edward made the best of his way to Windsor \nCastle.  His mother, the Queen, attempted to follow him by water; \nbut, the people seeing her barge rowing up the river, and hating \nher with all their hearts, ran to London Bridge, got together a \nquantity of stones and mud, and pelted the barge as it came \nthrough, crying furiously, \'Drown the Witch!  Drown her!\'  They \nwere so near doing it, that the Mayor took the old lady under his \nprotection, and shut her up in St. Paul\'s until the danger was \npast.\n\nIt would require a great deal of writing on my part, and a great \ndeal of reading on yours, to follow the King through his disputes \nwith the Barons, and to follow the Barons through their disputes \nwith one another - so I will make short work of it for both of us, \nand only relate the chief events that arose out of these quarrels.  \nThe good King of France was asked to decide between them.  He gave \nit as his opinion that the King must maintain the Great Charter, \nand that the Barons must give up the Committee of Government, and \nall the rest that had been done by the Parliament at Oxford:  which \nthe Royalists, or King\'s party, scornfully called the Mad \nParliament.  The Barons declared that these were not fair terms, \nand they would not accept them.  Then they caused the great bell of \nSt. Paul\'s to be tolled, for the purpose of rousing up the London \npeople, who armed themselves at the dismal sound and formed quite \nan army in the streets.  I am sorry to say, however, that instead \nof falling upon the King\'s party with whom their quarrel was, they \nfell upon the miserable Jews, and killed at least five hundred of \nthem.  They pretended that some of these Jews were on the King\'s \nside, and that they kept hidden in their houses, for the \ndestruction of the people, a certain terrible composition called \nGreek Fire, which could not be put out with water, but only burnt \nthe fiercer for it.  What they really did keep in their houses was \nmoney; and this their cruel enemies wanted, and this their cruel \nenemies took, like robbers and murderers.\n\nThe Earl of Leicester put himself at the head of these Londoners \nand other forces, and followed the King to Lewes in Sussex, where \nhe lay encamped with his army.  Before giving the King\'s forces \nbattle here, the Earl addressed his soldiers, and said that King \nHenry the Third had broken so many oaths, that he had become the \nenemy of God, and therefore they would wear white crosses on their \nbreasts, as if they were arrayed, not against a fellow-Christian, \nbut against a Turk.  White-crossed accordingly, they rushed into \nthe fight.  They would have lost the day - the King having on his \nside all the foreigners in England:  and, from Scotland, JOHN \nCOMYN, JOHN BALIOL, and ROBERT BRUCE, with all their men - but for \nthe impatience of PRINCE EDWARD, who, in his hot desire to have \nvengeance on the people of London, threw the whole of his father\'s \narmy into confusion.  He was taken Prisoner; so was the King; so \nwas the King\'s brother the King of the Romans; and five thousand \nEnglishmen were left dead upon the bloody grass.\n\nFor this success, the Pope excommunicated the Earl of Leicester:  \nwhich neither the Earl nor the people cared at all about.  The \npeople loved him and supported him, and he became the real King; \nhaving all the power of the government in his own hands, though he \nwas outwardly respectful to King Henry the Third, whom he took with \nhim wherever he went, like a poor old limp court-card.  He summoned \na Parliament (in the year one thousand two hundred and sixty-five) \nwhich was the first Parliament in England that the people had any \nreal share in electing; and he grew more and more in favour with \nthe people every day, and they stood by him in whatever he did.\n\nMany of the other Barons, and particularly the Earl of Gloucester, \nwho had become by this time as proud as his father, grew jealous of \nthis powerful and popular Earl, who was proud too, and began to \nconspire against him.  Since the battle of Lewes, Prince Edward had \nbeen kept as a hostage, and, though he was otherwise treated like a \nPrince, had never been allowed to go out without attendants \nappointed by the Earl of Leicester, who watched him.  The \nconspiring Lords found means to propose to him, in secret, that \nthey should assist him to escape, and should make him their leader; \nto which he very heartily consented.\n\nSo, on a day that was agreed upon, he said to his attendants after \ndinner (being then at Hereford), \'I should like to ride on \nhorseback, this fine afternoon, a little way into the country.\'  As \nthey, too, thought it would be very pleasant to have a canter in \nthe sunshine, they all rode out of the town together in a gay \nlittle troop.  When they came to a fine level piece of turf, the \nPrince fell to comparing their horses one with another, and \noffering bets that one was faster than another; and the attendants, \nsuspecting no harm, rode galloping matches until their horses were \nquite tired.  The Prince rode no matches himself, but looked on \nfrom his saddle, and staked his money.  Thus they passed the whole \nmerry afternoon.  Now, the sun was setting, and they were all going \nslowly up a hill, the Prince\'s horse very fresh and all the other \nhorses very weary, when a strange rider mounted on a grey steed \nappeared at the top of the hill, and waved his hat.  \'What does the \nfellow mean?\' said the attendants one to another.  The Prince \nanswered on the instant by setting spurs to his horse, dashing away \nat his utmost speed, joining the man, riding into the midst of a \nlittle crowd of horsemen who were then seen waiting under some \ntrees, and who closed around him; and so he departed in a cloud of \ndust, leaving the road empty of all but the baffled attendants, who \nsat looking at one another, while their horses drooped their ears \nand panted.\n\nThe Prince joined the Earl of Gloucester at Ludlow.  The Earl of \nLeicester, with a part of the army and the stupid old King, was at \nHereford.  One of the Earl of Leicester\'s sons, Simon de Montfort, \nwith another part of the army, was in Sussex.  To prevent these two \nparts from uniting was the Prince\'s first object.  He attacked \nSimon de Montfort by night, defeated him, seized his banners and \ntreasure, and forced him into Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire, \nwhich belonged to his family.\n\nHis father, the Earl of Leicester, in the meanwhile, not knowing \nwhat had happened, marched out of Hereford, with his part of the \narmy and the King, to meet him.  He came, on a bright morning in \nAugust, to Evesham, which is watered by the pleasant river Avon.  \nLooking rather anxiously across the prospect towards Kenilworth, he \nsaw his own banners advancing; and his face brightened with joy.  \nBut, it clouded darkly when he presently perceived that the banners \nwere captured, and in the enemy\'s hands; and he said, \'It is over.  \nThe Lord have mercy on our souls, for our bodies are Prince \nEdward\'s!\'\n\nHe fought like a true Knight, nevertheless.  When his horse was \nkilled under him, he fought on foot.  It was a fierce battle, and \nthe dead lay in heaps everywhere.  The old King, stuck up in a suit \nof armour on a big war-horse, which didn\'t mind him at all, and \nwhich carried him into all sorts of places where he didn\'t want to \ngo, got into everybody\'s way, and very nearly got knocked on the \nhead by one of his son\'s men.  But he managed to pipe out, \'I am \nHarry of Winchester!\' and the Prince, who heard him, seized his \nbridle, and took him out of peril.  The Earl of Leicester still \nfought bravely, until his best son Henry was killed, and the bodies \nof his best friends choked his path; and then he fell, still \nfighting, sword in hand.  They mangled his body, and sent it as a \npresent to a noble lady - but a very unpleasant lady, I should \nthink - who was the wife of his worst enemy.  They could not mangle \nhis memory in the minds of the faithful people, though.  Many years \nafterwards, they loved him more than ever, and regarded him as a \nSaint, and always spoke of him as \'Sir Simon the Righteous.\'\n\nAnd even though he was dead, the cause for which he had fought \nstill lived, and was strong, and forced itself upon the King in the \nvery hour of victory.  Henry found himself obliged to respect the \nGreat Charter, however much he hated it, and to make laws similar \nto the laws of the Great Earl of Leicester, and to be moderate and \nforgiving towards the people at last - even towards the people of \nLondon, who had so long opposed him.  There were more risings \nbefore all this was done, but they were set at rest by these means, \nand Prince Edward did his best in all things to restore peace.  One \nSir Adam de Gourdon was the last dissatisfied knight in arms; but, \nthe Prince vanquished him in single combat, in a wood, and nobly \ngave him his life, and became his friend, instead of slaying him.  \nSir Adam was not ungrateful.  He ever afterwards remained devoted \nto his generous conqueror.\n\nWhen the troubles of the Kingdom were thus calmed, Prince Edward \nand his cousin Henry took the Cross, and went away to the Holy \nLand, with many English Lords and Knights.  Four years afterwards \nthe King of the Romans died, and, next year (one thousand two \nhundred and seventy-two), his brother the weak King of England \ndied.  He was sixty-eight years old then, and had reigned fifty-six \nyears.  He was as much of a King in death, as he had ever been in \nlife.  He was the mere pale shadow of a King at all times.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIRST, CALLED LONGSHANKS\n\n\n\nIT was now the year of our Lord one thousand two hundred and \nseventy-two; and Prince Edward, the heir to the throne, being away \nin the Holy Land, knew nothing of his father\'s death.  The Barons, \nhowever, proclaimed him King, immediately after the Royal funeral; \nand the people very willingly consented, since most men knew too \nwell by this time what the horrors of a contest for the crown were.  \nSo King Edward the First, called, in a not very complimentary \nmanner, LONGSHANKS, because of the slenderness of his legs, was \npeacefully accepted by the English Nation.\n\nHis legs had need to be strong, however long and thin they were; \nfor they had to support him through many difficulties on the fiery \nsands of Asia, where his small force of soldiers fainted, died, \ndeserted, and seemed to melt away.  But his prowess made light of \nit, and he said, \'I will go on, if I go on with no other follower \nthan my groom!\'\n\nA Prince of this spirit gave the Turks a deal of trouble.  He \nstormed Nazareth, at which place, of all places on earth, I am \nsorry to relate, he made a frightful slaughter of innocent people; \nand then he went to Acre, where he got a truce of ten years from \nthe Sultan.  He had very nearly lost his life in Acre, through the \ntreachery of a Saracen Noble, called the Emir of Jaffa, who, making \nthe pretence that he had some idea of turning Christian and wanted \nto know all about that religion, sent a trusty messenger to Edward \nvery often - with a dagger in his sleeve.  At last, one Friday in \nWhitsun week, when it was very hot, and all the sandy prospect lay \nbeneath the blazing sun, burnt up like a great overdone biscuit, \nand Edward was lying on a couch, dressed for coolness in only a \nloose robe, the messenger, with his chocolate-coloured face and his \nbright dark eyes and white teeth, came creeping in with a letter, \nand kneeled down like a tame tiger.  But, the moment Edward \nstretched out his hand to take the letter, the tiger made a spring \nat his heart.  He was quick, but Edward was quick too.  He seized \nthe traitor by his chocolate throat, threw him to the ground, and \nslew him with the very dagger he had drawn.  The weapon had struck \nEdward in the arm, and although the wound itself was slight, it \nthreatened to be mortal, for the blade of the dagger had been \nsmeared with poison.  Thanks, however, to a better surgeon than was \noften to be found in those times, and to some wholesome herbs, and \nabove all, to his faithful wife, ELEANOR, who devotedly nursed him, \nand is said by some to have sucked the poison from the wound with \nher own red lips (which I am very willing to believe), Edward soon \nrecovered and was sound again.\n\nAs the King his father had sent entreaties to him to return home, \nhe now began the journey.  He had got as far as Italy, when he met \nmessengers who brought him intelligence of the King\'s death.  \nHearing that all was quiet at home, he made no haste to return to \nhis own dominions, but paid a visit to the Pope, and went in state \nthrough various Italian Towns, where he was welcomed with \nacclamations as a mighty champion of the Cross from the Holy Land, \nand where he received presents of purple mantles and prancing \nhorses, and went along in great triumph.  The shouting people \nlittle knew that he was the last English monarch who would ever \nembark in a crusade, or that within twenty years every conquest \nwhich the Christians had made in the Holy Land at the cost of so \nmuch blood, would be won back by the Turks.  But all this came to \npass.\n\nThere was, and there is, an old town standing in a plain in France, \ncalled ChÉlons.  When the King was coming towards this place on his \nway to England, a wily French Lord, called the Count of ChÉlons, \nsent him a polite challenge to come with his knights and hold a \nfair tournament with the Count and HIS knights, and make a day of \nit with sword and lance.  It was represented to the King that the \nCount of ChÉlons was not to be trusted, and that, instead of a \nholiday fight for mere show and in good humour, he secretly meant a \nreal battle, in which the English should be defeated by superior \nforce.\n\nThe King, however, nothing afraid, went to the appointed place on \nthe appointed day with a thousand followers.  When the Count came \nwith two thousand and attacked the English in earnest, the English \nrushed at them with such valour that the Count\'s men and the \nCount\'s horses soon began to be tumbled down all over the field.  \nThe Count himself seized the King round the neck, but the King \ntumbled HIM out of his saddle in return for the compliment, and, \njumping from his own horse, and standing over him, beat away at his \niron armour like a blacksmith hammering on his anvil.  Even when \nthe Count owned himself defeated and offered his sword, the King \nwould not do him the honour to take it, but made him yield it up to \na common soldier.  There had been such fury shown in this fight, \nthat it was afterwards called the little Battle of ChÉlons.\n\nThe English were very well disposed to be proud of their King after \nthese adventures; so, when he landed at Dover in the year one \nthousand two hundred and seventy-four (being then thirty-six years \nold), and went on to Westminster where he and his good Queen were \ncrowned with great magnificence, splendid rejoicings took place.  \nFor the coronation-feast there were provided, among other eatables, \nfour hundred oxen, four hundred sheep, four hundred and fifty pigs, \neighteen wild boars, three hundred flitches of bacon, and twenty \nthousand fowls.  The fountains and conduits in the street flowed \nwith red and white wine instead of water; the rich citizens hung \nsilks and cloths of the brightest colours out of their windows to \nincrease the beauty of the show, and threw out gold and silver by \nwhole handfuls to make scrambles for the crowd.  In short, there \nwas such eating and drinking, such music and capering, such a \nringing of bells and tossing of caps, such a shouting, and singing, \nand revelling, as the narrow overhanging streets of old London City \nhad not witnessed for many a long day.  All the people were merry \nexcept the poor Jews, who, trembling within their houses, and \nscarcely daring to peep out, began to foresee that they would have \nto find the money for this joviality sooner or later.\n\nTo dismiss this sad subject of the Jews for the present, I am sorry \nto add that in this reign they were most unmercifully pillaged.  \nThey were hanged in great numbers, on accusations of having clipped \nthe King\'s coin - which all kinds of people had done.  They were \nheavily taxed; they were disgracefully badged; they were, on one \nday, thirteen years after the coronation, taken up with their wives \nand children and thrown into beastly prisons, until they purchased \ntheir release by paying to the King twelve thousand pounds.  \nFinally, every kind of property belonging to them was seized by the \nKing, except so little as would defray the charge of their taking \nthemselves away into foreign countries.  Many years elapsed before \nthe hope of gain induced any of their race to return to England, \nwhere they had been treated so heartlessly and had suffered so \nmuch.\n\nIf King Edward the First had been as bad a king to Christians as he \nwas to Jews, he would have been bad indeed.  But he was, in \ngeneral, a wise and great monarch, under whom the country much \nimproved.  He had no love for the Great Charter - few Kings had, \nthrough many, many years - but he had high qualities.  The first \nbold object which he conceived when he came home, was, to unite \nunder one Sovereign England, Scotland, and Wales; the two last of \nwhich countries had each a little king of its own, about whom the \npeople were always quarrelling and fighting, and making a \nprodigious disturbance - a great deal more than he was worth.  In \nthe course of King Edward\'s reign he was engaged, besides, in a war \nwith France.  To make these quarrels clearer, we will separate \ntheir histories and take them thus.  Wales, first.  France, second.  \nScotland, third.\n\n\nLLEWELLYN was the Prince of Wales.  He had been on the side of the \nBarons in the reign of the stupid old King, but had afterwards \nsworn allegiance to him.  When King Edward came to the throne, \nLlewellyn was required to swear allegiance to him also; which he \nrefused to do.  The King, being crowned and in his own dominions, \nthree times more required Llewellyn to come and do homage; and \nthree times more Llewellyn said he would rather not.  He was going \nto be married to ELEANOR DE MONTFORT, a young lady of the family \nmentioned in the last reign; and it chanced that this young lady, \ncoming from France with her youngest brother, EMERIC, was taken by \nan English ship, and was ordered by the English King to be \ndetained.  Upon this, the quarrel came to a head.  The King went, \nwith his fleet, to the coast of Wales, where, so encompassing \nLlewellyn, that he could only take refuge in the bleak mountain \nregion of Snowdon in which no provisions could reach him, he was \nsoon starved into an apology, and into a treaty of peace, and into \npaying the expenses of the war.  The King, however, forgave him \nsome of the hardest conditions of the treaty, and consented to his \nmarriage.  And he now thought he had reduced Wales to obedience.\n\nBut the Welsh, although they were naturally a gentle, quiet, \npleasant people, who liked to receive strangers in their cottages \namong the mountains, and to set before them with free hospitality \nwhatever they had to eat and drink, and to play to them on their \nharps, and sing their native ballads to them, were a people of \ngreat spirit when their blood was up.  Englishmen, after this \naffair, began to be insolent in Wales, and to assume the air of \nmasters; and the Welsh pride could not bear it.  Moreover, they \nbelieved in that unlucky old Merlin, some of whose unlucky old \nprophecies somebody always seemed doomed to remember when there was \na chance of its doing harm; and just at this time some blind old \ngentleman with a harp and a long white beard, who was an excellent \nperson, but had become of an unknown age and tedious, burst out \nwith a declaration that Merlin had predicted that when English \nmoney had become round, a Prince of Wales would be crowned in \nLondon.  Now, King Edward had recently forbidden the English penny \nto be cut into halves and quarters for halfpence and farthings, and \nhad actually introduced a round coin; therefore, the Welsh people \nsaid this was the time Merlin meant, and rose accordingly.\n\nKing Edward had bought over PRINCE DAVID, Llewellyn\'s brother, by \nheaping favours upon him; but he was the first to revolt, being \nperhaps troubled in his conscience.  One stormy night, he surprised \nthe Castle of Hawarden, in possession of which an English nobleman \nhad been left; killed the whole garrison, and carried off the \nnobleman a prisoner to Snowdon.  Upon this, the Welsh people rose \nlike one man.  King Edward, with his army, marching from Worcester \nto the Menai Strait, crossed it - near to where the wonderful \ntubular iron bridge now, in days so different, makes a passage for \nrailway trains - by a bridge of boats that enabled forty men to \nmarch abreast.  He subdued the Island of Anglesea, and sent his men \nforward to observe the enemy.  The sudden appearance of the Welsh \ncreated a panic among them, and they fell back to the bridge.  The \ntide had in the meantime risen and separated the boats; the Welsh \npursuing them, they were driven into the sea, and there they sunk, \nin their heavy iron armour, by thousands.  After this victory \nLlewellyn, helped by the severe winter-weather of Wales, gained \nanother battle; but the King ordering a portion of his English army \nto advance through South Wales, and catch him between two foes, and \nLlewellyn bravely turning to meet this new enemy, he was surprised \nand killed - very meanly, for he was unarmed and defenceless.  His \nhead was struck off and sent to London, where it was fixed upon the \nTower, encircled with a wreath, some say of ivy, some say of \nwillow, some say of silver, to make it look like a ghastly coin in \nridicule of the prediction.\n\nDavid, however, still held out for six months, though eagerly \nsought after by the King, and hunted by his own countrymen.  One of \nthem finally betrayed him with his wife and children.  He was \nsentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered; and from that time \nthis became the established punishment of Traitors in England - a \npunishment wholly without excuse, as being revolting, vile, and \ncruel, after its object is dead; and which has no sense in it, as \nits only real degradation (and that nothing can blot out) is to the \ncountry that permits on any consideration such abominable \nbarbarity.\n\nWales was now subdued.  The Queen giving birth to a young prince in \nthe Castle of Carnarvon, the King showed him to the Welsh people as \ntheir countryman, and called him Prince of Wales; a title that has \never since been borne by the heir-apparent to the English throne - \nwhich that little Prince soon became, by the death of his elder \nbrother.  The King did better things for the Welsh than that, by \nimproving their laws and encouraging their trade.  Disturbances \nstill took place, chiefly occasioned by the avarice and pride of \nthe English Lords, on whom Welsh lands and castles had been \nbestowed; but they were subdued, and the country never rose again.  \nThere is a legend that to prevent the people from being incited to \nrebellion by the songs of their bards and harpers, Edward had them \nall put to death.  Some of them may have fallen among other men who \nheld out against the King; but this general slaughter is, I think, \na fancy of the harpers themselves, who, I dare say, made a song \nabout it many years afterwards, and sang it by the Welsh firesides \nuntil it came to be believed.\n\nThe foreign war of the reign of Edward the First arose in this way.  \nThe crews of two vessels, one a Norman ship, and the other an \nEnglish ship, happened to go to the same place in their boats to \nfill their casks with fresh water.  Being rough angry fellows, they \nbegan to quarrel, and then to fight - the English with their fists; \nthe Normans with their knives - and, in the fight, a Norman was \nkilled.  The Norman crew, instead of revenging themselves upon \nthose English sailors with whom they had quarrelled (who were too \nstrong for them, I suspect), took to their ship again in a great \nrage, attacked the first English ship they met, laid hold of an \nunoffending merchant who happened to be on board, and brutally \nhanged him in the rigging of their own vessel with a dog at his \nfeet.  This so enraged the English sailors that there was no \nrestraining them; and whenever, and wherever, English sailors met \nNorman sailors, they fell upon each other tooth and nail.  The \nIrish and Dutch sailors took part with the English; the French and \nGenoese sailors helped the Normans; and thus the greater part of \nthe mariners sailing over the sea became, in their way, as violent \nand raging as the sea itself when it is disturbed.\n\nKing Edward\'s fame had been so high abroad that he had been chosen \nto decide a difference between France and another foreign power, \nand had lived upon the Continent three years.  At first, neither he \nnor the French King PHILIP (the good Louis had been dead some time) \ninterfered in these quarrels; but when a fleet of eighty English \nships engaged and utterly defeated a Norman fleet of two hundred, \nin a pitched battle fought round a ship at anchor, in which no \nquarter was given, the matter became too serious to be passed over.  \nKing Edward, as Duke of Guienne, was summoned to present himself \nbefore the King of France, at Paris, and answer for the damage done \nby his sailor subjects.  At first, he sent the Bishop of London as \nhis representative, and then his brother EDMUND, who was married to \nthe French Queen\'s mother.  I am afraid Edmund was an easy man, and \nallowed himself to be talked over by his charming relations, the \nFrench court ladies; at all events, he was induced to give up his \nbrother\'s dukedom for forty days - as a mere form, the French King \nsaid, to satisfy his honour - and he was so very much astonished, \nwhen the time was out, to find that the French King had no idea of \ngiving it up again, that I should not wonder if it hastened his \ndeath:  which soon took place.\n\nKing Edward was a King to win his foreign dukedom back again, if it \ncould be won by energy and valour.  He raised a large army, \nrenounced his allegiance as Duke of Guienne, and crossed the sea to \ncarry war into France.  Before any important battle was fought, \nhowever, a truce was agreed upon for two years; and in the course \nof that time, the Pope effected a reconciliation.  King Edward, who \nwas now a widower, having lost his affectionate and good wife, \nEleanor, married the French King\'s sister, MARGARET; and the Prince \nof Wales was contracted to the French King\'s daughter ISABELLA.\n\nOut of bad things, good things sometimes arise.  Out of this \nhanging of the innocent merchant, and the bloodshed and strife it \ncaused, there came to be established one of the greatest powers \nthat the English people now possess.  The preparations for the war \nbeing very expensive, and King Edward greatly wanting money, and \nbeing very arbitrary in his ways of raising it, some of the Barons \nbegan firmly to oppose him.  Two of them, in particular, HUMPHREY \nBOHUN, Earl of Hereford, and ROGER BIGOD, Earl of Norfolk, were so \nstout against him, that they maintained he had no right to command \nthem to head his forces in Guienne, and flatly refused to go there.  \n\'By Heaven, Sir Earl,\' said the King to the Earl of Hereford, in a \ngreat passion, \'you shall either go or be hanged!\'  \'By Heaven, Sir \nKing,\' replied the Earl, \'I will neither go nor yet will I be \nhanged!\' and both he and the other Earl sturdily left the court, \nattended by many Lords.  The King tried every means of raising \nmoney.  He taxed the clergy, in spite of all the Pope said to the \ncontrary; and when they refused to pay, reduced them to submission, \nby saying Very well, then they had no claim upon the government for \nprotection, and any man might plunder them who would - which a good \nmany men were very ready to do, and very readily did, and which the \nclergy found too losing a game to be played at long.  He seized all \nthe wool and leather in the hands of the merchants, promising to \npay for it some fine day; and he set a tax upon the exportation of \nwool, which was so unpopular among the traders that it was called \n\'The evil toll.\'  But all would not do.  The Barons, led by those \ntwo great Earls, declared any taxes imposed without the consent of \nParliament, unlawful; and the Parliament refused to impose taxes, \nuntil the King should confirm afresh the two Great Charters, and \nshould solemnly declare in writing, that there was no power in the \ncountry to raise money from the people, evermore, but the power of \nParliament representing all ranks of the people.  The King was very \nunwilling to diminish his own power by allowing this great \nprivilege in the Parliament; but there was no help for it, and he \nat last complied.  We shall come to another King by-and-by, who \nmight have saved his head from rolling off, if he had profited by \nthis example.\n\nThe people gained other benefits in Parliament from the good sense \nand wisdom of this King.  Many of the laws were much improved; \nprovision was made for the greater safety of travellers, and the \napprehension of thieves and murderers; the priests were prevented \nfrom holding too much land, and so becoming too powerful; and \nJustices of the Peace were first appointed (though not at first \nunder that name) in various parts of the country.\n\n\nAnd now we come to Scotland, which was the great and lasting \ntrouble of the reign of King Edward the First.\n\nAbout thirteen years after King Edward\'s coronation, Alexander the \nThird, the King of Scotland, died of a fall from his horse.  He had \nbeen married to Margaret, King Edward\'s sister.  All their children \nbeing dead, the Scottish crown became the right of a young Princess \nonly eight years old, the daughter of ERIC, King of Norway, who had \nmarried a daughter of the deceased sovereign.  King Edward \nproposed, that the Maiden of Norway, as this Princess was called, \nshould be engaged to be married to his eldest son; but, \nunfortunately, as she was coming over to England she fell sick, and \nlanding on one of the Orkney Islands, died there.  A great \ncommotion immediately began in Scotland, where as many as thirteen \nnoisy claimants to the vacant throne started up and made a general \nconfusion.\n\nKing Edward being much renowned for his sagacity and justice, it \nseems to have been agreed to refer the dispute to him.  He accepted \nthe trust, and went, with an army, to the Border-land where England \nand Scotland joined.  There, he called upon the Scottish gentlemen \nto meet him at the Castle of Norham, on the English side of the \nriver Tweed; and to that Castle they came.  But, before he would \ntake any step in the business, he required those Scottish \ngentlemen, one and all, to do homage to him as their superior Lord; \nand when they hesitated, he said, \'By holy Edward, whose crown I \nwear, I will have my rights, or I will die in maintaining them!\'  \nThe Scottish gentlemen, who had not expected this, were \ndisconcerted, and asked for three weeks to think about it.\n\nAt the end of the three weeks, another meeting took place, on a \ngreen plain on the Scottish side of the river.  Of all the \ncompetitors for the Scottish throne, there were only two who had \nany real claim, in right of their near kindred to the Royal Family.  \nThese were JOHN BALIOL and ROBERT BRUCE:  and the right was, I have \nno doubt, on the side of John Baliol.  At this particular meeting \nJohn Baliol was not present, but Robert Bruce was; and on Robert \nBruce being formally asked whether he acknowledged the King of \nEngland for his superior lord, he answered, plainly and distinctly, \nYes, he did.  Next day, John Baliol appeared, and said the same.  \nThis point settled, some arrangements were made for inquiring into \ntheir titles.\n\nThe inquiry occupied a pretty long time - more than a year.  While \nit was going on, King Edward took the opportunity of making a \njourney through Scotland, and calling upon the Scottish people of \nall degrees to acknowledge themselves his vassals, or be imprisoned \nuntil they did.  In the meanwhile, Commissioners were appointed to \nconduct the inquiry, a Parliament was held at Berwick about it, the \ntwo claimants were heard at full length, and there was a vast \namount of talking.  At last, in the great hall of the Castle of \nBerwick, the King gave judgment in favour of John Baliol:  who, \nconsenting to receive his crown by the King of England\'s favour and \npermission, was crowned at Scone, in an old stone chair which had \nbeen used for ages in the abbey there, at the coronations of \nScottish Kings.  Then, King Edward caused the great seal of \nScotland, used since the late King\'s death, to be broken in four \npieces, and placed in the English Treasury; and considered that he \nnow had Scotland (according to the common saying) under his thumb.\n\nScotland had a strong will of its own yet, however.  King Edward, \ndetermined that the Scottish King should not forget he was his \nvassal, summoned him repeatedly to come and defend himself and his \njudges before the English Parliament when appeals from the \ndecisions of Scottish courts of justice were being heard.  At \nlength, John Baliol, who had no great heart of his own, had so much \nheart put into him by the brave spirit of the Scottish people, who \ntook this as a national insult, that he refused to come any more.  \nThereupon, the King further required him to help him in his war \nabroad (which was then in progress), and to give up, as security \nfor his good behaviour in future, the three strong Scottish Castles \nof Jedburgh, Roxburgh, and Berwick.  Nothing of this being done; on \nthe contrary, the Scottish people concealing their King among their \nmountains in the Highlands and showing a determination to resist; \nEdward marched to Berwick with an army of thirty thousand foot, and \nfour thousand horse; took the Castle, and slew its whole garrison, \nand the inhabitants of the town as well - men, women, and children.  \nLORD WARRENNE, Earl of Surrey, then went on to the Castle of \nDunbar, before which a battle was fought, and the whole Scottish \narmy defeated with great slaughter.  The victory being complete, \nthe Earl of Surrey was left as guardian of Scotland; the principal \noffices in that kingdom were given to Englishmen; the more powerful \nScottish Nobles were obliged to come and live in England; the \nScottish crown and sceptre were brought away; and even the old \nstone chair was carried off and placed in Westminster Abbey, where \nyou may see it now.  Baliol had the Tower of London lent him for a \nresidence, with permission to range about within a circle of twenty \nmiles.  Three years afterwards he was allowed to go to Normandy, \nwhere he had estates, and where he passed the remaining six years \nof his life:  far more happily, I dare say, than he had lived for a \nlong while in angry Scotland.\n\nNow, there was, in the West of Scotland, a gentleman of small \nfortune, named WILLIAM WALLACE, the second son of a Scottish \nknight.  He was a man of great size and great strength; he was very \nbrave and daring; when he spoke to a body of his countrymen, he \ncould rouse them in a wonderful manner by the power of his burning \nwords; he loved Scotland dearly, and he hated England with his \nutmost might.  The domineering conduct of the English who now held \nthe places of trust in Scotland made them as intolerable to the \nproud Scottish people as they had been, under similar \ncircumstances, to the Welsh; and no man in all Scotland regarded \nthem with so much smothered rage as William Wallace.  One day, an \nEnglishman in office, little knowing what he was, affronted HIM.  \nWallace instantly struck him dead, and taking refuge among the \nrocks and hills, and there joining with his countryman, SIR WILLIAM \nDOUGLAS, who was also in arms against King Edward, became the most \nresolute and undaunted champion of a people struggling for their \nindependence that ever lived upon the earth.\n\nThe English Guardian of the Kingdom fled before him, and, thus \nencouraged, the Scottish people revolted everywhere, and fell upon \nthe English without mercy.  The Earl of Surrey, by the King\'s \ncommands, raised all the power of the Border-counties, and two \nEnglish armies poured into Scotland.  Only one Chief, in the face \nof those armies, stood by Wallace, who, with a force of forty \nthousand men, awaited the invaders at a place on the river Forth, \nwithin two miles of Stirling.  Across the river there was only one \npoor wooden bridge, called the bridge of Kildean - so narrow, that \nbut two men could cross it abreast.  With his eyes upon this \nbridge, Wallace posted the greater part of his men among some \nrising grounds, and waited calmly.  When the English army came up \non the opposite bank of the river, messengers were sent forward to \noffer terms.  Wallace sent them back with a defiance, in the name \nof the freedom of Scotland.  Some of the officers of the Earl of \nSurrey in command of the English, with THEIR eyes also on the \nbridge, advised him to be discreet and not hasty.  He, however, \nurged to immediate battle by some other officers, and particularly \nby CRESSINGHAM, King Edward\'s treasurer, and a rash man, gave the \nword of command to advance.  One thousand English crossed the \nbridge, two abreast; the Scottish troops were as motionless as \nstone images.  Two thousand English crossed; three thousand, four \nthousand, five.  Not a feather, all this time, had been seen to \nstir among the Scottish bonnets.  Now, they all fluttered.  \n\'Forward, one party, to the foot of the Bridge!\' cried Wallace, \n\'and let no more English cross!  The rest, down with me on the five \nthousand who have come over, and cut them all to pieces!\'  It was \ndone, in the sight of the whole remainder of the English army, who \ncould give no help.  Cressingham himself was killed, and the Scotch \nmade whips for their horses of his skin.\n\nKing Edward was abroad at this time, and during the successes on \nthe Scottish side which followed, and which enabled bold Wallace to \nwin the whole country back again, and even to ravage the English \nborders.  But, after a few winter months, the King returned, and \ntook the field with more than his usual energy.  One night, when a \nkick from his horse as they both lay on the ground together broke \ntwo of his ribs, and a cry arose that he was killed, he leaped into \nhis saddle, regardless of the pain he suffered, and rode through \nthe camp.  Day then appearing, he gave the word (still, of course, \nin that bruised and aching state) Forward! and led his army on to \nnear Falkirk, where the Scottish forces were seen drawn up on some \nstony ground, behind a morass.  Here, he defeated Wallace, and \nkilled fifteen thousand of his men.  With the shattered remainder, \nWallace drew back to Stirling; but, being pursued, set fire to the \ntown that it might give no help to the English, and escaped.  The \ninhabitants of Perth afterwards set fire to their houses for the \nsame reason, and the King, unable to find provisions, was forced to \nwithdraw his army.\n\nAnother ROBERT BRUCE, the grandson of him who had disputed the \nScottish crown with Baliol, was now in arms against the King (that \nelder Bruce being dead), and also JOHN COMYN, Baliol\'s nephew.  \nThese two young men might agree in opposing Edward, but could agree \nin nothing else, as they were rivals for the throne of Scotland.  \nProbably it was because they knew this, and knew what troubles must \narise even if they could hope to get the better of the great \nEnglish King, that the principal Scottish people applied to the \nPope for his interference.  The Pope, on the principle of losing \nnothing for want of trying to get it, very coolly claimed that \nScotland belonged to him; but this was a little too much, and the \nParliament in a friendly manner told him so.\n\nIn the spring time of the year one thousand three hundred and \nthree, the King sent SIR JOHN SEGRAVE, whom he made Governor of \nScotland, with twenty thousand men, to reduce the rebels.  Sir John \nwas not as careful as he should have been, but encamped at Rosslyn, \nnear Edinburgh, with his army divided into three parts.  The \nScottish forces saw their advantage; fell on each part separately; \ndefeated each; and killed all the prisoners.  Then, came the King \nhimself once more, as soon as a great army could be raised; he \npassed through the whole north of Scotland, laying waste whatsoever \ncame in his way; and he took up his winter quarters at Dunfermline.  \nThe Scottish cause now looked so hopeless, that Comyn and the other \nnobles made submission and received their pardons.  Wallace alone \nstood out.  He was invited to surrender, though on no distinct \npledge that his life should be spared; but he still defied the \nireful King, and lived among the steep crags of the Highland glens, \nwhere the eagles made their nests, and where the mountain torrents \nroared, and the white snow was deep, and the bitter winds blew \nround his unsheltered head, as he lay through many a pitch-dark \nnight wrapped up in his plaid.  Nothing could break his spirit; \nnothing could lower his courage; nothing could induce him to forget \nor to forgive his country\'s wrongs.  Even when the Castle of \nStirling, which had long held out, was besieged by the King with \nevery kind of military engine then in use; even when the lead upon \ncathedral roofs was taken down to help to make them; even when the \nKing, though an old man, commanded in the siege as if he were a \nyouth, being so resolved to conquer; even when the brave garrison \n(then found with amazement to be not two hundred people, including \nseveral ladies) were starved and beaten out and were made to submit \non their knees, and with every form of disgrace that could \naggravate their sufferings; even then, when there was not a ray of \nhope in Scotland, William Wallace was as proud and firm as if he \nhad beheld the powerful and relentless Edward lying dead at his \nfeet.\n\nWho betrayed William Wallace in the end, is not quite certain.  \nThat he was betrayed - probably by an attendant - is too true.  He \nwas taken to the Castle of Dumbarton, under SIR JOHN MENTEITH, and \nthence to London, where the great fame of his bravery and \nresolution attracted immense concourses of people to behold him.  \nHe was tried in Westminster Hall, with a crown of laurel on his \nhead - it is supposed because he was reported to have said that he \nought to wear, or that he would wear, a crown there and was found \nguilty as a robber, a murderer, and a traitor.  What they called a \nrobber (he said to those who tried him) he was, because he had \ntaken spoil from the King\'s men.  What they called a murderer, he \nwas, because he had slain an insolent Englishman.  What they called \na traitor, he was not, for he had never sworn allegiance to the \nKing, and had ever scorned to do it.  He was dragged at the tails \nof horses to West Smithfield, and there hanged on a high gallows, \ntorn open before he was dead, beheaded, and quartered.  His head \nwas set upon a pole on London Bridge, his right arm was sent to \nNewcastle, his left arm to Berwick, his legs to Perth and Aberdeen.  \nBut, if King Edward had had his body cut into inches, and had sent \nevery separate inch into a separate town, he could not have \ndispersed it half so far and wide as his fame.  Wallace will be \nremembered in songs and stories, while there are songs and stories \nin the English tongue, and Scotland will hold him dear while her \nlakes and mountains last.\n\nReleased from this dreaded enemy, the King made a fairer plan of \nGovernment for Scotland, divided the offices of honour among \nScottish gentlemen and English gentlemen, forgave past offences, \nand thought, in his old age, that his work was done.\n\nBut he deceived himself.  Comyn and Bruce conspired, and made an \nappointment to meet at Dumfries, in the church of the Minorites.  \nThere is a story that Comyn was false to Bruce, and had informed \nagainst him to the King; that Bruce was warned of his danger and \nthe necessity of flight, by receiving, one night as he sat at \nsupper, from his friend the Earl of Gloucester, twelve pennies and \na pair of spurs; that as he was riding angrily to keep his \nappointment (through a snow-storm, with his horse\'s shoes reversed \nthat he might not be tracked), he met an evil-looking serving man, \na messenger of Comyn, whom he killed, and concealed in whose dress \nhe found letters that proved Comyn\'s treachery.  However this may \nbe, they were likely enough to quarrel in any case, being hot-\nheaded rivals; and, whatever they quarrelled about, they certainly \ndid quarrel in the church where they met, and Bruce drew his dagger \nand stabbed Comyn, who fell upon the pavement.  When Bruce came \nout, pale and disturbed, the friends who were waiting for him asked \nwhat was the matter?  \'I think I have killed Comyn,\' said he.  \'You \nonly think so?\' returned one of them; \'I will make sure!\' and going \ninto the church, and finding him alive, stabbed him again and \nagain.  Knowing that the King would never forgive this new deed of \nviolence, the party then declared Bruce King of Scotland:  got him \ncrowned at Scone - without the chair; and set up the rebellious \nstandard once again.\n\nWhen the King heard of it he kindled with fiercer anger than he had \never shown yet.  He caused the Prince of Wales and two hundred and \nseventy of the young nobility to be knighted - the trees in the \nTemple Gardens were cut down to make room for their tents, and they \nwatched their armour all night, according to the old usage:  some \nin the Temple Church:  some in Westminster Abbey - and at the \npublic Feast which then took place, he swore, by Heaven, and by two \nswans covered with gold network which his minstrels placed upon the \ntable, that he would avenge the death of Comyn, and would punish \nthe false Bruce.  And before all the company, he charged the Prince \nhis son, in case that he should die before accomplishing his vow, \nnot to bury him until it was fulfilled.  Next morning the Prince \nand the rest of the young Knights rode away to the Border-country \nto join the English army; and the King, now weak and sick, followed \nin a horse-litter.\n\nBruce, after losing a battle and undergoing many dangers and much \nmisery, fled to Ireland, where he lay concealed through the winter.  \nThat winter, Edward passed in hunting down and executing Bruce\'s \nrelations and adherents, sparing neither youth nor age, and showing \nno touch of pity or sign of mercy.  In the following spring, Bruce \nreappeared and gained some victories.  In these frays, both sides \nwere grievously cruel.  For instance - Bruce\'s two brothers, being \ntaken captives desperately wounded, were ordered by the King to \ninstant execution.  Bruce\'s friend Sir John Douglas, taking his own \nCastle of Douglas out of the hands of an English Lord, roasted the \ndead bodies of the slaughtered garrison in a great fire made of \nevery movable within it; which dreadful cookery his men called the \nDouglas Larder.  Bruce, still successful, however, drove the Earl \nof Pembroke and the Earl of Gloucester into the Castle of Ayr and \nlaid siege to it.\n\nThe King, who had been laid up all the winter, but had directed the \narmy from his sick-bed, now advanced to Carlisle, and there, \ncausing the litter in which he had travelled to be placed in the \nCathedral as an offering to Heaven, mounted his horse once more, \nand for the last time.  He was now sixty-nine years old, and had \nreigned thirty-five years.  He was so ill, that in four days he \ncould go no more than six miles; still, even at that pace, he went \non and resolutely kept his face towards the Border.  At length, he \nlay down at the village of Burgh-upon-Sands; and there, telling \nthose around him to impress upon the Prince that he was to remember \nhis father\'s vow, and was never to rest until he had thoroughly \nsubdued Scotland, he yielded up his last breath.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SECOND\n\n\n\nKING Edward the Second, the first Prince of Wales, was twenty-three \nyears old when his father died.  There was a certain favourite of \nhis, a young man from Gascony, named PIERS GAVESTON, of whom his \nfather had so much disapproved that he had ordered him out of \nEngland, and had made his son swear by the side of his sick-bed, \nnever to bring him back.  But, the Prince no sooner found himself \nKing, than he broke his oath, as so many other Princes and Kings \ndid (they were far too ready to take oaths), and sent for his dear \nfriend immediately.\n\nNow, this same Gaveston was handsome enough, but was a reckless, \ninsolent, audacious fellow.  He was detested by the proud English \nLords:  not only because he had such power over the King, and made \nthe Court such a dissipated place, but, also, because he could ride \nbetter than they at tournaments, and was used, in his impudence, to \ncut very bad jokes on them; calling one, the old hog; another, the \nstage-player; another, the Jew; another, the black dog of Ardenne.  \nThis was as poor wit as need be, but it made those Lords very \nwroth; and the surly Earl of Warwick, who was the black dog, swore \nthat the time should come when Piers Gaveston should feel the black \ndog\'s teeth.\n\nIt was not come yet, however, nor did it seem to be coming.  The \nKing made him Earl of Cornwall, and gave him vast riches; and, when \nthe King went over to France to marry the French Princess, \nISABELLA, daughter of PHILIP LE BEL:  who was said to be the most \nbeautiful woman in the world:  he made Gaveston, Regent of the \nKingdom.  His splendid marriage-ceremony in the Church of Our Lady \nat Boulogne, where there were four Kings and three Queens present \n(quite a pack of Court Cards, for I dare say the Knaves were not \nwanting), being over, he seemed to care little or nothing for his \nbeautiful wife; but was wild with impatience to meet Gaveston \nagain.\n\nWhen he landed at home, he paid no attention to anybody else, but \nran into the favourite\'s arms before a great concourse of people, \nand hugged him, and kissed him, and called him his brother.  At the \ncoronation which soon followed, Gaveston was the richest and \nbrightest of all the glittering company there, and had the honour \nof carrying the crown.  This made the proud Lords fiercer than \never; the people, too, despised the favourite, and would never call \nhim Earl of Cornwall, however much he complained to the King and \nasked him to punish them for not doing so, but persisted in styling \nhim plain Piers Gaveston.\n\nThe Barons were so unceremonious with the King in giving him to \nunderstand that they would not bear this favourite, that the King \nwas obliged to send him out of the country.  The favourite himself \nwas made to take an oath (more oaths!) that he would never come \nback, and the Barons supposed him to be banished in disgrace, until \nthey heard that he was appointed Governor of Ireland.  Even this \nwas not enough for the besotted King, who brought him home again in \na year\'s time, and not only disgusted the Court and the people by \nhis doting folly, but offended his beautiful wife too, who never \nliked him afterwards.\n\nHe had now the old Royal want - of money - and the Barons had the \nnew power of positively refusing to let him raise any.  He summoned \na Parliament at York; the Barons refused to make one, while the \nfavourite was near him.  He summoned another Parliament at \nWestminster, and sent Gaveston away.  Then, the Barons came, \ncompletely armed, and appointed a committee of themselves to \ncorrect abuses in the state and in the King\'s household.  He got \nsome money on these conditions, and directly set off with Gaveston \nto the Border-country, where they spent it in idling away the time, \nand feasting, while Bruce made ready to drive the English out of \nScotland.  For, though the old King had even made this poor weak \nson of his swear (as some say) that he would not bury his bones, \nbut would have them boiled clean in a caldron, and carried before \nthe English army until Scotland was entirely subdued, the second \nEdward was so unlike the first that Bruce gained strength and power \nevery day.\n\nThe committee of Nobles, after some months of deliberation, \nordained that the King should henceforth call a Parliament \ntogether, once every year, and even twice if necessary, instead of \nsummoning it only when he chose.  Further, that Gaveston should \nonce more be banished, and, this time, on pain of death if he ever \ncame back.  The King\'s tears were of no avail; he was obliged to \nsend his favourite to Flanders.  As soon as he had done so, \nhowever, he dissolved the Parliament, with the low cunning of a \nmere fool, and set off to the North of England, thinking to get an \narmy about him to oppose the Nobles.  And once again he brought \nGaveston home, and heaped upon him all the riches and titles of \nwhich the Barons had deprived him.\n\nThe Lords saw, now, that there was nothing for it but to put the \nfavourite to death.  They could have done so, legally, according to \nthe terms of his banishment; but they did so, I am sorry to say, in \na shabby manner.  Led by the Earl of Lancaster, the King\'s cousin, \nthey first of all attacked the King and Gaveston at Newcastle.  \nThey had time to escape by sea, and the mean King, having his \nprecious Gaveston with him, was quite content to leave his lovely \nwife behind.  When they were comparatively safe, they separated; \nthe King went to York to collect a force of soldiers; and the \nfavourite shut himself up, in the meantime, in Scarborough Castle \noverlooking the sea.  This was what the Barons wanted.  They knew \nthat the Castle could not hold out; they attacked it, and made \nGaveston surrender.  He delivered himself up to the Earl of \nPembroke - that Lord whom he had called the Jew - on the Earl\'s \npledging his faith and knightly word, that no harm should happen to \nhim and no violence be done him.\n\nNow, it was agreed with Gaveston that he should be taken to the \nCastle of Wallingford, and there kept in honourable custody.  They \ntravelled as far as Dedington, near Banbury, where, in the Castle \nof that place, they stopped for a night to rest.  Whether the Earl \nof Pembroke left his prisoner there, knowing what would happen, or \nreally left him thinking no harm, and only going (as he pretended) \nto visit his wife, the Countess, who was in the neighbourhood, is \nno great matter now; in any case, he was bound as an honourable \ngentleman to protect his prisoner, and he did not do it.  In the \nmorning, while the favourite was yet in bed, he was required to \ndress himself and come down into the court-yard.  He did so without \nany mistrust, but started and turned pale when he found it full of \nstrange armed men.  \'I think you know me?\' said their leader, also \narmed from head to foot.  \'I am the black dog of Ardenne!\'  The \ntime was come when Piers Gaveston was to feel the black dog\'s teeth \nindeed.  They set him on a mule, and carried him, in mock state and \nwith military music, to the black dog\'s kennel - Warwick Castle - \nwhere a hasty council, composed of some great noblemen, considered \nwhat should be done with him.  Some were for sparing him, but one \nloud voice - it was the black dog\'s bark, I dare say - sounded \nthrough the Castle Hall, uttering these words:  \'You have the fox \nin your power.  Let him go now, and you must hunt him again.\'\n\nThey sentenced him to death.  He threw himself at the feet of the \nEarl of Lancaster - the old hog - but the old hog was as savage as \nthe dog.  He was taken out upon the pleasant road, leading from \nWarwick to Coventry, where the beautiful river Avon, by which, long \nafterwards, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE was born and now lies buried, \nsparkled in the bright landscape of the beautiful May-day; and \nthere they struck off his wretched head, and stained the dust with \nhis blood.\n\nWhen the King heard of this black deed, in his grief and rage he \ndenounced relentless war against his Barons, and both sides were in \narms for half a year.  But, it then became necessary for them to \njoin their forces against Bruce, who had used the time well while \nthey were divided, and had now a great power in Scotland.\n\nIntelligence was brought that Bruce was then besieging Stirling \nCastle, and that the Governor had been obliged to pledge himself to \nsurrender it, unless he should be relieved before a certain day.  \nHereupon, the King ordered the nobles and their fighting-men to \nmeet him at Berwick; but, the nobles cared so little for the King, \nand so neglected the summons, and lost time, that only on the day \nbefore that appointed for the surrender, did the King find himself \nat Stirling, and even then with a smaller force than he had \nexpected.  However, he had, altogether, a hundred thousand men, and \nBruce had not more than forty thousand; but, Bruce\'s army was \nstrongly posted in three square columns, on the ground lying \nbetween the Burn or Brook of Bannock and the walls of Stirling \nCastle.\n\nOn the very evening, when the King came up, Bruce did a brave act \nthat encouraged his men.  He was seen by a certain HENRY DE BOHUN, \nan English Knight, riding about before his army on a little horse, \nwith a light battle-axe in his hand, and a crown of gold on his \nhead.  This English Knight, who was mounted on a strong war-horse, \ncased in steel, strongly armed, and able (as he thought) to \noverthrow Bruce by crushing him with his mere weight, set spurs to \nhis great charger, rode on him, and made a thrust at him with his \nheavy spear.  Bruce parried the thrust, and with one blow of his \nbattle-axe split his skull.\n\nThe Scottish men did not forget this, next day when the battle \nraged.  RANDOLPH, Bruce\'s valiant Nephew, rode, with the small body \nof men he commanded, into such a host of the English, all shining \nin polished armour in the sunlight, that they seemed to be \nswallowed up and lost, as if they had plunged into the sea.  But, \nthey fought so well, and did such dreadful execution, that the \nEnglish staggered.  Then came Bruce himself upon them, with all the \nrest of his army.  While they were thus hard pressed and amazed, \nthere appeared upon the hills what they supposed to be a new \nScottish army, but what were really only the camp followers, in \nnumber fifteen thousand:  whom Bruce had taught to show themselves \nat that place and time.  The Earl of Gloucester, commanding the \nEnglish horse, made a last rush to change the fortune of the day; \nbut Bruce (like Jack the Giant-killer in the story) had had pits \ndug in the ground, and covered over with turfs and stakes.  Into \nthese, as they gave way beneath the weight of the horses, riders \nand horses rolled by hundreds.  The English were completely routed; \nall their treasure, stores, and engines, were taken by the Scottish \nmen; so many waggons and other wheeled vehicles were seized, that \nit is related that they would have reached, if they had been drawn \nout in a line, one hundred and eighty miles.  The fortunes of \nScotland were, for the time, completely changed; and never was a \nbattle won, more famous upon Scottish ground, than this great \nbattle of BANNOCKBURN.\n\nPlague and famine succeeded in England; and still the powerless \nKing and his disdainful Lords were always in contention.  Some of \nthe turbulent chiefs of Ireland made proposals to Bruce, to accept \nthe rule of that country.  He sent his brother Edward to them, who \nwas crowned King of Ireland.  He afterwards went himself to help \nhis brother in his Irish wars, but his brother was defeated in the \nend and killed.  Robert Bruce, returning to Scotland, still \nincreased his strength there.\n\nAs the King\'s ruin had begun in a favourite, so it seemed likely to \nend in one.  He was too poor a creature to rely at all upon \nhimself; and his new favourite was one HUGH LE DESPENSER, the son \nof a gentleman of ancient family.  Hugh was handsome and brave, but \nhe was the favourite of a weak King, whom no man cared a rush for, \nand that was a dangerous place to hold.  The Nobles leagued against \nhim, because the King liked him; and they lay in wait, both for his \nruin and his father\'s.  Now, the King had married him to the \ndaughter of the late Earl of Gloucester, and had given both him and \nhis father great possessions in Wales.  In their endeavours to \nextend these, they gave violent offence to an angry Welsh \ngentleman, named JOHN DE MOWBRAY, and to divers other angry Welsh \ngentlemen, who resorted to arms, took their castles, and seized \ntheir estates.  The Earl of Lancaster had first placed the \nfavourite (who was a poor relation of his own) at Court, and he \nconsidered his own dignity offended by the preference he received \nand the honours he acquired; so he, and the Barons who were his \nfriends, joined the Welshmen, marched on London, and sent a message \nto the King demanding to have the favourite and his father \nbanished.  At first, the King unaccountably took it into his head \nto be spirited, and to send them a bold reply; but when they \nquartered themselves around Holborn and Clerkenwell, and went down, \narmed, to the Parliament at Westminster, he gave way, and complied \nwith their demands.\n\nHis turn of triumph came sooner than he expected.  It arose out of \nan accidental circumstance.  The beautiful Queen happening to be \ntravelling, came one night to one of the royal castles, and \ndemanded to be lodged and entertained there until morning.  The \ngovernor of this castle, who was one of the enraged lords, was \naway, and in his absence, his wife refused admission to the Queen; \na scuffle took place among the common men on either side, and some \nof the royal attendants were killed.  The people, who cared nothing \nfor the King, were very angry that their beautiful Queen should be \nthus rudely treated in her own dominions; and the King, taking \nadvantage of this feeling, besieged the castle, took it, and then \ncalled the two Despensers home.  Upon this, the confederate lords \nand the Welshmen went over to Bruce.  The King encountered them at \nBoroughbridge, gained the victory, and took a number of \ndistinguished prisoners; among them, the Earl of Lancaster, now an \nold man, upon whose destruction he was resolved.  This Earl was \ntaken to his own castle of Pontefract, and there tried and found \nguilty by an unfair court appointed for the purpose; he was not \neven allowed to speak in his own defence.  He was insulted, pelted, \nmounted on a starved pony without saddle or bridle, carried out, \nand beheaded.  Eight-and-twenty knights were hanged, drawn, and \nquartered.  When the King had despatched this bloody work, and had \nmade a fresh and a long truce with Bruce, he took the Despensers \ninto greater favour than ever, and made the father Earl of \nWinchester.\n\nOne prisoner, and an important one, who was taken at Boroughbridge, \nmade his escape, however, and turned the tide against the King.  \nThis was ROGER MORTIMER, always resolutely opposed to him, who was \nsentenced to death, and placed for safe custody in the Tower of \nLondon.  He treated his guards to a quantity of wine into which he \nhad put a sleeping potion; and, when they were insensible, broke \nout of his dungeon, got into a kitchen, climbed up the chimney, let \nhimself down from the roof of the building with a rope-ladder, \npassed the sentries, got down to the river, and made away in a boat \nto where servants and horses were waiting for him.  He finally \nescaped to France, where CHARLES LE BEL, the brother of the \nbeautiful Queen, was King.  Charles sought to quarrel with the King \nof England, on pretence of his not having come to do him homage at \nhis coronation.  It was proposed that the beautiful Queen should go \nover to arrange the dispute; she went, and wrote home to the King, \nthat as he was sick and could not come to France himself, perhaps \nit would be better to send over the young Prince, their son, who \nwas only twelve years old, who could do homage to her brother in \nhis stead, and in whose company she would immediately return.  The \nKing sent him:  but, both he and the Queen remained at the French \nCourt, and Roger Mortimer became the Queen\'s lover.\n\nWhen the King wrote, again and again, to the Queen to come home, \nshe did not reply that she despised him too much to live with him \nany more (which was the truth), but said she was afraid of the two \nDespensers.  In short, her design was to overthrow the favourites\' \npower, and the King\'s power, such as it was, and invade England.  \nHaving obtained a French force of two thousand men, and being \njoined by all the English exiles then in France, she landed, within \na year, at Orewell, in Suffolk, where she was immediately joined by \nthe Earls of Kent and Norfolk, the King\'s two brothers; by other \npowerful noblemen; and lastly, by the first English general who was \ndespatched to check her:  who went over to her with all his men.  \nThe people of London, receiving these tidings, would do nothing for \nthe King, but broke open the Tower, let out all his prisoners, and \nthrew up their caps and hurrahed for the beautiful Queen.\n\nThe King, with his two favourites, fled to Bristol, where he left \nold Despenser in charge of the town and castle, while he went on \nwith the son to Wales.  The Bristol men being opposed to the King, \nand it being impossible to hold the town with enemies everywhere \nwithin the walls, Despenser yielded it up on the third day, and was \ninstantly brought to trial for having traitorously influenced what \nwas called \'the King\'s mind\' - though I doubt if the King ever had \nany.  He was a venerable old man, upwards of ninety years of age, \nbut his age gained no respect or mercy.  He was hanged, torn open \nwhile he was yet alive, cut up into pieces, and thrown to the dogs.  \nHis son was soon taken, tried at Hereford before the same judge on \na long series of foolish charges, found guilty, and hanged upon a \ngallows fifty feet high, with a chaplet of nettles round his head.  \nHis poor old father and he were innocent enough of any worse crimes \nthan the crime of having been friends of a King, on whom, as a mere \nman, they would never have deigned to cast a favourable look.  It \nis a bad crime, I know, and leads to worse; but, many lords and \ngentlemen - I even think some ladies, too, if I recollect right - \nhave committed it in England, who have neither been given to the \ndogs, nor hanged up fifty feet high.\n\nThe wretched King was running here and there, all this time, and \nnever getting anywhere in particular, until he gave himself up, and \nwas taken off to Kenilworth Castle.  When he was safely lodged \nthere, the Queen went to London and met the Parliament.  And the \nBishop of Hereford, who was the most skilful of her friends, said, \nWhat was to be done now?  Here was an imbecile, indolent, miserable \nKing upon the throne; wouldn\'t it be better to take him off, and \nput his son there instead?  I don\'t know whether the Queen really \npitied him at this pass, but she began to cry; so, the Bishop said, \nWell, my Lords and Gentlemen, what do you think, upon the whole, of \nsending down to Kenilworth, and seeing if His Majesty (God bless \nhim, and forbid we should depose him!) won\'t resign?\n\nMy Lords and Gentlemen thought it a good notion, so a deputation of \nthem went down to Kenilworth; and there the King came into the \ngreat hall of the Castle, commonly dressed in a poor black gown; \nand when he saw a certain bishop among them, fell down, poor \nfeeble-headed man, and made a wretched spectacle of himself.  \nSomebody lifted him up, and then SIR WILLIAM TRUSSEL, the Speaker \nof the House of Commons, almost frightened him to death by making \nhim a tremendous speech to the effect that he was no longer a King, \nand that everybody renounced allegiance to him.  After which, SIR \nTHOMAS BLOUNT, the Steward of the Household, nearly finished him, \nby coming forward and breaking his white wand - which was a \nceremony only performed at a King\'s death.  Being asked in this \npressing manner what he thought of resigning, the King said he \nthought it was the best thing he could do.  So, he did it, and they \nproclaimed his son next day.\n\nI wish I could close his history by saying that he lived a harmless \nlife in the Castle and the Castle gardens at Kenilworth, many years \n- that he had a favourite, and plenty to eat and drink - and, \nhaving that, wanted nothing.  But he was shamefully humiliated.  He \nwas outraged, and slighted, and had dirty water from ditches given \nhim to shave with, and wept and said he would have clean warm \nwater, and was altogether very miserable.  He was moved from this \ncastle to that castle, and from that castle to the other castle, \nbecause this lord or that lord, or the other lord, was too kind to \nhim:  until at last he came to Berkeley Castle, near the River \nSevern, where (the Lord Berkeley being then ill and absent) he fell \ninto the hands of two black ruffians, called THOMAS GOURNAY and \nWILLIAM OGLE.\n\nOne night - it was the night of September the twenty-first, one \nthousand three hundred and twenty-seven - dreadful screams were \nheard, by the startled people in the neighbouring town, ringing \nthrough the thick walls of the Castle, and the dark, deep night; \nand they said, as they were thus horribly awakened from their \nsleep, \'May Heaven be merciful to the King; for those cries forbode \nthat no good is being done to him in his dismal prison!\'  Next \nmorning he was dead - not bruised, or stabbed, or marked upon the \nbody, but much distorted in the face; and it was whispered \nafterwards, that those two villains, Gournay and Ogle, had burnt up \nhis inside with a red-hot iron.\n\nIf you ever come near Gloucester, and see the centre tower of its \nbeautiful Cathedral, with its four rich pinnacles, rising lightly \nin the air; you may remember that the wretched Edward the Second \nwas buried in the old abbey of that ancient city, at forty-three \nyears old, after being for nineteen years and a half a perfectly \nincapable King.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE THIRD\n\n\n\nROGER MORTIMER, the Queen\'s lover (who escaped to France in the \nlast chapter), was far from profiting by the examples he had had of \nthe fate of favourites.  Having, through the Queen\'s influence, \ncome into possession of the estates of the two Despensers, he \nbecame extremely proud and ambitious, and sought to be the real \nruler of England.  The young King, who was crowned at fourteen \nyears of age with all the usual solemnities, resolved not to bear \nthis, and soon pursued Mortimer to his ruin.\n\nThe people themselves were not fond of Mortimer - first, because he \nwas a Royal favourite; secondly, because he was supposed to have \nhelped to make a peace with Scotland which now took place, and in \nvirtue of which the young King\'s sister Joan, only seven years old, \nwas promised in marriage to David, the son and heir of Robert \nBruce, who was only five years old.  The nobles hated Mortimer \nbecause of his pride, riches, and power.  They went so far as to \ntake up arms against him; but were obliged to submit.  The Earl of \nKent, one of those who did so, but who afterwards went over to \nMortimer and the Queen, was made an example of in the following \ncruel manner:\n\nHe seems to have been anything but a wise old earl; and he was \npersuaded by the agents of the favourite and the Queen, that poor \nKing Edward the Second was not really dead; and thus was betrayed \ninto writing letters favouring his rightful claim to the throne.  \nThis was made out to be high treason, and he was tried, found \nguilty, and sentenced to be executed.  They took the poor old lord \noutside the town of Winchester, and there kept him waiting some \nthree or four hours until they could find somebody to cut off his \nhead.  At last, a convict said he would do it, if the government \nwould pardon him in return; and they gave him the pardon; and at \none blow he put the Earl of Kent out of his last suspense.\n\nWhile the Queen was in France, she had found a lovely and good \nyoung lady, named Philippa, who she thought would make an excellent \nwife for her son.  The young King married this lady, soon after he \ncame to the throne; and her first child, Edward, Prince of Wales, \nafterwards became celebrated, as we shall presently see, under the \nfamous title of EDWARD THE BLACK PRINCE.\n\nThe young King, thinking the time ripe for the downfall of \nMortimer, took counsel with Lord Montacute how he should proceed.  \nA Parliament was going to be held at Nottingham, and that lord \nrecommended that the favourite should be seized by night in \nNottingham Castle, where he was sure to be.  Now, this, like many \nother things, was more easily said than done; because, to guard \nagainst treachery, the great gates of the Castle were locked every \nnight, and the great keys were carried up-stairs to the Queen, who \nlaid them under her own pillow.  But the Castle had a governor, and \nthe governor being Lord Montacute\'s friend, confided to him how he \nknew of a secret passage underground, hidden from observation by \nthe weeds and brambles with which it was overgrown; and how, \nthrough that passage, the conspirators might enter in the dead of \nthe night, and go straight to Mortimer\'s room.  Accordingly, upon a \ncertain dark night, at midnight, they made their way through this \ndismal place:  startling the rats, and frightening the owls and \nbats:  and came safely to the bottom of the main tower of the \nCastle, where the King met them, and took them up a profoundly-dark \nstaircase in a deep silence.  They soon heard the voice of Mortimer \nin council with some friends; and bursting into the room with a \nsudden noise, took him prisoner.  The Queen cried out from her bed-\nchamber, \'Oh, my sweet son, my dear son, spare my gentle Mortimer!\'  \nThey carried him off, however; and, before the next Parliament, \naccused him of having made differences between the young King and \nhis mother, and of having brought about the death of the Earl of \nKent, and even of the late King; for, as you know by this time, \nwhen they wanted to get rid of a man in those old days, they were \nnot very particular of what they accused him.  Mortimer was found \nguilty of all this, and was sentenced to be hanged at Tyburn.  The \nKing shut his mother up in genteel confinement, where she passed \nthe rest of her life; and now he became King in earnest.\n\nThe first effort he made was to conquer Scotland.  The English \nlords who had lands in Scotland, finding that their rights were not \nrespected under the late peace, made war on their own account:  \nchoosing for their general, Edward, the son of John Baliol, who \nmade such a vigorous fight, that in less than two months he won the \nwhole Scottish Kingdom.  He was joined, when thus triumphant, by \nthe King and Parliament; and he and the King in person besieged the \nScottish forces in Berwick.  The whole Scottish army coming to the \nassistance of their countrymen, such a furious battle ensued, that \nthirty thousand men are said to have been killed in it.  Baliol was \nthen crowned King of Scotland, doing homage to the King of England; \nbut little came of his successes after all, for the Scottish men \nrose against him, within no very long time, and David Bruce came \nback within ten years and took his kingdom.\n\nFrance was a far richer country than Scotland, and the King had a \nmuch greater mind to conquer it.  So, he let Scotland alone, and \npretended that he had a claim to the French throne in right of his \nmother.  He had, in reality, no claim at all; but that mattered \nlittle in those times.  He brought over to his cause many little \nprinces and sovereigns, and even courted the alliance of the people \nof Flanders - a busy, working community, who had very small respect \nfor kings, and whose head man was a brewer.  With such forces as he \nraised by these means, Edward invaded France; but he did little by \nthat, except run into debt in carrying on the war to the extent of \nthree hundred thousand pounds.  The next year he did better; \ngaining a great sea-fight in the harbour of Sluys.  This success, \nhowever, was very shortlived, for the Flemings took fright at the \nsiege of Saint Omer and ran away, leaving their weapons and baggage \nbehind them.  Philip, the French King, coming up with his army, and \nEdward being very anxious to decide the war, proposed to settle the \ndifference by single combat with him, or by a fight of one hundred \nknights on each side.  The French King said, he thanked him; but \nbeing very well as he was, he would rather not.  So, after some \nskirmishing and talking, a short peace was made.\n\nIt was soon broken by King Edward\'s favouring the cause of John, \nEarl of Montford; a French nobleman, who asserted a claim of his \nown against the French King, and offered to do homage to England \nfor the Crown of France, if he could obtain it through England\'s \nhelp.  This French lord, himself, was soon defeated by the French \nKing\'s son, and shut up in a tower in Paris; but his wife, a \ncourageous and beautiful woman, who is said to have had the courage \nof a man, and the heart of a lion, assembled the people of \nBrittany, where she then was; and, showing them her infant son, \nmade many pathetic entreaties to them not to desert her and their \nyoung Lord.  They took fire at this appeal, and rallied round her \nin the strong castle of Hennebon.  Here she was not only besieged \nwithout by the French under Charles de Blois, but was endangered \nwithin by a dreary old bishop, who was always representing to the \npeople what horrors they must undergo if they were faithful - first \nfrom famine, and afterwards from fire and sword.  But this noble \nlady, whose heart never failed her, encouraged her soldiers by her \nown example; went from post to post like a great general; even \nmounted on horseback fully armed, and, issuing from the castle by a \nby-path, fell upon the French camp, set fire to the tents, and \nthrew the whole force into disorder.  This done, she got safely \nback to Hennebon again, and was received with loud shouts of joy by \nthe defenders of the castle, who had given her up for lost.  As \nthey were now very short of provisions, however, and as they could \nnot dine off enthusiasm, and as the old bishop was always saying, \n\'I told you what it would come to!\' they began to lose heart, and \nto talk of yielding the castle up.  The brave Countess retiring to \nan upper room and looking with great grief out to sea, where she \nexpected relief from England, saw, at this very time, the English \nships in the distance, and was relieved and rescued!  Sir Walter \nManning, the English commander, so admired her courage, that, being \ncome into the castle with the English knights, and having made a \nfeast there, he assaulted the French by way of dessert, and beat \nthem off triumphantly.  Then he and the knights came back to the \ncastle with great joy; and the Countess who had watched them from a \nhigh tower, thanked them with all her heart, and kissed them every \none.\n\nThis noble lady distinguished herself afterwards in a sea-fight \nwith the French off Guernsey, when she was on her way to England to \nask for more troops.  Her great spirit roused another lady, the \nwife of another French lord (whom the French King very barbarously \nmurdered), to distinguish herself scarcely less.  The time was fast \ncoming, however, when Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be the great \nstar of this French and English war.\n\nIt was in the month of July, in the year one thousand three hundred \nand forty-six, when the King embarked at Southampton for France, \nwith an army of about thirty thousand men in all, attended by the \nPrince of Wales and by several of the chief nobles.  He landed at \nLa Hogue in Normandy; and, burning and destroying as he went, \naccording to custom, advanced up the left bank of the River Seine, \nand fired the small towns even close to Paris; but, being watched \nfrom the right bank of the river by the French King and all his \narmy, it came to this at last, that Edward found himself, on \nSaturday the twenty-sixth of August, one thousand three hundred and \nforty-six, on a rising ground behind the little French village of \nCrecy, face to face with the French King\'s force.  And, although \nthe French King had an enormous army - in number more than eight \ntimes his - he there resolved to beat him or be beaten.\n\nThe young Prince, assisted by the Earl of Oxford and the Earl of \nWarwick, led the first division of the English army; two other \ngreat Earls led the second; and the King, the third.  When the \nmorning dawned, the King received the sacrament, and heard prayers, \nand then, mounted on horseback with a white wand in his hand, rode \nfrom company to company, and rank to rank, cheering and encouraging \nboth officers and men.  Then the whole army breakfasted, each man \nsitting on the ground where he had stood; and then they remained \nquietly on the ground with their weapons ready.\n\nUp came the French King with all his great force.  It was dark and \nangry weather; there was an eclipse of the sun; there was a \nthunder-storm, accompanied with tremendous rain; the frightened \nbirds flew screaming above the soldiers\' heads.  A certain captain \nin the French army advised the French King, who was by no means \ncheerful, not to begin the battle until the morrow.  The King, \ntaking this advice, gave the word to halt.  But, those behind not \nunderstanding it, or desiring to be foremost with the rest, came \npressing on.  The roads for a great distance were covered with this \nimmense army, and with the common people from the villages, who \nwere flourishing their rude weapons, and making a great noise.  \nOwing to these circumstances, the French army advanced in the \ngreatest confusion; every French lord doing what he liked with his \nown men, and putting out the men of every other French lord.\n\nNow, their King relied strongly upon a great body of cross-bowmen \nfrom Genoa; and these he ordered to the front to begin the battle, \non finding that he could not stop it.  They shouted once, they \nshouted twice, they shouted three times, to alarm the English \narchers; but, the English would have heard them shout three \nthousand times and would have never moved.  At last the cross-\nbowmen went forward a little, and began to discharge their bolts; \nupon which, the English let fly such a hail of arrows, that the \nGenoese speedily made off - for their cross-bows, besides being \nheavy to carry, required to be wound up with a handle, and \nconsequently took time to re-load; the English, on the other hand, \ncould discharge their arrows almost as fast as the arrows could \nfly.\n\nWhen the French King saw the Genoese turning, he cried out to his \nmen to kill those scoundrels, who were doing harm instead of \nservice.  This increased the confusion.  Meanwhile the English \narchers, continuing to shoot as fast as ever, shot down great \nnumbers of the French soldiers and knights; whom certain sly \nCornish-men and Welshmen, from the English army, creeping along the \nground, despatched with great knives.\n\nThe Prince and his division were at this time so hard-pressed, that \nthe Earl of Warwick sent a message to the King, who was overlooking \nthe battle from a windmill, beseeching him to send more aid.\n\n\'Is my son killed?\' said the King.\n\n\'No, sire, please God,\' returned the messenger.\n\n\'Is he wounded?\' said the King.\n\n\'No, sire.\'\n\n\'Is he thrown to the ground?\' said the King.\n\n\'No, sire, not so; but, he is very hard-pressed.\'\n\n\'Then,\' said the King, \'go back to those who sent you, and tell \nthem I shall send no aid; because I set my heart upon my son \nproving himself this day a brave knight, and because I am resolved, \nplease God, that the honour of a great victory shall be his!\'\n\nThese bold words, being reported to the Prince and his division, so \nraised their spirits, that they fought better than ever.  The King \nof France charged gallantly with his men many times; but it was of \nno use.  Night closing in, his horse was killed under him by an \nEnglish arrow, and the knights and nobles who had clustered thick \nabout him early in the day, were now completely scattered.  At \nlast, some of his few remaining followers led him off the field by \nforce since he would not retire of himself, and they journeyed away \nto Amiens.  The victorious English, lighting their watch-fires, \nmade merry on the field, and the King, riding to meet his gallant \nson, took him in his arms, kissed him, and told him that he had \nacted nobly, and proved himself worthy of the day and of the crown.  \nWhile it was yet night, King Edward was hardly aware of the great \nvictory he had gained; but, next day, it was discovered that eleven \nprinces, twelve hundred knights, and thirty thousand common men lay \ndead upon the French side.  Among these was the King of Bohemia, an \nold blind man; who, having been told that his son was wounded in \nthe battle, and that no force could stand against the Black Prince, \ncalled to him two knights, put himself on horse-back between them, \nfastened the three bridles together, and dashed in among the \nEnglish, where he was presently slain.  He bore as his crest three \nwhite ostrich feathers, with the motto ICH DIEN, signifying in \nEnglish \'I serve.\'  This crest and motto were taken by the Prince \nof Wales in remembrance of that famous day, and have been borne by \nthe Prince of Wales ever since.\n\nFive days after this great battle, the King laid siege to Calais.  \nThis siege - ever afterwards memorable - lasted nearly a year.  In \norder to starve the inhabitants out, King Edward built so many \nwooden houses for the lodgings of his troops, that it is said their \nquarters looked like a second Calais suddenly sprung around the \nfirst.  Early in the siege, the governor of the town drove out what \nhe called the useless mouths, to the number of seventeen hundred \npersons, men and women, young and old.  King Edward allowed them to \npass through his lines, and even fed them, and dismissed them with \nmoney; but, later in the siege, he was not so merciful - five \nhundred more, who were afterwards driven out, dying of starvation \nand misery.  The garrison were so hard-pressed at last, that they \nsent a letter to King Philip, telling him that they had eaten all \nthe horses, all the dogs, and all the rats and mice that could be \nfound in the place; and, that if he did not relieve them, they must \neither surrender to the English, or eat one another.  Philip made \none effort to give them relief; but they were so hemmed in by the \nEnglish power, that he could not succeed, and was fain to leave the \nplace.  Upon this they hoisted the English flag, and surrendered to \nKing Edward.  \'Tell your general,\' said he to the humble messengers \nwho came out of the town, \'that I require to have sent here, six of \nthe most distinguished citizens, bare-legged, and in their shirts, \nwith ropes about their necks; and let those six men bring with them \nthe keys of the castle and the town.\'\n\nWhen the Governor of Calais related this to the people in the \nMarket-place, there was great weeping and distress; in the midst of \nwhich, one worthy citizen, named Eustace de Saint Pierre, rose up \nand said, that if the six men required were not sacrificed, the \nwhole population would be; therefore, he offered himself as the \nfirst.  Encouraged by this bright example, five other worthy \ncitizens rose up one after another, and offered themselves to save \nthe rest.  The Governor, who was too badly wounded to be able to \nwalk, mounted a poor old horse that had not been eaten, and \nconducted these good men to the gate, while all the people cried \nand mourned.\n\nEdward received them wrathfully, and ordered the heads of the whole \nsix to be struck off.  However, the good Queen fell upon her knees, \nand besought the King to give them up to her.  The King replied, \'I \nwish you had been somewhere else; but I cannot refuse you.\'  So she \nhad them properly dressed, made a feast for them, and sent them \nback with a handsome present, to the great rejoicing of the whole \ncamp.  I hope the people of Calais loved the daughter to whom she \ngave birth soon afterwards, for her gentle mother\'s sake.\n\nNow came that terrible disease, the Plague, into Europe, hurrying \nfrom the heart of China; and killed the wretched people - \nespecially the poor - in such enormous numbers, that one-half of \nthe inhabitants of England are related to have died of it.  It \nkilled the cattle, in great numbers, too; and so few working men \nremained alive, that there were not enough left to till the ground.\n\nAfter eight years of differing and quarrelling, the Prince of Wales \nagain invaded France with an army of sixty thousand men.  He went \nthrough the south of the country, burning and plundering \nwheresoever he went; while his father, who had still the Scottish \nwar upon his hands, did the like in Scotland, but was harassed and \nworried in his retreat from that country by the Scottish men, who \nrepaid his cruelties with interest.\n\nThe French King, Philip, was now dead, and was succeeded by his son \nJohn.  The Black Prince, called by that name from the colour of the \narmour he wore to set off his fair complexion, continuing to burn \nand destroy in France, roused John into determined opposition; and \nso cruel had the Black Prince been in his campaign, and so severely \nhad the French peasants suffered, that he could not find one who, \nfor love, or money, or the fear of death, would tell him what the \nFrench King was doing, or where he was.  Thus it happened that he \ncame upon the French King\'s forces, all of a sudden, near the town \nof Poitiers, and found that the whole neighbouring country was \noccupied by a vast French army.  \'God help us!\' said the Black \nPrince, \'we must make the best of it.\'\n\nSo, on a Sunday morning, the eighteenth of September, the Prince \nwhose army was now reduced to ten thousand men in all - prepared to \ngive battle to the French King, who had sixty thousand horse alone.  \nWhile he was so engaged, there came riding from the French camp, a \nCardinal, who had persuaded John to let him offer terms, and try to \nsave the shedding of Christian blood.  \'Save my honour,\' said the \nPrince to this good priest, \'and save the honour of my army, and I \nwill make any reasonable terms.\'  He offered to give up all the \ntowns, castles, and prisoners, he had taken, and to swear to make \nno war in France for seven years; but, as John would hear of \nnothing but his surrender, with a hundred of his chief knights, the \ntreaty was broken off, and the Prince said quietly - \'God defend \nthe right; we shall fight to-morrow.\'\n\nTherefore, on the Monday morning, at break of day, the two armies \nprepared for battle.  The English were posted in a strong place, \nwhich could only be approached by one narrow lane, skirted by \nhedges on both sides.  The French attacked them by this lane; but \nwere so galled and slain by English arrows from behind the hedges, \nthat they were forced to retreat.  Then went six hundred English \nbowmen round about, and, coming upon the rear of the French army, \nrained arrows on them thick and fast.  The French knights, thrown \ninto confusion, quitted their banners and dispersed in all \ndirections.  Said Sir John Chandos to the Prince, \'Ride forward, \nnoble Prince, and the day is yours.  The King of France is so \nvaliant a gentleman, that I know he will never fly, and may be \ntaken prisoner.\'  Said the Prince to this, \'Advance, English \nbanners, in the name of God and St. George!\' and on they pressed \nuntil they came up with the French King, fighting fiercely with his \nbattle-axe, and, when all his nobles had forsaken him, attended \nfaithfully to the last by his youngest son Philip, only sixteen \nyears of age.  Father and son fought well, and the King had already \ntwo wounds in his face, and had been beaten down, when he at last \ndelivered himself to a banished French knight, and gave him his \nright-hand glove in token that he had done so.\n\nThe Black Prince was generous as well as brave, and he invited his \nroyal prisoner to supper in his tent, and waited upon him at table, \nand, when they afterwards rode into London in a gorgeous \nprocession, mounted the French King on a fine cream-coloured horse, \nand rode at his side on a little pony.  This was all very kind, but \nI think it was, perhaps, a little theatrical too, and has been made \nmore meritorious than it deserved to be; especially as I am \ninclined to think that the greatest kindness to the King of France \nwould have been not to have shown him to the people at all.  \nHowever, it must be said, for these acts of politeness, that, in \ncourse of time, they did much to soften the horrors of war and the \npassions of conquerors.  It was a long, long time before the common \nsoldiers began to have the benefit of such courtly deeds; but they \ndid at last; and thus it is possible that a poor soldier who asked \nfor quarter at the battle of Waterloo, or any other such great \nfight, may have owed his life indirectly to Edward the Black \nPrince.\n\nAt this time there stood in the Strand, in London, a palace called \nthe Savoy, which was given up to the captive King of France and his \nson for their residence.  As the King of Scotland had now been King \nEdward\'s captive for eleven years too, his success was, at this \ntime, tolerably complete.  The Scottish business was settled by the \nprisoner being released under the title of Sir David, King of \nScotland, and by his engaging to pay a large ransom.  The state of \nFrance encouraged England to propose harder terms to that country, \nwhere the people rose against the unspeakable cruelty and barbarity \nof its nobles; where the nobles rose in turn against the people; \nwhere the most frightful outrages were committed on all sides; and \nwhere the insurrection of the peasants, called the insurrection of \nthe Jacquerie, from Jacques, a common Christian name among the \ncountry people of France, awakened terrors and hatreds that have \nscarcely yet passed away.  A treaty called the Great Peace, was at \nlast signed, under which King Edward agreed to give up the greater \npart of his conquests, and King John to pay, within six years, a \nransom of three million crowns of gold.  He was so beset by his own \nnobles and courtiers for having yielded to these conditions - \nthough they could help him to no better - that he came back of his \nown will to his old palace-prison of the Savoy, and there died.\n\nThere was a Sovereign of Castile at that time, called PEDRO THE \nCRUEL, who deserved the name remarkably well:  having committed, \namong other cruelties, a variety of murders.  This amiable monarch \nbeing driven from his throne for his crimes, went to the province \nof Bordeaux, where the Black Prince - now married to his cousin \nJOAN, a pretty widow - was residing, and besought his help.  The \nPrince, who took to him much more kindly than a prince of such fame \nought to have taken to such a ruffian, readily listened to his fair \npromises, and agreeing to help him, sent secret orders to some \ntroublesome disbanded soldiers of his and his father\'s, who called \nthemselves the Free Companions, and who had been a pest to the \nFrench people, for some time, to aid this Pedro.  The Prince, \nhimself, going into Spain to head the army of relief, soon set \nPedro on his throne again - where he no sooner found himself, than, \nof course, he behaved like the villain he was, broke his word \nwithout the least shame, and abandoned all the promises he had made \nto the Black Prince.\n\nNow, it had cost the Prince a good deal of money to pay soldiers to \nsupport this murderous King; and finding himself, when he came back \ndisgusted to Bordeaux, not only in bad health, but deeply in debt, \nhe began to tax his French subjects to pay his creditors.  They \nappealed to the French King, CHARLES; war again broke out; and the \nFrench town of Limoges, which the Prince had greatly benefited, \nwent over to the French King.  Upon this he ravaged the province of \nwhich it was the capital; burnt, and plundered, and killed in the \nold sickening way; and refused mercy to the prisoners, men, women, \nand children taken in the offending town, though he was so ill and \nso much in need of pity himself from Heaven, that he was carried in \na litter.  He lived to come home and make himself popular with the \npeople and Parliament, and he died on Trinity Sunday, the eighth of \nJune, one thousand three hundred and seventy-six, at forty-six \nyears old.\n\nThe whole nation mourned for him as one of the most renowned and \nbeloved princes it had ever had; and he was buried with great \nlamentations in Canterbury Cathedral.  Near to the tomb of Edward \nthe Confessor, his monument, with his figure, carved in stone, and \nrepresented in the old black armour, lying on its back, may be seen \nat this day, with an ancient coat of mail, a helmet, and a pair of \ngauntlets hanging from a beam above it, which most people like to \nbelieve were once worn by the Black Prince.\n\nKing Edward did not outlive his renowned son, long.  He was old, \nand one Alice Perrers, a beautiful lady, had contrived to make him \nso fond of her in his old age, that he could refuse her nothing, \nand made himself ridiculous.  She little deserved his love, or - \nwhat I dare say she valued a great deal more - the jewels of the \nlate Queen, which he gave her among other rich presents.  She took \nthe very ring from his finger on the morning of the day when he \ndied, and left him to be pillaged by his faithless servants.  Only \none good priest was true to him, and attended him to the last.\n\nBesides being famous for the great victories I have related, the \nreign of King Edward the Third was rendered memorable in better \nways, by the growth of architecture and the erection of Windsor \nCastle.  In better ways still, by the rising up of WICKLIFFE, \noriginally a poor parish priest:  who devoted himself to exposing, \nwith wonderful power and success, the ambition and corruption of \nthe Pope, and of the whole church of which he was the head.\n\nSome of those Flemings were induced to come to England in this \nreign too, and to settle in Norfolk, where they made better woollen \ncloths than the English had ever had before.  The Order of the \nGarter (a very fine thing in its way, but hardly so important as \ngood clothes for the nation) also dates from this period.  The King \nis said to have picked \'up a lady\'s garter at a ball, and to have \nsaid, HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE - in English, \'Evil be to him who \nevil thinks of it.\'  The courtiers were usually glad to imitate \nwhat the King said or did, and hence from a slight incident the \nOrder of the Garter was instituted, and became a great dignity.  So \nthe story goes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX - ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE SECOND\n\n\n\nRICHARD, son of the Black Prince, a boy eleven years of age, \nsucceeded to the Crown under the title of King Richard the Second.  \nThe whole English nation were ready to admire him for the sake of \nhis brave father.  As to the lords and ladies about the Court, they \ndeclared him to be the most beautiful, the wisest, and the best - \neven of princes - whom the lords and ladies about the Court, \ngenerally declare to be the most beautiful, the wisest, and the \nbest of mankind.  To flatter a poor boy in this base manner was not \na very likely way to develop whatever good was in him; and it \nbrought him to anything but a good or happy end.\n\nThe Duke of Lancaster, the young King\'s uncle - commonly called \nJohn of Gaunt, from having been born at Ghent, which the common \npeople so pronounced - was supposed to have some thoughts of the \nthrone himself; but, as he was not popular, and the memory of the \nBlack Prince was, he submitted to his nephew.\n\nThe war with France being still unsettled, the Government of \nEngland wanted money to provide for the expenses that might arise \nout of it; accordingly a certain tax, called the Poll-tax, which \nhad originated in the last reign, was ordered to be levied on the \npeople.  This was a tax on every person in the kingdom, male and \nfemale, above the age of fourteen, of three groats (or three four-\npenny pieces) a year; clergymen were charged more, and only beggars \nwere exempt.\n\nI have no need to repeat that the common people of England had long \nbeen suffering under great oppression.  They were still the mere \nslaves of the lords of the land on which they lived, and were on \nmost occasions harshly and unjustly treated.  But, they had begun \nby this time to think very seriously of not bearing quite so much; \nand, probably, were emboldened by that French insurrection I \nmentioned in the last chapter.\n\nThe people of Essex rose against the Poll-tax, and being severely \nhandled by the government officers, killed some of them.  At this \nvery time one of the tax-collectors, going his rounds from house to \nhouse, at Dartford in Kent came to the cottage of one WAT, a tiler \nby trade, and claimed the tax upon his daughter.  Her mother, who \nwas at home, declared that she was under the age of fourteen; upon \nthat, the collector (as other collectors had already done in \ndifferent parts of England) behaved in a savage way, and brutally \ninsulted Wat Tyler\'s daughter.  The daughter screamed, the mother \nscreamed.  Wat the Tiler, who was at work not far off, ran to the \nspot, and did what any honest father under such provocation might \nhave done - struck the collector dead at a blow.\n\nInstantly the people of that town uprose as one man.  They made Wat \nTyler their leader; they joined with the people of Essex, who were \nin arms under a priest called JACK STRAW; they took out of prison \nanother priest named JOHN BALL; and gathering in numbers as they \nwent along, advanced, in a great confused army of poor men, to \nBlackheath.  It is said that they wanted to abolish all property, \nand to declare all men equal.  I do not think this very likely; \nbecause they stopped the travellers on the roads and made them \nswear to be true to King Richard and the people.  Nor were they at \nall disposed to injure those who had done them no harm, merely \nbecause they were of high station; for, the King\'s mother, who had \nto pass through their camp at Blackheath, on her way to her young \nson, lying for safety in the Tower of London, had merely to kiss a \nfew dirty-faced rough-bearded men who were noisily fond of royalty, \nand so got away in perfect safety.  Next day the whole mass marched \non to London Bridge.\n\nThere was a drawbridge in the middle, which WILLIAM WALWORTH the \nMayor caused to be raised to prevent their coming into the city; \nbut they soon terrified the citizens into lowering it again, and \nspread themselves, with great uproar, over the streets.  They broke \nopen the prisons; they burned the papers in Lambeth Palace; they \ndestroyed the DUKE OF LANCASTER\'S Palace, the Savoy, in the Strand, \nsaid to be the most beautiful and splendid in England; they set \nfire to the books and documents in the Temple; and made a great \nriot.  Many of these outrages were committed in drunkenness; since \nthose citizens, who had well-filled cellars, were only too glad to \nthrow them open to save the rest of their property; but even the \ndrunken rioters were very careful to steal nothing.  They were so \nangry with one man, who was seen to take a silver cup at the Savoy \nPalace, and put it in his breast, that they drowned him in the \nriver, cup and all.\n\nThe young King had been taken out to treat with them before they \ncommitted these excesses; but, he and the people about him were so \nfrightened by the riotous shouts, that they got back to the Tower \nin the best way they could.  This made the insurgents bolder; so \nthey went on rioting away, striking off the heads of those who did \nnot, at a moment\'s notice, declare for King Richard and the people; \nand killing as many of the unpopular persons whom they supposed to \nbe their enemies as they could by any means lay hold of.  In this \nmanner they passed one very violent day, and then proclamation was \nmade that the King would meet them at Mile-end, and grant their \nrequests.\n\nThe rioters went to Mile-end to the number of sixty thousand, and \nthe King met them there, and to the King the rioters peaceably \nproposed four conditions.  First, that neither they, nor their \nchildren, nor any coming after them, should be made slaves any \nmore.  Secondly, that the rent of land should be fixed at a certain \nprice in money, instead of being paid in service.  Thirdly, that \nthey should have liberty to buy and sell in all markets and public \nplaces, like other free men.  Fourthly, that they should be \npardoned for past offences.  Heaven knows, there was nothing very \nunreasonable in these proposals!  The young King deceitfully \npretended to think so, and kept thirty clerks up, all night, \nwriting out a charter accordingly.\n\nNow, Wat Tyler himself wanted more than this.  He wanted the entire \nabolition of the forest laws.  He was not at Mile-end with the \nrest, but, while that meeting was being held, broke into the Tower \nof London and slew the archbishop and the treasurer, for whose \nheads the people had cried out loudly the day before.  He and his \nmen even thrust their swords into the bed of the Princess of Wales \nwhile the Princess was in it, to make certain that none of their \nenemies were concealed there.\n\nSo, Wat and his men still continued armed, and rode about the city.  \nNext morning, the King with a small train of some sixty gentlemen - \namong whom was WALWORTH the Mayor - rode into Smithfield, and saw \nWat and his people at a little distance.  Says Wat to his men, \n\'There is the King.  I will go speak with him, and tell him what we \nwant.\'\n\nStraightway Wat rode up to him, and began to talk.  \'King,\' says \nWat, \'dost thou see all my men there?\'\n\n\'Ah,\' says the King.  \'Why?\'\n\n\'Because,\' says Wat, \'they are all at my command, and have sworn to \ndo whatever I bid them.\'\n\nSome declared afterwards that as Wat said this, he laid his hand on \nthe King\'s bridle.  Others declared that he was seen to play with \nhis own dagger.  I think, myself, that he just spoke to the King \nlike a rough, angry man as he was, and did nothing more.  At any \nrate he was expecting no attack, and preparing for no resistance, \nwhen Walworth the Mayor did the not very valiant deed of drawing a \nshort sword and stabbing him in the throat.  He dropped from his \nhorse, and one of the King\'s people speedily finished him.  So fell \nWat Tyler.  Fawners and flatterers made a mighty triumph of it, and \nset up a cry which will occasionally find an echo to this day.  But \nWat was a hard-working man, who had suffered much, and had been \nfoully outraged; and it is probable that he was a man of a much \nhigher nature and a much braver spirit than any of the parasites \nwho exulted then, or have exulted since, over his defeat.\n\nSeeing Wat down, his men immediately bent their bows to avenge his \nfall.  If the young King had not had presence of mind at that \ndangerous moment, both he and the Mayor to boot, might have \nfollowed Tyler pretty fast.  But the King riding up to the crowd, \ncried out that Tyler was a traitor, and that he would be their \nleader.  They were so taken by surprise, that they set up a great \nshouting, and followed the boy until he was met at Islington by a \nlarge body of soldiers.\n\nThe end of this rising was the then usual end.  As soon as the King \nfound himself safe, he unsaid all he had said, and undid all he had \ndone; some fifteen hundred of the rioters were tried (mostly in \nEssex) with great rigour, and executed with great cruelty.  Many of \nthem were hanged on gibbets, and left there as a terror to the \ncountry people; and, because their miserable friends took some of \nthe bodies down to bury, the King ordered the rest to be chained up \n- which was the beginning of the barbarous custom of hanging in \nchains.  The King\'s falsehood in this business makes such a pitiful \nfigure, that I think Wat Tyler appears in history as beyond \ncomparison the truer and more respectable man of the two.\n\nRichard was now sixteen years of age, and married Anne of Bohemia, \nan excellent princess, who was called \'the good Queen Anne.\'  She \ndeserved a better husband; for the King had been fawned and \nflattered into a treacherous, wasteful, dissolute, bad young man.\n\nThere were two Popes at this time (as if one were not enough!), and \ntheir quarrels involved Europe in a great deal of trouble.  \nScotland was still troublesome too; and at home there was much \njealousy and distrust, and plotting and counter-plotting, because \nthe King feared the ambition of his relations, and particularly of \nhis uncle, the Duke of Lancaster, and the duke had his party \nagainst the King, and the King had his party against the duke.  Nor \nwere these home troubles lessened when the duke went to Castile to \nurge his claim to the crown of that kingdom; for then the Duke of \nGloucester, another of Richard\'s uncles, opposed him, and \ninfluenced the Parliament to demand the dismissal of the King\'s \nfavourite ministers.  The King said in reply, that he would not for \nsuch men dismiss the meanest servant in his kitchen.  But, it had \nbegun to signify little what a King said when a Parliament was \ndetermined; so Richard was at last obliged to give way, and to \nagree to another Government of the kingdom, under a commission of \nfourteen nobles, for a year.  His uncle of Gloucester was at the \nhead of this commission, and, in fact, appointed everybody \ncomposing it.\n\nHaving done all this, the King declared as soon as he saw an \nopportunity that he had never meant to do it, and that it was all \nillegal; and he got the judges secretly to sign a declaration to \nthat effect.  The secret oozed out directly, and was carried to the \nDuke of Gloucester.  The Duke of Gloucester, at the head of forty \nthousand men, met the King on his entering into London to enforce \nhis authority; the King was helpless against him; his favourites \nand ministers were impeached and were mercilessly executed.  Among \nthem were two men whom the people regarded with very different \nfeelings; one, Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice, who was hated for \nhaving made what was called \'the bloody circuit\' to try the \nrioters; the other, Sir Simon Burley, an honourable knight, who had \nbeen the dear friend of the Black Prince, and the governor and \nguardian of the King.  For this gentleman\'s life the good Queen \neven begged of Gloucester on her knees; but Gloucester (with or \nwithout reason) feared and hated him, and replied, that if she \nvalued her husband\'s crown, she had better beg no more.  All this \nwas done under what was called by some the wonderful - and by \nothers, with better reason, the merciless - Parliament.\n\nBut Gloucester\'s power was not to last for ever.  He held it for \nonly a year longer; in which year the famous battle of Otterbourne, \nsung in the old ballad of Chevy Chase, was fought.  When the year \nwas out, the King, turning suddenly to Gloucester, in the midst of \na great council said, \'Uncle, how old am I?\'  \'Your highness,\' \nreturned the Duke, \'is in your twenty-second year.\'  \'Am I so \nmuch?\' said the King; \'then I will manage my own affairs!  I am \nmuch obliged to you, my good lords, for your past services, but I \nneed them no more.\'  He followed this up, by appointing a new \nChancellor and a new Treasurer, and announced to the people that he \nhad resumed the Government.  He held it for eight years without \nopposition.  Through all that time, he kept his determination to \nrevenge himself some day upon his uncle Gloucester, in his own \nbreast.\n\nAt last the good Queen died, and then the King, desiring to take a \nsecond wife, proposed to his council that he should marry Isabella, \nof France, the daughter of Charles the Sixth:  who, the French \ncourtiers said (as the English courtiers had said of Richard), was \na marvel of beauty and wit, and quite a phenomenon - of seven years \nold.  The council were divided about this marriage, but it took \nplace.  It secured peace between England and France for a quarter \nof a century; but it was strongly opposed to the prejudices of the \nEnglish people.  The Duke of Gloucester, who was anxious to take \nthe occasion of making himself popular, declaimed against it \nloudly, and this at length decided the King to execute the \nvengeance he had been nursing so long.\n\nHe went with a gay company to the Duke of Gloucester\'s house, \nPleshey Castle, in Essex, where the Duke, suspecting nothing, came \nout into the court-yard to receive his royal visitor.  While the \nKing conversed in a friendly manner with the Duchess, the Duke was \nquietly seized, hurried away, shipped for Calais, and lodged in the \ncastle there.  His friends, the Earls of Arundel and Warwick, were \ntaken in the same treacherous manner, and confined to their \ncastles.  A few days after, at Nottingham, they were impeached of \nhigh treason.  The Earl of Arundel was condemned and beheaded, and \nthe Earl of Warwick was banished.  Then, a writ was sent by a \nmessenger to the Governor of Calais, requiring him to send the Duke \nof Gloucester over to be tried.  In three days he returned an \nanswer that he could not do that, because the Duke of Gloucester \nhad died in prison.  The Duke was declared a traitor, his property \nwas confiscated to the King, a real or pretended confession he had \nmade in prison to one of the Justices of the Common Pleas was \nproduced against him, and there was an end of the matter.  How the \nunfortunate duke died, very few cared to know.  Whether he really \ndied naturally; whether he killed himself; whether, by the King\'s \norder, he was strangled, or smothered between two beds (as a \nserving-man of the Governor\'s named Hall, did afterwards declare), \ncannot be discovered.  There is not much doubt that he was killed, \nsomehow or other, by his nephew\'s orders.  Among the most active \nnobles in these proceedings were the King\'s cousin, Henry \nBolingbroke, whom the King had made Duke of Hereford to smooth down \nthe old family quarrels, and some others:  who had in the family-\nplotting times done just such acts themselves as they now condemned \nin the duke.  They seem to have been a corrupt set of men; but such \nmen were easily found about the court in such days.\n\nThe people murmured at all this, and were still very sore about the \nFrench marriage.  The nobles saw how little the King cared for law, \nand how crafty he was, and began to be somewhat afraid for \nthemselves.  The King\'s life was a life of continued feasting and \nexcess; his retinue, down to the meanest servants, were dressed in \nthe most costly manner, and caroused at his tables, it is related, \nto the number of ten thousand persons every day.  He himself, \nsurrounded by a body of ten thousand archers, and enriched by a \nduty on wool which the Commons had granted him for life, saw no \ndanger of ever being otherwise than powerful and absolute, and was \nas fierce and haughty as a King could be.\n\nHe had two of his old enemies left, in the persons of the Dukes of \nHereford and Norfolk.  Sparing these no more than the others, he \ntampered with the Duke of Hereford until he got him to declare \nbefore the Council that the Duke of Norfolk had lately held some \ntreasonable talk with him, as he was riding near Brentford; and \nthat he had told him, among other things, that he could not believe \nthe King\'s oath - which nobody could, I should think.  For this \ntreachery he obtained a pardon, and the Duke of Norfolk was \nsummoned to appear and defend himself.  As he denied the charge and \nsaid his accuser was a liar and a traitor, both noblemen, according \nto the manner of those times, were held in custody, and the truth \nwas ordered to be decided by wager of battle at Coventry.  This \nwager of battle meant that whosoever won the combat was to be \nconsidered in the right; which nonsense meant in effect, that no \nstrong man could ever be wrong.  A great holiday was made; a great \ncrowd assembled, with much parade and show; and the two combatants \nwere about to rush at each other with their lances, when the King, \nsitting in a pavilion to see fair, threw down the truncheon he \ncarried in his hand, and forbade the battle.  The Duke of Hereford \nwas to be banished for ten years, and the Duke of Norfolk was to be \nbanished for life.  So said the King.  The Duke of Hereford went to \nFrance, and went no farther.  The Duke of Norfolk made a pilgrimage \nto the Holy Land, and afterwards died at Venice of a broken heart.\n\nFaster and fiercer, after this, the King went on in his career.  \nThe Duke of Lancaster, who was the father of the Duke of Hereford, \ndied soon after the departure of his son; and, the King, although \nhe had solemnly granted to that son leave to inherit his father\'s \nproperty, if it should come to him during his banishment, \nimmediately seized it all, like a robber.  The judges were so \nafraid of him, that they disgraced themselves by declaring this \ntheft to be just and lawful.  His avarice knew no bounds.  He \noutlawed seventeen counties at once, on a frivolous pretence, \nmerely to raise money by way of fines for misconduct.  In short, he \ndid as many dishonest things as he could; and cared so little for \nthe discontent of his subjects - though even the spaniel favourites \nbegan to whisper to him that there was such a thing as discontent \nafloat - that he took that time, of all others, for leaving England \nand making an expedition against the Irish.\n\nHe was scarcely gone, leaving the DUKE OF YORK Regent in his \nabsence, when his cousin, Henry of Hereford, came over from France \nto claim the rights of which he had been so monstrously deprived.  \nHe was immediately joined by the two great Earls of Northumberland \nand Westmoreland; and his uncle, the Regent, finding the King\'s \ncause unpopular, and the disinclination of the army to act against \nHenry, very strong, withdrew with the Royal forces towards Bristol.  \nHenry, at the head of an army, came from Yorkshire (where he had \nlanded) to London and followed him.  They joined their forces - how \nthey brought that about, is not distinctly understood - and \nproceeded to Bristol Castle, whither three noblemen had taken the \nyoung Queen.  The castle surrendering, they presently put those \nthree noblemen to death.  The Regent then remained there, and Henry \nwent on to Chester.\n\nAll this time, the boisterous weather had prevented the King from \nreceiving intelligence of what had occurred.  At length it was \nconveyed to him in Ireland, and he sent over the EARL OF SALISBURY, \nwho, landing at Conway, rallied the Welshmen, and waited for the \nKing a whole fortnight; at the end of that time the Welshmen, who \nwere perhaps not very warm for him in the beginning, quite cooled \ndown and went home.  When the King did land on the coast at last, \nhe came with a pretty good power, but his men cared nothing for \nhim, and quickly deserted.  Supposing the Welshmen to be still at \nConway, he disguised himself as a priest, and made for that place \nin company with his two brothers and some few of their adherents.  \nBut, there were no Welshmen left - only Salisbury and a hundred \nsoldiers.  In this distress, the King\'s two brothers, Exeter and \nSurrey, offered to go to Henry to learn what his intentions were.  \nSurrey, who was true to Richard, was put into prison.  Exeter, who \nwas false, took the royal badge, which was a hart, off his shield, \nand assumed the rose, the badge of Henry.  After this, it was \npretty plain to the King what Henry\'s intentions were, without \nsending any more messengers to ask.\n\nThe fallen King, thus deserted - hemmed in on all sides, and \npressed with hunger - rode here and rode there, and went to this \ncastle, and went to that castle, endeavouring to obtain some \nprovisions, but could find none.  He rode wretchedly back to \nConway, and there surrendered himself to the Earl of \nNorthumberland, who came from Henry, in reality to take him \nprisoner, but in appearance to offer terms; and whose men were \nhidden not far off.  By this earl he was conducted to the castle of \nFlint, where his cousin Henry met him, and dropped on his knee as \nif he were still respectful to his sovereign.\n\n\'Fair cousin of Lancaster,\' said the King, \'you are very welcome\' \n(very welcome, no doubt; but he would have been more so, in chains \nor without a head).\n\n\'My lord,\' replied Henry, \'I am come a little before my time; but, \nwith your good pleasure, I will show you the reason.  Your people \ncomplain with some bitterness, that you have ruled them rigorously \nfor two-and-twenty years.  Now, if it please God, I will help you \nto govern them better in future.\'\n\n\'Fair cousin,\' replied the abject King, \'since it pleaseth you, it \npleaseth me mightily.\'\n\nAfter this, the trumpets sounded, and the King was stuck on a \nwretched horse, and carried prisoner to Chester, where he was made \nto issue a proclamation, calling a Parliament.  From Chester he was \ntaken on towards London.  At Lichfield he tried to escape by \ngetting out of a window and letting himself down into a garden; it \nwas all in vain, however, and he was carried on and shut up in the \nTower, where no one pitied him, and where the whole people, whose \npatience he had quite tired out, reproached him without mercy.  \nBefore he got there, it is related, that his very dog left him and \ndeparted from his side to lick the hand of Henry.\n\nThe day before the Parliament met, a deputation went to this \nwrecked King, and told him that he had promised the Earl of \nNorthumberland at Conway Castle to resign the crown.  He said he \nwas quite ready to do it, and signed a paper in which he renounced \nhis authority and absolved his people from their allegiance to him.  \nHe had so little spirit left that he gave his royal ring to his \ntriumphant cousin Henry with his own hand, and said, that if he \ncould have had leave to appoint a successor, that same Henry was \nthe man of all others whom he would have named.  Next day, the \nParliament assembled in Westminster Hall, where Henry sat at the \nside of the throne, which was empty and covered with a cloth of \ngold.  The paper just signed by the King was read to the multitude \namid shouts of joy, which were echoed through all the streets; when \nsome of the noise had died away, the King was formally deposed.  \nThen Henry arose, and, making the sign of the cross on his forehead \nand breast, challenged the realm of England as his right; the \narchbishops of Canterbury and York seated him on the throne.\n\nThe multitude shouted again, and the shouts re-echoed throughout \nall the streets.  No one remembered, now, that Richard the Second \nhad ever been the most beautiful, the wisest, and the best of \nprinces; and he now made living (to my thinking) a far more sorry \nspectacle in the Tower of London, than Wat Tyler had made, lying \ndead, among the hoofs of the royal horses in Smithfield.\n\nThe Poll-tax died with Wat.  The Smiths to the King and Royal \nFamily, could make no chains in which the King could hang the \npeople\'s recollection of him; so the Poll-tax was never collected.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FOURTH, CALLED BOLINGBROKE\n\n\n\nDURING the last reign, the preaching of Wickliffe against the pride \nand cunning of the Pope and all his men, had made a great noise in \nEngland.  Whether the new King wished to be in favour with the \npriests, or whether he hoped, by pretending to be very religious, \nto cheat Heaven itself into the belief that he was not a usurper, I \ndon\'t know.  Both suppositions are likely enough.  It is certain \nthat he began his reign by making a strong show against the \nfollowers of Wickliffe, who were called Lollards, or heretics - \nalthough his father, John of Gaunt, had been of that way of \nthinking, as he himself had been more than suspected of being.  It \nis no less certain that he first established in England the \ndetestable and atrocious custom, brought from abroad, of burning \nthose people as a punishment for their opinions.  It was the \nimportation into England of one of the practices of what was called \nthe Holy Inquisition:  which was the most UNholy and the most \ninfamous tribunal that ever disgraced mankind, and made men more \nlike demons than followers of Our Saviour.\n\nNo real right to the crown, as you know, was in this King.  Edward \nMortimer, the young Earl of March - who was only eight or nine \nyears old, and who was descended from the Duke of Clarence, the \nelder brother of Henry\'s father - was, by succession, the real heir \nto the throne.  However, the King got his son declared Prince of \nWales; and, obtaining possession of the young Earl of March and his \nlittle brother, kept them in confinement (but not severely) in \nWindsor Castle.  He then required the Parliament to decide what was \nto be done with the deposed King, who was quiet enough, and who \nonly said that he hoped his cousin Henry would be \'a good lord\' to \nhim.  The Parliament replied that they would recommend his being \nkept in some secret place where the people could not resort, and \nwhere his friends could not be admitted to see him.  Henry \naccordingly passed this sentence upon him, and it now began to be \npretty clear to the nation that Richard the Second would not live \nvery long.\n\nIt was a noisy Parliament, as it was an unprincipled one, and the \nLords quarrelled so violently among themselves as to which of them \nhad been loyal and which disloyal, and which consistent and which \ninconsistent, that forty gauntlets are said to have been thrown \nupon the floor at one time as challenges to as many battles:  the \ntruth being that they were all false and base together, and had \nbeen, at one time with the old King, and at another time with the \nnew one, and seldom true for any length of time to any one.  They \nsoon began to plot again.  A conspiracy was formed to invite the \nKing to a tournament at Oxford, and then to take him by surprise \nand kill him.  This murderous enterprise, which was agreed upon at \nsecret meetings in the house of the Abbot of Westminster, was \nbetrayed by the Earl of Rutland - one of the conspirators.  The \nKing, instead of going to the tournament or staying at Windsor \n(where the conspirators suddenly went, on finding themselves \ndiscovered, with the hope of seizing him), retired to London, \nproclaimed them all traitors, and advanced upon them with a great \nforce.  They retired into the west of England, proclaiming Richard \nKing; but, the people rose against them, and they were all slain.  \nTheir treason hastened the death of the deposed monarch.  Whether \nhe was killed by hired assassins, or whether he was starved to \ndeath, or whether he refused food on hearing of his brothers being \nkilled (who were in that plot), is very doubtful.  He met his death \nsomehow; and his body was publicly shown at St. Paul\'s Cathedral \nwith only the lower part of the face uncovered.  I can scarcely \ndoubt that he was killed by the King\'s orders.\n\nThe French wife of the miserable Richard was now only ten years \nold; and, when her father, Charles of France, heard of her \nmisfortunes and of her lonely condition in England, he went mad:  \nas he had several times done before, during the last five or six \nyears.  The French Dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon took up the poor \ngirl\'s cause, without caring much about it, but on the chance of \ngetting something out of England.  The people of Bordeaux, who had \na sort of superstitious attachment to the memory of Richard, \nbecause he was born there, swore by the Lord that he had been the \nbest man in all his kingdom - which was going rather far - and \npromised to do great things against the English.  Nevertheless, \nwhen they came to consider that they, and the whole people of \nFrance, were ruined by their own nobles, and that the English rule \nwas much the better of the two, they cooled down again; and the two \ndukes, although they were very great men, could do nothing without \nthem.  Then, began negotiations between France and England for the \nsending home to Paris of the poor little Queen with all her jewels \nand her fortune of two hundred thousand francs in gold.  The King \nwas quite willing to restore the young lady, and even the jewels; \nbut he said he really could not part with the money.  So, at last \nshe was safely deposited at Paris without her fortune, and then the \nDuke of Burgundy (who was cousin to the French King) began to \nquarrel with the Duke of Orleans (who was brother to the French \nKing) about the whole matter; and those two dukes made France even \nmore wretched than ever.\n\nAs the idea of conquering Scotland was still popular at home, the \nKing marched to the river Tyne and demanded homage of the King of \nthat country.  This being refused, he advanced to Edinburgh, but \ndid little there; for, his army being in want of provisions, and \nthe Scotch being very careful to hold him in check without giving \nbattle, he was obliged to retire.  It is to his immortal honour \nthat in this sally he burnt no villages and slaughtered no people, \nbut was particularly careful that his army should be merciful and \nharmless.  It was a great example in those ruthless times.\n\nA war among the border people of England and Scotland went on for \ntwelve months, and then the Earl of Northumberland, the nobleman \nwho had helped Henry to the crown, began to rebel against him - \nprobably because nothing that Henry could do for him would satisfy \nhis extravagant expectations.  There was a certain Welsh gentleman, \nnamed OWEN GLENDOWER, who had been a student in one of the Inns of \nCourt, and had afterwards been in the service of the late King, \nwhose Welsh property was taken from him by a powerful lord related \nto the present King, who was his neighbour.  Appealing for redress, \nand getting none, he took up arms, was made an outlaw, and declared \nhimself sovereign of Wales.  He pretended to be a magician; and not \nonly were the Welsh people stupid enough to believe him, but, even \nHenry believed him too; for, making three expeditions into Wales, \nand being three times driven back by the wildness of the country, \nthe bad weather, and the skill of Glendower, he thought he was \ndefeated by the Welshman\'s magic arts.  However, he took Lord Grey \nand Sir Edmund Mortimer, prisoners, and allowed the relatives of \nLord Grey to ransom him, but would not extend such favour to Sir \nEdmund Mortimer.  Now, Henry Percy, called HOTSPUR, son of the Earl \nof Northumberland, who was married to Mortimer\'s sister, is \nsupposed to have taken offence at this; and, therefore, in \nconjunction with his father and some others, to have joined Owen \nGlendower, and risen against Henry.  It is by no means clear that \nthis was the real cause of the conspiracy; but perhaps it was made \nthe pretext.  It was formed, and was very powerful; including \nSCROOP, Archbishop of York, and the EARL OF DOUGLAS, a powerful and \nbrave Scottish nobleman.  The King was prompt and active, and the \ntwo armies met at Shrewsbury.\n\nThere were about fourteen thousand men in each.  The old Earl of \nNorthumberland being sick, the rebel forces were led by his son.  \nThe King wore plain armour to deceive the enemy; and four noblemen, \nwith the same object, wore the royal arms.  The rebel charge was so \nfurious, that every one of those gentlemen was killed, the royal \nstandard was beaten down, and the young Prince of Wales was \nseverely wounded in the face.  But he was one of the bravest and \nbest soldiers that ever lived, and he fought so well, and the \nKing\'s troops were so encouraged by his bold example, that they \nrallied immediately, and cut the enemy\'s forces all to pieces.  \nHotspur was killed by an arrow in the brain, and the rout was so \ncomplete that the whole rebellion was struck down by this one blow.  \nThe Earl of Northumberland surrendered himself soon after hearing \nof the death of his son, and received a pardon for all his \noffences.\n\nThere were some lingerings of rebellion yet:  Owen Glendower being \nretired to Wales, and a preposterous story being spread among the \nignorant people that King Richard was still alive.  How they could \nhave believed such nonsense it is difficult to imagine; but they \ncertainly did suppose that the Court fool of the late King, who was \nsomething like him, was he, himself; so that it seemed as if, after \ngiving so much trouble to the country in his life, he was still to \ntrouble it after his death.  This was not the worst.  The young \nEarl of March and his brother were stolen out of Windsor Castle.  \nBeing retaken, and being found to have been spirited away by one \nLady Spencer, she accused her own brother, that Earl of Rutland who \nwas in the former conspiracy and was now Duke of York, of being in \nthe plot.  For this he was ruined in fortune, though not put to \ndeath; and then another plot arose among the old Earl of \nNorthumberland, some other lords, and that same Scroop, Archbishop \nof York, who was with the rebels before.  These conspirators caused \na writing to be posted on the church doors, accusing the King of a \nvariety of crimes; but, the King being eager and vigilant to oppose \nthem, they were all taken, and the Archbishop was executed.  This \nwas the first time that a great churchman had been slain by the law \nin England; but the King was resolved that it should be done, and \ndone it was.\n\nThe next most remarkable event of this time was the seizure, by \nHenry, of the heir to the Scottish throne - James, a boy of nine \nyears old.  He had been put aboard-ship by his father, the Scottish \nKing Robert, to save him from the designs of his uncle, when, on \nhis way to France, he was accidentally taken by some English \ncruisers.  He remained a prisoner in England for nineteen years, \nand became in his prison a student and a famous poet.\n\nWith the exception of occasional troubles with the Welsh and with \nthe French, the rest of King Henry\'s reign was quiet enough.  But, \nthe King was far from happy, and probably was troubled in his \nconscience by knowing that he had usurped the crown, and had \noccasioned the death of his miserable cousin.  The Prince of Wales, \nthough brave and generous, is said to have been wild and \ndissipated, and even to have drawn his sword on GASCOIGNE, the \nChief Justice of the King\'s Bench, because he was firm in dealing \nimpartially with one of his dissolute companions.  Upon this the \nChief Justice is said to have ordered him immediately to prison; \nthe Prince of Wales is said to have submitted with a good grace; \nand the King is said to have exclaimed, \'Happy is the monarch who \nhas so just a judge, and a son so willing to obey the laws.\'  This \nis all very doubtful, and so is another story (of which Shakespeare \nhas made beautiful use), that the Prince once took the crown out of \nhis father\'s chamber as he was sleeping, and tried it on his own \nhead.\n\nThe King\'s health sank more and more, and he became subject to \nviolent eruptions on the face and to bad epileptic fits, and his \nspirits sank every day.  At last, as he was praying before the \nshrine of St. Edward at Westminster Abbey, he was seized with a \nterrible fit, and was carried into the Abbot\'s chamber, where he \npresently died.  It had been foretold that he would die at \nJerusalem, which certainly is not, and never was, Westminster.  \nBut, as the Abbot\'s room had long been called the Jerusalem \nchamber, people said it was all the same thing, and were quite \nsatisfied with the prediction.\n\nThe King died on the 20th of March, 1413, in the forty-seventh year \nof his age, and the fourteenth of his reign.  He was buried in \nCanterbury Cathedral.  He had been twice married, and had, by his \nfirst wife, a family of four sons and two daughters.  Considering \nhis duplicity before he came to the throne, his unjust seizure of \nit, and above all, his making that monstrous law for the burning of \nwhat the priests called heretics, he was a reasonably good king, as \nkings went.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIFTH\n\n\n\nFIRST PART\n\n\nTHE Prince of Wales began his reign like a generous and honest man.  \nHe set the young Earl of March free; he restored their estates and \ntheir honours to the Percy family, who had lost them by their \nrebellion against his father; he ordered the imbecile and \nunfortunate Richard to be honourably buried among the Kings of \nEngland; and he dismissed all his wild companions, with assurances \nthat they should not want, if they would resolve to be steady, \nfaithful, and true.\n\nIt is much easier to burn men than to burn their opinions; and \nthose of the Lollards were spreading every day.  The Lollards were \nrepresented by the priests - probably falsely for the most part - \nto entertain treasonable designs against the new King; and Henry, \nsuffering himself to be worked upon by these representations, \nsacrificed his friend Sir John Oldcastle, the Lord Cobham, to them, \nafter trying in vain to convert him by arguments.  He was declared \nguilty, as the head of the sect, and sentenced to the flames; but \nhe escaped from the Tower before the day of execution (postponed \nfor fifty days by the King himself), and summoned the Lollards to \nmeet him near London on a certain day.  So the priests told the \nKing, at least.  I doubt whether there was any conspiracy beyond \nsuch as was got up by their agents.  On the day appointed, instead \nof five-and-twenty thousand men, under the command of Sir John \nOldcastle, in the meadows of St. Giles, the King found only eighty \nmen, and no Sir John at all.  There was, in another place, an \naddle-headed brewer, who had gold trappings to his horses, and a \npair of gilt spurs in his breast - expecting to be made a knight \nnext day by Sir John, and so to gain the right to wear them - but \nthere was no Sir John, nor did anybody give information respecting \nhim, though the King offered great rewards for such intelligence.  \nThirty of these unfortunate Lollards were hanged and drawn \nimmediately, and were then burnt, gallows and all; and the various \nprisons in and around London were crammed full of others.  Some of \nthese unfortunate men made various confessions of treasonable \ndesigns; but, such confessions were easily got, under torture and \nthe fear of fire, and are very little to be trusted.  To finish the \nsad story of Sir John Oldcastle at once, I may mention that he \nescaped into Wales, and remained there safely, for four years.  \nWhen discovered by Lord Powis, it is very doubtful if he would have \nbeen taken alive - so great was the old soldier\'s bravery - if a \nmiserable old woman had not come behind him and broken his legs \nwith a stool.  He was carried to London in a horse-litter, was \nfastened by an iron chain to a gibbet, and so roasted to death.\n\nTo make the state of France as plain as I can in a few words, I \nshould tell you that the Duke of Orleans, and the Duke of Burgundy, \ncommonly called \'John without fear,\' had had a grand reconciliation \nof their quarrel in the last reign, and had appeared to be quite in \na heavenly state of mind.  Immediately after which, on a Sunday, in \nthe public streets of Paris, the Duke of Orleans was murdered by a \nparty of twenty men, set on by the Duke of Burgundy - according to \nhis own deliberate confession.  The widow of King Richard had been \nmarried in France to the eldest son of the Duke of Orleans.  The \npoor mad King was quite powerless to help her, and the Duke of \nBurgundy became the real master of France.  Isabella dying, her \nhusband (Duke of Orleans since the death of his father) married the \ndaughter of the Count of Armagnac, who, being a much abler man than \nhis young son-in-law, headed his party; thence called after him \nArmagnacs.  Thus, France was now in this terrible condition, that \nit had in it the party of the King\'s son, the Dauphin Louis; the \nparty of the Duke of Burgundy, who was the father of the Dauphin\'s \nill-used wife; and the party of the Armagnacs; all hating each \nother; all fighting together; all composed of the most depraved \nnobles that the earth has ever known; and all tearing unhappy \nFrance to pieces.\n\nThe late King had watched these dissensions from England, sensible \n(like the French people) that no enemy of France could injure her \nmore than her own nobility.  The present King now advanced a claim \nto the French throne.  His demand being, of course, refused, he \nreduced his proposal to a certain large amount of French territory, \nand to demanding the French princess, Catherine, in marriage, with \na fortune of two millions of golden crowns.  He was offered less \nterritory and fewer crowns, and no princess; but he called his \nambassadors home and prepared for war.  Then, he proposed to take \nthe princess with one million of crowns.  The French Court replied \nthat he should have the princess with two hundred thousand crowns \nless; he said this would not do (he had never seen the princess in \nhis life), and assembled his army at Southampton.  There was a \nshort plot at home just at that time, for deposing him, and making \nthe Earl of March king; but the conspirators were all speedily \ncondemned and executed, and the King embarked for France.\n\nIt is dreadful to observe how long a bad example will be followed; \nbut, it is encouraging to know that a good example is never thrown \naway.  The King\'s first act on disembarking at the mouth of the \nriver Seine, three miles from Harfleur, was to imitate his father, \nand to proclaim his solemn orders that the lives and property of \nthe peaceable inhabitants should be respected on pain of death.  It \nis agreed by French writers, to his lasting renown, that even while \nhis soldiers were suffering the greatest distress from want of \nfood, these commands were rigidly obeyed.\n\nWith an army in all of thirty thousand men, he besieged the town of \nHarfleur both by sea and land for five weeks; at the end of which \ntime the town surrendered, and the inhabitants were allowed to \ndepart with only fivepence each, and a part of their clothes.  All \nthe rest of their possessions was divided amongst the English army.  \nBut, that army suffered so much, in spite of its successes, from \ndisease and privation, that it was already reduced one half.  \nStill, the King was determined not to retire until he had struck a \ngreater blow.  Therefore, against the advice of all his \ncounsellors, he moved on with his little force towards Calais.  \nWhen he came up to the river Somme he was unable to cross, in \nconsequence of the fort being fortified; and, as the English moved \nup the left bank of the river looking for a crossing, the French, \nwho had broken all the bridges, moved up the right bank, watching \nthem, and waiting to attack them when they should try to pass it.  \nAt last the English found a crossing and got safely over.  The \nFrench held a council of war at Rouen, resolved to give the English \nbattle, and sent heralds to King Henry to know by which road he was \ngoing.  \'By the road that will take me straight to Calais!\' said \nthe King, and sent them away with a present of a hundred crowns.\n\nThe English moved on, until they beheld the French, and then the \nKing gave orders to form in line of battle.  The French not coming \non, the army broke up after remaining in battle array till night, \nand got good rest and refreshment at a neighbouring village.  The \nFrench were now all lying in another village, through which they \nknew the English must pass.  They were resolved that the English \nshould begin the battle.  The English had no means of retreat, if \ntheir King had any such intention; and so the two armies passed the \nnight, close together.\n\nTo understand these armies well, you must bear in mind that the \nimmense French army had, among its notable persons, almost the \nwhole of that wicked nobility, whose debauchery had made France a \ndesert; and so besotted were they by pride, and by contempt for the \ncommon people, that they had scarcely any bowmen (if indeed they \nhad any at all) in their whole enormous number:  which, compared \nwith the English army, was at least as six to one.  For these proud \nfools had said that the bow was not a fit weapon for knightly \nhands, and that France must be defended by gentlemen only.  We \nshall see, presently, what hand the gentlemen made of it.\n\nNow, on the English side, among the little force, there was a good \nproportion of men who were not gentlemen by any means, but who were \ngood stout archers for all that.  Among them, in the morning - \nhaving slept little at night, while the French were carousing and \nmaking sure of victory - the King rode, on a grey horse; wearing on \nhis head a helmet of shining steel, surmounted by a crown of gold, \nsparkling with precious stones; and bearing over his armour, \nembroidered together, the arms of England and the arms of France.  \nThe archers looked at the shining helmet and the crown of gold and \nthe sparkling jewels, and admired them all; but, what they admired \nmost was the King\'s cheerful face, and his bright blue eye, as he \ntold them that, for himself, he had made up his mind to conquer \nthere or to die there, and that England should never have a ransom \nto pay for HIM.  There was one brave knight who chanced to say that \nhe wished some of the many gallant gentlemen and good soldiers, who \nwere then idle at home in England, were there to increase their \nnumbers.  But the King told him that, for his part, he did not wish \nfor one more man.  \'The fewer we have,\' said he, \'the greater will \nbe the honour we shall win!\'  His men, being now all in good heart, \nwere refreshed with bread and wine, and heard prayers, and waited \nquietly for the French.  The King waited for the French, because \nthey were drawn up thirty deep (the little English force was only \nthree deep), on very difficult and heavy ground; and he knew that \nwhen they moved, there must be confusion among them.\n\nAs they did not move, he sent off two parties:- one to lie \nconcealed in a wood on the left of the French:  the other, to set \nfire to some houses behind the French after the battle should be \nbegun.  This was scarcely done, when three of the proud French \ngentlemen, who were to defend their country without any help from \nthe base peasants, came riding out, calling upon the English to \nsurrender.  The King warned those gentlemen himself to retire with \nall speed if they cared for their lives, and ordered the English \nbanners to advance.  Upon that, Sir Thomas Erpingham, a great \nEnglish general, who commanded the archers, threw his truncheon \ninto the air, joyfully, and all the English men, kneeling down upon \nthe ground and biting it as if they took possession of the country, \nrose up with a great shout and fell upon the French.\n\nEvery archer was furnished with a great stake tipped with iron; and \nhis orders were, to thrust this stake into the ground, to discharge \nhis arrow, and then to fall back, when the French horsemen came on.  \nAs the haughty French gentlemen, who were to break the English \narchers and utterly destroy them with their knightly lances, came \nriding up, they were received with such a blinding storm of arrows, \nthat they broke and turned.  Horses and men rolled over one \nanother, and the confusion was terrific.  Those who rallied and \ncharged the archers got among the stakes on slippery and boggy \nground, and were so bewildered that the English archers - who wore \nno armour, and even took off their leathern coats to be more active \n- cut them to pieces, root and branch.  Only three French horsemen \ngot within the stakes, and those were instantly despatched.  All \nthis time the dense French army, being in armour, were sinking \nknee-deep into the mire; while the light English archers, half-\nnaked, were as fresh and active as if they were fighting on a \nmarble floor.\n\nBut now, the second division of the French coming to the relief of \nthe first, closed up in a firm mass; the English, headed by the \nKing, attacked them; and the deadliest part of the battle began.  \nThe King\'s brother, the Duke of Clarence, was struck down, and \nnumbers of the French surrounded him; but, King Henry, standing \nover the body, fought like a lion until they were beaten off.\n\nPresently, came up a band of eighteen French knights, bearing the \nbanner of a certain French lord, who had sworn to kill or take the \nEnglish King.  One of them struck him such a blow with a battle-axe \nthat he reeled and fell upon his knees; but, his faithful men, \nimmediately closing round him, killed every one of those eighteen \nknights, and so that French lord never kept his oath.\n\nThe French Duke of Alenáon, seeing this, made a desperate charge, \nand cut his way close up to the Royal Standard of England.  He beat \ndown the Duke of York, who was standing near it; and, when the King \ncame to his rescue, struck off a piece of the crown he wore.  But, \nhe never struck another blow in this world; for, even as he was in \nthe act of saying who he was, and that he surrendered to the King; \nand even as the King stretched out his hand to give him a safe and \nhonourable acceptance of the offer; he fell dead, pierced by \ninnumerable wounds.\n\nThe death of this nobleman decided the battle.  The third division \nof the French army, which had never struck a blow yet, and which \nwas, in itself, more than double the whole English power, broke and \nfled.  At this time of the fight, the English, who as yet had made \nno prisoners, began to take them in immense numbers, and were still \noccupied in doing so, or in killing those who would not surrender, \nwhen a great noise arose in the rear of the French - their flying \nbanners were seen to stop - and King Henry, supposing a great \nreinforcement to have arrived, gave orders that all the prisoners \nshould be put to death.  As soon, however, as it was found that the \nnoise was only occasioned by a body of plundering peasants, the \nterrible massacre was stopped.\n\nThen King Henry called to him the French herald, and asked him to \nwhom the victory belonged.\n\nThe herald replied, \'To the King of England.\'\n\n\'WE have not made this havoc and slaughter,\' said the King.  \'It is \nthe wrath of Heaven on the sins of France.  What is the name of \nthat castle yonder?\'\n\nThe herald answered him, \'My lord, it is the castle of Azincourt.\'  \nSaid the King, \'From henceforth this battle shall be known to \nposterity, by the name of the battle of Azincourt.\'\n\nOur English historians have made it Agincourt; but, under that \nname, it will ever be famous in English annals.\n\nThe loss upon the French side was enormous.  Three Dukes were \nkilled, two more were taken prisoners, seven Counts were killed, \nthree more were taken prisoners, and ten thousand knights and \ngentlemen were slain upon the field.  The English loss amounted to \nsixteen hundred men, among whom were the Duke of York and the Earl \nof Suffolk.\n\nWar is a dreadful thing; and it is appalling to know how the \nEnglish were obliged, next morning, to kill those prisoners \nmortally wounded, who yet writhed in agony upon the ground; how the \ndead upon the French side were stripped by their own countrymen and \ncountrywomen, and afterwards buried in great pits; how the dead \nupon the English side were piled up in a great barn, and how their \nbodies and the barn were all burned together.  It is in such \nthings, and in many more much too horrible to relate, that the real \ndesolation and wickedness of war consist.  Nothing can make war \notherwise than horrible.  But the dark side of it was little \nthought of and soon forgotten; and it cast no shade of trouble on \nthe English people, except on those who had lost friends or \nrelations in the fight.  They welcomed their King home with shouts \nof rejoicing, and plunged into the water to bear him ashore on \ntheir shoulders, and flocked out in crowds to welcome him in every \ntown through which he passed, and hung rich carpets and tapestries \nout of the windows, and strewed the streets with flowers, and made \nthe fountains run with wine, as the great field of Agincourt had \nrun with blood.\n\n\nSECOND PART\n\n\nTHAT proud and wicked French nobility who dragged their country to \ndestruction, and who were every day and every year regarded with \ndeeper hatred and detestation in the hearts of the French people, \nlearnt nothing, even from the defeat of Agincourt.  So far from \nuniting against the common enemy, they became, among themselves, \nmore violent, more bloody, and more false - if that were possible - \nthan they had been before.  The Count of Armagnac persuaded the \nFrench king to plunder of her treasures Queen Isabella of Bavaria, \nand to make her a prisoner.  She, who had hitherto been the bitter \nenemy of the Duke of Burgundy, proposed to join him, in revenge.  \nHe carried her off to Troyes, where she proclaimed herself Regent \nof France, and made him her lieutenant.  The Armagnac party were at \nthat time possessed of Paris; but, one of the gates of the city \nbeing secretly opened on a certain night to a party of the duke\'s \nmen, they got into Paris, threw into the prisons all the Armagnacs \nupon whom they could lay their hands, and, a few nights afterwards, \nwith the aid of a furious mob of sixty thousand people, broke the \nprisons open, and killed them all.  The former Dauphin was now \ndead, and the King\'s third son bore the title.  Him, in the height \nof this murderous scene, a French knight hurried out of bed, \nwrapped in a sheet, and bore away to Poitiers.  So, when the \nrevengeful Isabella and the Duke of Burgundy entered Paris in \ntriumph after the slaughter of their enemies, the Dauphin was \nproclaimed at Poitiers as the real Regent.\n\nKing Henry had not been idle since his victory of Agincourt, but \nhad repulsed a brave attempt of the French to recover Harfleur; had \ngradually conquered a great part of Normandy; and, at this crisis \nof affairs, took the important town of Rouen, after a siege of half \na year.  This great loss so alarmed the French, that the Duke of \nBurgundy proposed that a meeting to treat of peace should be held \nbetween the French and the English kings in a plain by the river \nSeine.  On the appointed day, King Henry appeared there, with his \ntwo brothers, Clarence and Gloucester, and a thousand men.  The \nunfortunate French King, being more mad than usual that day, could \nnot come; but the Queen came, and with her the Princess Catherine:  \nwho was a very lovely creature, and who made a real impression on \nKing Henry, now that he saw her for the first time.  This was the \nmost important circumstance that arose out of the meeting.\n\nAs if it were impossible for a French nobleman of that time to be \ntrue to his word of honour in anything, Henry discovered that the \nDuke of Burgundy was, at that very moment, in secret treaty with \nthe Dauphin; and he therefore abandoned the negotiation.\n\nThe Duke of Burgundy and the Dauphin, each of whom with the best \nreason distrusted the other as a noble ruffian surrounded by a \nparty of noble ruffians, were rather at a loss how to proceed after \nthis; but, at length they agreed to meet, on a bridge over the \nriver Yonne, where it was arranged that there should be two strong \ngates put up, with an empty space between them; and that the Duke \nof Burgundy should come into that space by one gate, with ten men \nonly; and that the Dauphin should come into that space by the other \ngate, also with ten men, and no more.\n\nSo far the Dauphin kept his word, but no farther.  When the Duke of \nBurgundy was on his knee before him in the act of speaking, one of \nthe Dauphin\'s noble ruffians cut the said duke down with a small \naxe, and others speedily finished him.\n\nIt was in vain for the Dauphin to pretend that this base murder was \nnot done with his consent; it was too bad, even for France, and \ncaused a general horror.  The duke\'s heir hastened to make a treaty \nwith King Henry, and the French Queen engaged that her husband \nshould consent to it, whatever it was.  Henry made peace, on \ncondition of receiving the Princess Catherine in marriage, and \nbeing made Regent of France during the rest of the King\'s lifetime, \nand succeeding to the French crown at his death.  He was soon \nmarried to the beautiful Princess, and took her proudly home to \nEngland, where she was crowned with great honour and glory.\n\nThis peace was called the Perpetual Peace; we shall soon see how \nlong it lasted.  It gave great satisfaction to the French people, \nalthough they were so poor and miserable, that, at the time of the \ncelebration of the Royal marriage, numbers of them were dying with \nstarvation, on the dunghills in the streets of Paris.  There was \nsome resistance on the part of the Dauphin in some few parts of \nFrance, but King Henry beat it all down.\n\nAnd now, with his great possessions in France secured, and his \nbeautiful wife to cheer him, and a son born to give him greater \nhappiness, all appeared bright before him.  But, in the fulness of \nhis triumph and the height of his power, Death came upon him, and \nhis day was done.  When he fell ill at Vincennes, and found that he \ncould not recover, he was very calm and quiet, and spoke serenely \nto those who wept around his bed.  His wife and child, he said, he \nleft to the loving care of his brother the Duke of Bedford, and his \nother faithful nobles.  He gave them his advice that England should \nestablish a friendship with the new Duke of Burgundy, and offer him \nthe regency of France; that it should not set free the royal \nprinces who had been taken at Agincourt; and that, whatever quarrel \nmight arise with France, England should never make peace without \nholding Normandy.  Then, he laid down his head, and asked the \nattendant priests to chant the penitential psalms.  Amid which \nsolemn sounds, on the thirty-first of August, one thousand four \nhundred and twenty-two, in only the thirty-fourth year of his age \nand the tenth of his reign, King Henry the Fifth passed away.\n\nSlowly and mournfully they carried his embalmed body in a \nprocession of great state to Paris, and thence to Rouen where his \nQueen was:  from whom the sad intelligence of his death was \nconcealed until he had been dead some days.  Thence, lying on a bed \nof crimson and gold, with a golden crown upon the head, and a \ngolden ball and sceptre lying in the nerveless hands, they carried \nit to Calais, with such a great retinue as seemed to dye the road \nblack.  The King of Scotland acted as chief mourner, all the Royal \nHousehold followed, the knights wore black armour and black plumes \nof feathers, crowds of men bore torches, making the night as light \nas day; and the widowed Princess followed last of all.  At Calais \nthere was a fleet of ships to bring the funeral host to Dover.  And \nso, by way of London Bridge, where the service for the dead was \nchanted as it passed along, they brought the body to Westminster \nAbbey, and there buried it with great respect.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SIXTH\n\n\n\nPART THE FIRST\n\n\nIT had been the wish of the late King, that while his infant son \nKING HENRY THE SIXTH, at this time only nine months old, was under \nage, the Duke of Gloucester should be appointed Regent.  The \nEnglish Parliament, however, preferred to appoint a Council of \nRegency, with the Duke of Bedford at its head:  to be represented, \nin his absence only, by the Duke of Gloucester.  The Parliament \nwould seem to have been wise in this, for Gloucester soon showed \nhimself to be ambitious and troublesome, and, in the gratification \nof his own personal schemes, gave dangerous offence to the Duke of \nBurgundy, which was with difficulty adjusted.\n\nAs that duke declined the Regency of France, it was bestowed by the \npoor French King upon the Duke of Bedford.  But, the French King \ndying within two months, the Dauphin instantly asserted his claim \nto the French throne, and was actually crowned under the title of \nCHARLES THE SEVENTH.  The Duke of Bedford, to be a match for him, \nentered into a friendly league with the Dukes of Burgundy and \nBrittany, and gave them his two sisters in marriage.  War with \nFrance was immediately renewed, and the Perpetual Peace came to an \nuntimely end.\n\nIn the first campaign, the English, aided by this alliance, were \nspeedily successful.  As Scotland, however, had sent the French \nfive thousand men, and might send more, or attack the North of \nEngland while England was busy with France, it was considered that \nit would be a good thing to offer the Scottish King, James, who had \nbeen so long imprisoned, his liberty, on his paying forty thousand \npounds for his board and lodging during nineteen years, and \nengaging to forbid his subjects from serving under the flag of \nFrance.  It is pleasant to know, not only that the amiable captive \nat last regained his freedom upon these terms, but, that he married \na noble English lady, with whom he had been long in love, and \nbecame an excellent King.  I am afraid we have met with some Kings \nin this history, and shall meet with some more, who would have been \nvery much the better, and would have left the world much happier, \nif they had been imprisoned nineteen years too.\n\nIn the second campaign, the English gained a considerable victory \nat Verneuil, in a battle which was chiefly remarkable, otherwise, \nfor their resorting to the odd expedient of tying their baggage-\nhorses together by the heads and tails, and jumbling them up with \nthe baggage, so as to convert them into a sort of live \nfortification - which was found useful to the troops, but which I \nshould think was not agreeable to the horses.  For three years \nafterwards very little was done, owing to both sides being too poor \nfor war, which is a very expensive entertainment; but, a council \nwas then held in Paris, in which it was decided to lay siege to the \ntown of Orleans, which was a place of great importance to the \nDauphin\'s cause.  An English army of ten thousand men was \ndespatched on this service, under the command of the Earl of \nSalisbury, a general of fame.  He being unfortunately killed early \nin the siege, the Earl of Suffolk took his place; under whom \n(reinforced by SIR JOHN FALSTAFF, who brought up four hundred \nwaggons laden with salt herrings and other provisions for the \ntroops, and, beating off the French who tried to intercept him, \ncame victorious out of a hot skirmish, which was afterwards called \nin jest the Battle of the Herrings) the town of Orleans was so \ncompletely hemmed in, that the besieged proposed to yield it up to \ntheir countryman the Duke of Burgundy.  The English general, \nhowever, replied that his English men had won it, so far, by their \nblood and valour, and that his English men must have it.  There \nseemed to be no hope for the town, or for the Dauphin, who was so \ndismayed that he even thought of flying to Scotland or to Spain - \nwhen a peasant girl rose up and changed the whole state of affairs.\n\nThe story of this peasant girl I have now to tell.\n\n\nPART THE SECOND:  THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC\n\n\nIN a remote village among some wild hills in the province of \nLorraine, there lived a countryman whose name was JACQUES D\'ARC.  \nHe had a daughter, JOAN OF ARC, who was at this time in her \ntwentieth year.  She had been a solitary girl from her childhood; \nshe had often tended sheep and cattle for whole days where no human \nfigure was seen or human voice heard; and she had often knelt, for \nhours together, in the gloomy, empty, little village chapel, \nlooking up at the altar and at the dim lamp burning before it, \nuntil she fancied that she saw shadowy figures standing there, and \neven that she heard them speak to her.  The people in that part of \nFrance were very ignorant and superstitious, and they had many \nghostly tales to tell about what they had dreamed, and what they \nsaw among the lonely hills when the clouds and the mists were \nresting on them.  So, they easily believed that Joan saw strange \nsights, and they whispered among themselves that angels and spirits \ntalked to her.\n\nAt last, Joan told her father that she had one day been surprised \nby a great unearthly light, and had afterwards heard a solemn \nvoice, which said it was Saint Michael\'s voice, telling her that \nshe was to go and help the Dauphin.  Soon after this (she said), \nSaint Catherine and Saint Margaret had appeared to her with \nsparkling crowns upon their heads, and had encouraged her to be \nvirtuous and resolute.  These visions had returned sometimes; but \nthe Voices very often; and the voices always said, \'Joan, thou art \nappointed by Heaven to go and help the Dauphin!\'  She almost always \nheard them while the chapel bells were ringing.\n\nThere is no doubt, now, that Joan believed she saw and heard these \nthings.  It is very well known that such delusions are a disease \nwhich is not by any means uncommon.  It is probable enough that \nthere were figures of Saint Michael, and Saint Catherine, and Saint \nMargaret, in the little chapel (where they would be very likely to \nhave shining crowns upon their heads), and that they first gave \nJoan the idea of those three personages.  She had long been a \nmoping, fanciful girl, and, though she was a very good girl, I dare \nsay she was a little vain, and wishful for notoriety.\n\nHer father, something wiser than his neighbours, said, \'I tell \nthee, Joan, it is thy fancy.  Thou hadst better have a kind husband \nto take care of thee, girl, and work to employ thy mind!\'  But Joan \ntold him in reply, that she had taken a vow never to have a \nhusband, and that she must go as Heaven directed her, to help the \nDauphin.\n\nIt happened, unfortunately for her father\'s persuasions, and most \nunfortunately for the poor girl, too, that a party of the Dauphin\'s \nenemies found their way into the village while Joan\'s disorder was \nat this point, and burnt the chapel, and drove out the inhabitants.  \nThe cruelties she saw committed, touched Joan\'s heart and made her \nworse.  She said that the voices and the figures were now \ncontinually with her; that they told her she was the girl who, \naccording to an old prophecy, was to deliver France; and she must \ngo and help the Dauphin, and must remain with him until he should \nbe crowned at Rheims:  and that she must travel a long way to a \ncertain lord named BAUDRICOURT, who could and would, bring her into \nthe Dauphin\'s presence.\n\nAs her father still said, \'I tell thee, Joan, it is thy fancy,\' she \nset off to find out this lord, accompanied by an uncle, a poor \nvillage wheelwright and cart-maker, who believed in the reality of \nher visions.  They travelled a long way and went on and on, over a \nrough country, full of the Duke of Burgundy\'s men, and of all kinds \nof robbers and marauders, until they came to where this lord was.\n\nWhen his servants told him that there was a poor peasant girl named \nJoan of Arc, accompanied by nobody but an old village wheelwright \nand cart-maker, who wished to see him because she was commanded to \nhelp the Dauphin and save France, Baudricourt burst out a-laughing, \nand bade them send the girl away.  But, he soon heard so much about \nher lingering in the town, and praying in the churches, and seeing \nvisions, and doing harm to no one, that he sent for her, and \nquestioned her.  As she said the same things after she had been \nwell sprinkled with holy water as she had said before the \nsprinkling, Baudricourt began to think there might be something in \nit.  At all events, he thought it worth while to send her on to the \ntown of Chinon, where the Dauphin was.  So, he bought her a horse, \nand a sword, and gave her two squires to conduct her.  As the \nVoices had told Joan that she was to wear a man\'s dress, now, she \nput one on, and girded her sword to her side, and bound spurs to \nher heels, and mounted her horse and rode away with her two \nsquires.  As to her uncle the wheelwright, he stood staring at his \nniece in wonder until she was out of sight - as well he might - and \nthen went home again.  The best place, too.\n\nJoan and her two squires rode on and on, until they came to Chinon, \nwhere she was, after some doubt, admitted into the Dauphin\'s \npresence.  Picking him out immediately from all his court, she told \nhim that she came commanded by Heaven to subdue his enemies and \nconduct him to his coronation at Rheims.  She also told him (or he \npretended so afterwards, to make the greater impression upon his \nsoldiers) a number of his secrets known only to himself, and, \nfurthermore, she said there was an old, old sword in the cathedral \nof Saint Catherine at Fierbois, marked with five old crosses on the \nblade, which Saint Catherine had ordered her to wear.\n\nNow, nobody knew anything about this old, old sword, but when the \ncathedral came to be examined - which was immediately done - there, \nsure enough, the sword was found!  The Dauphin then required a \nnumber of grave priests and bishops to give him their opinion \nwhether the girl derived her power from good spirits or from evil \nspirits, which they held prodigiously long debates about, in the \ncourse of which several learned men fell fast asleep and snored \nloudly.  At last, when one gruff old gentleman had said to Joan, \n\'What language do your Voices speak?\' and when Joan had replied to \nthe gruff old gentleman, \'A pleasanter language than yours,\' they \nagreed that it was all correct, and that Joan of Arc was inspired \nfrom Heaven.  This wonderful circumstance put new heart into the \nDauphin\'s soldiers when they heard of it, and dispirited the \nEnglish army, who took Joan for a witch.\n\nSo Joan mounted horse again, and again rode on and on, until she \ncame to Orleans.  But she rode now, as never peasant girl had \nridden yet.  She rode upon a white war-horse, in a suit of \nglittering armour; with the old, old sword from the cathedral, \nnewly burnished, in her belt; with a white flag carried before her, \nupon which were a picture of God, and the words JESUS MARIA.  In \nthis splendid state, at the head of a great body of troops \nescorting provisions of all kinds for the starving inhabitants of \nOrleans, she appeared before that beleaguered city.\n\nWhen the people on the walls beheld her, they cried out \'The Maid \nis come!  The Maid of the Prophecy is come to deliver us!\'  And \nthis, and the sight of the Maid fighting at the head of their men, \nmade the French so bold, and made the English so fearful, that the \nEnglish line of forts was soon broken, the troops and provisions \nwere got into the town, and Orleans was saved.\n\nJoan, henceforth called THE MAID OF ORLEANS, remained within the \nwalls for a few days, and caused letters to be thrown over, \nordering Lord Suffolk and his Englishmen to depart from before the \ntown according to the will of Heaven.  As the English general very \npositively declined to believe that Joan knew anything about the \nwill of Heaven (which did not mend the matter with his soldiers, \nfor they stupidly said if she were not inspired she was a witch, \nand it was of no use to fight against a witch), she mounted her \nwhite war-horse again, and ordered her white banner to advance.\n\nThe besiegers held the bridge, and some strong towers upon the \nbridge; and here the Maid of Orleans attacked them.  The fight was \nfourteen hours long.  She planted a scaling ladder with her own \nhands, and mounted a tower wall, but was struck by an English arrow \nin the neck, and fell into the trench.  She was carried away and \nthe arrow was taken out, during which operation she screamed and \ncried with the pain, as any other girl might have done; but \npresently she said that the Voices were speaking to her and \nsoothing her to rest.  After a while, she got up, and was again \nforemost in the fight.  When the English who had seen her fall and \nsupposed her dead, saw this, they were troubled with the strangest \nfears, and some of them cried out that they beheld Saint Michael on \na white horse (probably Joan herself) fighting for the French.  \nThey lost the bridge, and lost the towers, and next day set their \nchain of forts on fire, and left the place.\n\nBut as Lord Suffolk himself retired no farther than the town of \nJargeau, which was only a few miles off, the Maid of Orleans \nbesieged him there, and he was taken prisoner.  As the white banner \nscaled the wall, she was struck upon the head with a stone, and was \nagain tumbled down into the ditch; but, she only cried all the \nmore, as she lay there, \'On, on, my countrymen!  And fear nothing, \nfor the Lord hath delivered them into our hands!\'  After this new \nsuccess of the Maid\'s, several other fortresses and places which \nhad previously held out against the Dauphin were delivered up \nwithout a battle; and at Patay she defeated the remainder of the \nEnglish army, and set up her victorious white banner on a field \nwhere twelve hundred Englishmen lay dead.\n\nShe now urged the Dauphin (who always kept out of the way when \nthere was any fighting) to proceed to Rheims, as the first part of \nher mission was accomplished; and to complete the whole by being \ncrowned there.  The Dauphin was in no particular hurry to do this, \nas Rheims was a long way off, and the English and the Duke of \nBurgundy were still strong in the country through which the road \nlay.  However, they set forth, with ten thousand men, and again the \nMaid of Orleans rode on and on, upon her white war-horse, and in \nher shining armour.  Whenever they came to a town which yielded \nreadily, the soldiers believed in her; but, whenever they came to a \ntown which gave them any trouble, they began to murmur that she was \nan impostor.  The latter was particularly the case at Troyes, which \nfinally yielded, however, through the persuasion of one Richard, a \nfriar of the place.  Friar Richard was in the old doubt about the \nMaid of Orleans, until he had sprinkled her well with holy water, \nand had also well sprinkled the threshold of the gate by which she \ncame into the city.  Finding that it made no change in her or the \ngate, he said, as the other grave old gentlemen had said, that it \nwas all right, and became her great ally.\n\nSo, at last, by dint of riding on and on, the Maid of Orleans, and \nthe Dauphin, and the ten thousand sometimes believing and sometimes \nunbelieving men, came to Rheims.  And in the great cathedral of \nRheims, the Dauphin actually was crowned Charles the Seventh in a \ngreat assembly of the people.  Then, the Maid, who with her white \nbanner stood beside the King in that hour of his triumph, kneeled \ndown upon the pavement at his feet, and said, with tears, that what \nshe had been inspired to do, was done, and that the only recompense \nshe asked for, was, that she should now have leave to go back to \nher distant home, and her sturdily incredulous father, and her \nfirst simple escort the village wheelwright and cart-maker.  But \nthe King said \'No!\' and made her and her family as noble as a King \ncould, and settled upon her the income of a Count.\n\nAh! happy had it been for the Maid of Orleans, if she had resumed \nher rustic dress that day, and had gone home to the little chapel \nand the wild hills, and had forgotten all these things, and had \nbeen a good man\'s wife, and had heard no stranger voices than the \nvoices of little children!\n\nIt was not to be, and she continued helping the King (she did a \nworld for him, in alliance with Friar Richard), and trying to \nimprove the lives of the coarse soldiers, and leading a religious, \nan unselfish, and a modest life, herself, beyond any doubt.  Still, \nmany times she prayed the King to let her go home; and once she \neven took off her bright armour and hung it up in a church, meaning \nnever to wear it more.  But, the King always won her back again - \nwhile she was of any use to him - and so she went on and on and on, \nto her doom.\n\nWhen the Duke of Bedford, who was a very able man, began to be \nactive for England, and, by bringing the war back into France and \nby holding the Duke of Burgundy to his faith, to distress and \ndisturb Charles very much, Charles sometimes asked the Maid of \nOrleans what the Voices said about it?  But, the Voices had become \n(very like ordinary voices in perplexed times) contradictory and \nconfused, so that now they said one thing, and now said another, \nand the Maid lost credit every day.  Charles marched on Paris, \nwhich was opposed to him, and attacked the suburb of Saint Honore.  \nIn this fight, being again struck down into the ditch, she was \nabandoned by the whole army.  She lay unaided among a heap of dead, \nand crawled out how she could.  Then, some of her believers went \nover to an opposition Maid, Catherine of La Rochelle, who said she \nwas inspired to tell where there were treasures of buried money - \nthough she never did - and then Joan accidentally broke the old, \nold sword, and others said that her power was broken with it.  \nFinally, at the siege of Compiägne, held by the Duke of Burgundy, \nwhere she did valiant service, she was basely left alone in a \nretreat, though facing about and fighting to the last; and an \narcher pulled her off her horse.\n\nO the uproar that was made, and the thanksgivings that were sung, \nabout the capture of this one poor country-girl!  O the way in \nwhich she was demanded to be tried for sorcery and heresy, and \nanything else you like, by the Inquisitor-General of France, and by \nthis great man, and by that great man, until it is wearisome to \nthink of! She was bought at last by the Bishop of Beauvais for ten \nthousand francs, and was shut up in her narrow prison:  plain Joan \nof Arc again, and Maid of Orleans no more.\n\nI should never have done if I were to tell you how they had Joan \nout to examine her, and cross-examine her, and re-examine her, and \nworry her into saying anything and everything; and how all sorts of \nscholars and doctors bestowed their utmost tediousness upon her.  \nSixteen times she was brought out and shut up again, and worried, \nand entrapped, and argued with, until she was heart-sick of the \ndreary business.  On the last occasion of this kind she was brought \ninto a burial-place at Rouen, dismally decorated with a scaffold, \nand a stake and faggots, and the executioner, and a pulpit with a \nfriar therein, and an awful sermon ready.  It is very affecting to \nknow that even at that pass the poor girl honoured the mean vermin \nof a King, who had so used her for his purposes and so abandoned \nher; and, that while she had been regardless of reproaches heaped \nupon herself, she spoke out courageously for him.\n\nIt was natural in one so young to hold to life.  To save her life, \nshe signed a declaration prepared for her - signed it with a cross, \nfor she couldn\'t write - that all her visions and Voices had come \nfrom the Devil.  Upon her recanting the past, and protesting that \nshe would never wear a man\'s dress in future, she was condemned to \nimprisonment for life, \'on the bread of sorrow and the water of \naffliction.\'\n\nBut, on the bread of sorrow and the water of affliction, the \nvisions and the Voices soon returned.  It was quite natural that \nthey should do so, for that kind of disease is much aggravated by \nfasting, loneliness, and anxiety of mind.  It was not only got out \nof Joan that she considered herself inspired again, but, she was \ntaken in a man\'s dress, which had been left - to entrap her - in \nher prison, and which she put on, in her solitude; perhaps, in \nremembrance of her past glories, perhaps, because the imaginary \nVoices told her.  For this relapse into the sorcery and heresy and \nanything else you like, she was sentenced to be burnt to death.  \nAnd, in the market-place of Rouen, in the hideous dress which the \nmonks had invented for such spectacles; with priests and bishops \nsitting in a gallery looking on, though some had the Christian \ngrace to go away, unable to endure the infamous scene; this \nshrieking girl - last seen amidst the smoke and fire, holding a \ncrucifix between her hands; last heard, calling upon Christ - was \nburnt to ashes.  They threw her ashes into the river Seine; but \nthey will rise against her murderers on the last day.\n\nFrom the moment of her capture, neither the French King nor one \nsingle man in all his court raised a finger to save her.  It is no \ndefence of them that they may have never really believed in her, or \nthat they may have won her victories by their skill and bravery.  \nThe more they pretended to believe in her, the more they had caused \nher to believe in herself; and she had ever been true to them, ever \nbrave, ever nobly devoted.  But, it is no wonder, that they, who \nwere in all things false to themselves, false to one another, false \nto their country, false to Heaven, false to Earth, should be \nmonsters of ingratitude and treachery to a helpless peasant girl.\n\nIn the picturesque old town of Rouen, where weeds and grass grow \nhigh on the cathedral towers, and the venerable Norman streets are \nstill warm in the blessed sunlight though the monkish fires that \nonce gleamed horribly upon them have long grown cold, there is a \nstatue of Joan of Arc, in the scene of her last agony, the square \nto which she has given its present name.  I know some statues of \nmodern times - even in the World\'s metropolis, I think - which \ncommemorate less constancy, less earnestness, smaller claims upon \nthe world\'s attention, and much greater impostors.\n\n\nPART THE THIRD\n\n\nBAD deeds seldom prosper, happily for mankind; and the English \ncause gained no advantage from the cruel death of Joan of Arc.  For \na long time, the war went heavily on.  The Duke of Bedford died; \nthe alliance with the Duke of Burgundy was broken; and Lord Talbot \nbecame a great general on the English side in France.  But, two of \nthe consequences of wars are, Famine - because the people cannot \npeacefully cultivate the ground - and Pestilence, which comes of \nwant, misery, and suffering.  Both these horrors broke out in both \ncountries, and lasted for two wretched years.  Then, the war went \non again, and came by slow degrees to be so badly conducted by the \nEnglish government, that, within twenty years from the execution of \nthe Maid of Orleans, of all the great French conquests, the town of \nCalais alone remained in English hands.\n\nWhile these victories and defeats were taking place in the course \nof time, many strange things happened at home.  The young King, as \nhe grew up, proved to be very unlike his great father, and showed \nhimself a miserable puny creature.  There was no harm in him - he \nhad a great aversion to shedding blood:  which was something - but, \nhe was a weak, silly, helpless young man, and a mere shuttlecock to \nthe great lordly battledores about the Court.\n\nOf these battledores, Cardinal Beaufort, a relation of the King, \nand the Duke of Gloucester, were at first the most powerful.  The \nDuke of Gloucester had a wife, who was nonsensically accused of \npractising witchcraft to cause the King\'s death and lead to her \nhusband\'s coming to the throne, he being the next heir.  She was \ncharged with having, by the help of a ridiculous old woman named \nMargery (who was called a witch), made a little waxen doll in the \nKing\'s likeness, and put it before a slow fire that it might \ngradually melt away.  It was supposed, in such cases, that the \ndeath of the person whom the doll was made to represent, was sure \nto happen.  Whether the duchess was as ignorant as the rest of \nthem, and really did make such a doll with such an intention, I \ndon\'t know; but, you and I know very well that she might have made \na thousand dolls, if she had been stupid enough, and might have \nmelted them all, without hurting the King or anybody else.  \nHowever, she was tried for it, and so was old Margery, and so was \none of the duke\'s chaplains, who was charged with having assisted \nthem.  Both he and Margery were put to death, and the duchess, \nafter being taken on foot and bearing a lighted candle, three times \nround the City, as a penance, was imprisoned for life.  The duke, \nhimself, took all this pretty quietly, and made as little stir \nabout the matter as if he were rather glad to be rid of the \nduchess.\n\nBut, he was not destined to keep himself out of trouble long.  The \nroyal shuttlecock being three-and-twenty, the battledores were very \nanxious to get him married.  The Duke of Gloucester wanted him to \nmarry a daughter of the Count of Armagnac; but, the Cardinal and \nthe Earl of Suffolk were all for MARGARET, the daughter of the King \nof Sicily, who they knew was a resolute, ambitious woman and would \ngovern the King as she chose.  To make friends with this lady, the \nEarl of Suffolk, who went over to arrange the match, consented to \naccept her for the King\'s wife without any fortune, and even to \ngive up the two most valuable possessions England then had in \nFrance.  So, the marriage was arranged, on terms very advantageous \nto the lady; and Lord Suffolk brought her to England, and she was \nmarried at Westminster.  On what pretence this queen and her party \ncharged the Duke of Gloucester with high treason within a couple of \nyears, it is impossible to make out, the matter is so confused; \nbut, they pretended that the King\'s life was in danger, and they \ntook the duke prisoner.  A fortnight afterwards, he was found dead \nin bed (they said), and his body was shown to the people, and Lord \nSuffolk came in for the best part of his estates.  You know by this \ntime how strangely liable state prisoners were to sudden death.\n\nIf Cardinal Beaufort had any hand in this matter, it did him no \ngood, for he died within six weeks; thinking it very hard and \ncurious - at eighty years old! - that he could not live to be Pope.\n\nThis was the time when England had completed her loss of all her \ngreat French conquests.  The people charged the loss principally \nupon the Earl of Suffolk, now a duke, who had made those easy terms \nabout the Royal Marriage, and who, they believed, had even been \nbought by France.  So he was impeached as a traitor, on a great \nnumber of charges, but chiefly on accusations of having aided the \nFrench King, and of designing to make his own son King of England.  \nThe Commons and the people being violent against him, the King was \nmade (by his friends) to interpose to save him, by banishing him \nfor five years, and proroguing the Parliament.  The duke had much \nado to escape from a London mob, two thousand strong, who lay in \nwait for him in St. Giles\'s fields; but, he got down to his own \nestates in Suffolk, and sailed away from Ipswich.  Sailing across \nthe Channel, he sent into Calais to know if he might land there; \nbut, they kept his boat and men in the harbour, until an English \nship, carrying a hundred and fifty men and called the Nicholas of \nthe Tower, came alongside his little vessel, and ordered him on \nboard.  \'Welcome, traitor, as men say,\' was the captain\'s grim and \nnot very respectful salutation.  He was kept on board, a prisoner, \nfor eight-and-forty hours, and then a small boat appeared rowing \ntoward the ship.  As this boat came nearer, it was seen to have in \nit a block, a rusty sword, and an executioner in a black mask.  The \nduke was handed down into it, and there his head was cut off with \nsix strokes of the rusty sword.  Then, the little boat rowed away \nto Dover beach, where the body was cast out, and left until the \nduchess claimed it.  By whom, high in authority, this murder was \ncommitted, has never appeared.  No one was ever punished for it.\n\nThere now arose in Kent an Irishman, who gave himself the name of \nMortimer, but whose real name was JACK CADE.  Jack, in imitation of \nWat Tyler, though he was a very different and inferior sort of man, \naddressed the Kentish men upon their wrongs, occasioned by the bad \ngovernment of England, among so many battledores and such a poor \nshuttlecock; and the Kentish men rose up to the number of twenty \nthousand.  Their place of assembly was Blackheath, where, headed by \nJack, they put forth two papers, which they called \'The Complaint \nof the Commons of Kent,\' and \'The Requests of the Captain of the \nGreat Assembly in Kent.\'  They then retired to Sevenoaks.  The \nroyal army coming up with them here, they beat it and killed their \ngeneral.  Then, Jack dressed himself in the dead general\'s armour, \nand led his men to London.\n\nJack passed into the City from Southwark, over the bridge, and \nentered it in triumph, giving the strictest orders to his men not \nto plunder.  Having made a show of his forces there, while the \ncitizens looked on quietly, he went back into Southwark in good \norder, and passed the night.  Next day, he came back again, having \ngot hold in the meantime of Lord Say, an unpopular nobleman.  Says \nJack to the Lord Mayor and judges:  \'Will you be so good as to make \na tribunal in Guildhall, and try me this nobleman?\'  The court \nbeing hastily made, he was found guilty, and Jack and his men cut \nhis head off on Cornhill.  They also cut off the head of his son-\nin-law, and then went back in good order to Southwark again.\n\nBut, although the citizens could bear the beheading of an unpopular \nlord, they could not bear to have their houses pillaged.  And it \ndid so happen that Jack, after dinner - perhaps he had drunk a \nlittle too much - began to plunder the house where he lodged; upon \nwhich, of course, his men began to imitate him.  Wherefore, the \nLondoners took counsel with Lord Scales, who had a thousand \nsoldiers in the Tower; and defended London Bridge, and kept Jack \nand his people out.  This advantage gained, it was resolved by \ndivers great men to divide Jack\'s army in the old way, by making a \ngreat many promises on behalf of the state, that were never \nintended to be performed.  This DID divide them; some of Jack\'s men \nsaying that they ought to take the conditions which were offered, \nand others saying that they ought not, for they were only a snare; \nsome going home at once; others staying where they were; and all \ndoubting and quarrelling among themselves.\n\nJack, who was in two minds about fighting or accepting a pardon, \nand who indeed did both, saw at last that there was nothing to \nexpect from his men, and that it was very likely some of them would \ndeliver him up and get a reward of a thousand marks, which was \noffered for his apprehension.  So, after they had travelled and \nquarrelled all the way from Southwark to Blackheath, and from \nBlackheath to Rochester, he mounted a good horse and galloped away \ninto Sussex.  But, there galloped after him, on a better horse, one \nAlexander Iden, who came up with him, had a hard fight with him, \nand killed him.  Jack\'s head was set aloft on London Bridge, with \nthe face looking towards Blackheath, where he had raised his flag; \nand Alexander Iden got the thousand marks.\n\nIt is supposed by some, that the Duke of York, who had been removed \nfrom a high post abroad through the Queen\'s influence, and sent out \nof the way, to govern Ireland, was at the bottom of this rising of \nJack and his men, because he wanted to trouble the government.  He \nclaimed (though not yet publicly) to have a better right to the \nthrone than Henry of Lancaster, as one of the family of the Earl of \nMarch, whom Henry the Fourth had set aside.  Touching this claim, \nwhich, being through female relationship, was not according to the \nusual descent, it is enough to say that Henry the Fourth was the \nfree choice of the people and the Parliament, and that his family \nhad now reigned undisputed for sixty years.  The memory of Henry \nthe Fifth was so famous, and the English people loved it so much, \nthat the Duke of York\'s claim would, perhaps, never have been \nthought of (it would have been so hopeless) but for the unfortunate \ncircumstance of the present King\'s being by this time quite an \nidiot, and the country very ill governed.  These two circumstances \ngave the Duke of York a power he could not otherwise have had.\n\nWhether the Duke knew anything of Jack Cade, or not, he came over \nfrom Ireland while Jack\'s head was on London Bridge; being secretly \nadvised that the Queen was setting up his enemy, the Duke of \nSomerset, against him.  He went to Westminster, at the head of four \nthousand men, and on his knees before the King, represented to him \nthe bad state of the country, and petitioned him to summon a \nParliament to consider it.  This the King promised.  When the \nParliament was summoned, the Duke of York accused the Duke of \nSomerset, and the Duke of Somerset accused the Duke of York; and, \nboth in and out of Parliament, the followers of each party were \nfull of violence and hatred towards the other.  At length the Duke \nof York put himself at the head of a large force of his tenants, \nand, in arms, demanded the reformation of the Government.  Being \nshut out of London, he encamped at Dartford, and the royal army \nencamped at Blackheath.  According as either side triumphed, the \nDuke of York was arrested, or the Duke of Somerset was arrested.  \nThe trouble ended, for the moment, in the Duke of York renewing his \noath of allegiance, and going in peace to one of his own castles.\n\nHalf a year afterwards the Queen gave birth to a son, who was very \nill received by the people, and not believed to be the son of the \nKing.  It shows the Duke of York to have been a moderate man, \nunwilling to involve England in new troubles, that he did not take \nadvantage of the general discontent at this time, but really acted \nfor the public good.  He was made a member of the cabinet, and the \nKing being now so much worse that he could not be carried about and \nshown to the people with any decency, the duke was made Lord \nProtector of the kingdom, until the King should recover, or the \nPrince should come of age.  At the same time the Duke of Somerset \nwas committed to the Tower.  So, now the Duke of Somerset was down, \nand the Duke of York was up.  By the end of the year, however, the \nKing recovered his memory and some spark of sense; upon which the \nQueen used her power - which recovered with him - to get the \nProtector disgraced, and her favourite released.  So now the Duke \nof York was down, and the Duke of Somerset was up.\n\nThese ducal ups and downs gradually separated the whole nation into \nthe two parties of York and Lancaster, and led to those terrible \ncivil wars long known as the Wars of the Red and White Roses, \nbecause the red rose was the badge of the House of Lancaster, and \nthe white rose was the badge of the House of York.\n\nThe Duke of York, joined by some other powerful noblemen of the \nWhite Rose party, and leading a small army, met the King with \nanother small army at St. Alban\'s, and demanded that the Duke of \nSomerset should be given up.  The poor King, being made to say in \nanswer that he would sooner die, was instantly attacked.  The Duke \nof Somerset was killed, and the King himself was wounded in the \nneck, and took refuge in the house of a poor tanner.  Whereupon, \nthe Duke of York went to him, led him with great submission to the \nAbbey, and said he was very sorry for what had happened.  Having \nnow the King in his possession, he got a Parliament summoned and \nhimself once more made Protector, but, only for a few months; for, \non the King getting a little better again, the Queen and her party \ngot him into their possession, and disgraced the Duke once more.  \nSo, now the Duke of York was down again.\n\nSome of the best men in power, seeing the danger of these constant \nchanges, tried even then to prevent the Red and the White Rose \nWars.  They brought about a great council in London between the two \nparties.  The White Roses assembled in Blackfriars, the Red Roses \nin Whitefriars; and some good priests communicated between them, \nand made the proceedings known at evening to the King and the \njudges.  They ended in a peaceful agreement that there should be no \nmore quarrelling; and there was a great royal procession to St. \nPaul\'s, in which the Queen walked arm-in-arm with her old enemy, \nthe Duke of York, to show the people how comfortable they all were.  \nThis state of peace lasted half a year, when a dispute between the \nEarl of Warwick (one of the Duke\'s powerful friends) and some of \nthe King\'s servants at Court, led to an attack upon that Earl - who \nwas a White Rose - and to a sudden breaking out of all old \nanimosities.  So, here were greater ups and downs than ever.\n\nThere were even greater ups and downs than these, soon after.  \nAfter various battles, the Duke of York fled to Ireland, and his \nson the Earl of March to Calais, with their friends the Earls of \nSalisbury and Warwick; and a Parliament was held declaring them all \ntraitors.  Little the worse for this, the Earl of Warwick presently \ncame back, landed in Kent, was joined by the Archbishop of \nCanterbury and other powerful noblemen and gentlemen, engaged the \nKing\'s forces at Northampton, signally defeated them, and took the \nKing himself prisoner, who was found in his tent.  Warwick would \nhave been glad, I dare say, to have taken the Queen and Prince too, \nbut they escaped into Wales and thence into Scotland.\n\nThe King was carried by the victorious force straight to London, \nand made to call a new Parliament, which immediately declared that \nthe Duke of York and those other noblemen were not traitors, but \nexcellent subjects.  Then, back comes the Duke from Ireland at the \nhead of five hundred horsemen, rides from London to Westminster, \nand enters the House of Lords.  There, he laid his hand upon the \ncloth of gold which covered the empty throne, as if he had half a \nmind to sit down in it - but he did not.  On the Archbishop of \nCanterbury, asking him if he would visit the King, who was in his \npalace close by, he replied, \'I know no one in this country, my \nlord, who ought not to visit ME.\'  None of the lords present spoke \na single word; so, the duke went out as he had come in, established \nhimself royally in the King\'s palace, and, six days afterwards, \nsent in to the Lords a formal statement of his claim to the throne.  \nThe lords went to the King on this momentous subject, and after a \ngreat deal of discussion, in which the judges and the other law \nofficers were afraid to give an opinion on either side, the \nquestion was compromised.  It was agreed that the present King \nshould retain the crown for his life, and that it should then pass \nto the Duke of York and his heirs.\n\nBut, the resolute Queen, determined on asserting her son\'s right, \nwould hear of no such thing.  She came from Scotland to the north \nof England, where several powerful lords armed in her cause.  The \nDuke of York, for his part, set off with some five thousand men, a \nlittle time before Christmas Day, one thousand four hundred and \nsixty, to give her battle.  He lodged at Sandal Castle, near \nWakefield, and the Red Roses defied him to come out on Wakefield \nGreen, and fight them then and there.  His generals said, he had \nbest wait until his gallant son, the Earl of March, came up with \nhis power; but, he was determined to accept the challenge.  He did \nso, in an evil hour.  He was hotly pressed on all sides, two \nthousand of his men lay dead on Wakefield Green, and he himself was \ntaken prisoner.  They set him down in mock state on an ant-hill, \nand twisted grass about his head, and pretended to pay court to him \non their knees, saying, \'O King, without a kingdom, and Prince \nwithout a people, we hope your gracious Majesty is very well and \nhappy!\'  They did worse than this; they cut his head off, and \nhanded it on a pole to the Queen, who laughed with delight when she \nsaw it (you recollect their walking so religiously and comfortably \nto St. Paul\'s!), and had it fixed, with a paper crown upon its \nhead, on the walls of York.  The Earl of Salisbury lost his head, \ntoo; and the Duke of York\'s second son, a handsome boy who was \nflying with his tutor over Wakefield Bridge, was stabbed in the \nheart by a murderous, lord - Lord Clifford by name - whose father \nhad been killed by the White Roses in the fight at St. Alban\'s.  \nThere was awful sacrifice of life in this battle, for no quarter \nwas given, and the Queen was wild for revenge.  When men \nunnaturally fight against their own countrymen, they are always \nobserved to be more unnaturally cruel and filled with rage than \nthey are against any other enemy.\n\nBut, Lord Clifford had stabbed the second son of the Duke of York - \nnot the first.  The eldest son, Edward Earl of March, was at \nGloucester; and, vowing vengeance for the death of his father, his \nbrother, and their faithful friends, he began to march against the \nQueen.  He had to turn and fight a great body of Welsh and Irish \nfirst, who worried his advance.  These he defeated in a great fight \nat Mortimer\'s Cross, near Hereford, where he beheaded a number of \nthe Red Roses taken in battle, in retaliation for the beheading of \nthe White Roses at Wakefield.  The Queen had the next turn of \nbeheading.  Having moved towards London, and falling in, between \nSt. Alban\'s and Barnet, with the Earl of Warwick and the Duke of \nNorfolk, White Roses both, who were there with an army to oppose \nher, and had got the King with them; she defeated them with great \nloss, and struck off the heads of two prisoners of note, who were \nin the King\'s tent with him, and to whom the King had promised his \nprotection.  Her triumph, however, was very short.  She had no \ntreasure, and her army subsisted by plunder.  This caused them to \nbe hated and dreaded by the people, and particularly by the London \npeople, who were wealthy.  As soon as the Londoners heard that \nEdward, Earl of March, united with the Earl of Warwick, was \nadvancing towards the city, they refused to send the Queen \nsupplies, and made a great rejoicing.\n\nThe Queen and her men retreated with all speed, and Edward and \nWarwick came on, greeted with loud acclamations on every side.  The \ncourage, beauty, and virtues of young Edward could not be \nsufficiently praised by the whole people.  He rode into London like \na conqueror, and met with an enthusiastic welcome.  A few days \nafterwards, Lord Falconbridge and the Bishop of Exeter assembled \nthe citizens in St. John\'s Field, Clerkenwell, and asked them if \nthey would have Henry of Lancaster for their King?  To this they \nall roared, \'No, no, no!\' and \'King Edward!  King Edward!\'  Then, \nsaid those noblemen, would they love and serve young Edward?  To \nthis they all cried, \'Yes, yes!\' and threw up their caps and \nclapped their hands, and cheered tremendously.\n\nTherefore, it was declared that by joining the Queen and not \nprotecting those two prisoners of note, Henry of Lancaster had \nforfeited the crown; and Edward of York was proclaimed King.  He \nmade a great speech to the applauding people at Westminster, and \nsat down as sovereign of England on that throne, on the golden \ncovering of which his father - worthy of a better fate than the \nbloody axe which cut the thread of so many lives in England, \nthrough so many years - had laid his hand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FOURTH\n\n\n\nKING EDWARD THE FOURTH was not quite twenty-one years of age when \nhe took that unquiet seat upon the throne of England.  The \nLancaster party, the Red Roses, were then assembling in great \nnumbers near York, and it was necessary to give them battle \ninstantly.  But, the stout Earl of Warwick leading for the young \nKing, and the young King himself closely following him, and the \nEnglish people crowding round the Royal standard, the White and the \nRed Roses met, on a wild March day when the snow was falling \nheavily, at Towton; and there such a furious battle raged between \nthem, that the total loss amounted to forty thousand men - all \nEnglishmen, fighting, upon English ground, against one another.  \nThe young King gained the day, took down the heads of his father \nand brother from the walls of York, and put up the heads of some of \nthe most famous noblemen engaged in the battle on the other side.  \nThen, he went to London and was crowned with great splendour.\n\nA new Parliament met.  No fewer than one hundred and fifty of the \nprincipal noblemen and gentlemen on the Lancaster side were \ndeclared traitors, and the King - who had very little humanity, \nthough he was handsome in person and agreeable in manners - \nresolved to do all he could, to pluck up the Red Rose root and \nbranch.\n\nQueen Margaret, however, was still active for her young son.  She \nobtained help from Scotland and from Normandy, and took several \nimportant English castles.  But, Warwick soon retook them; the \nQueen lost all her treasure on board ship in a great storm; and \nboth she and her son suffered great misfortunes.  Once, in the \nwinter weather, as they were riding through a forest, they were \nattacked and plundered by a party of robbers; and, when they had \nescaped from these men and were passing alone and on foot through a \nthick dark part of the wood, they came, all at once, upon another \nrobber.  So the Queen, with a stout heart, took the little Prince \nby the hand, and going straight up to that robber, said to him, \'My \nfriend, this is the young son of your lawful King!  I confide him \nto your care.\'  The robber was surprised, but took the boy in his \narms, and faithfully restored him and his mother to their friends.  \nIn the end, the Queen\'s soldiers being beaten and dispersed, she \nwent abroad again, and kept quiet for the present.\n\nNow, all this time, the deposed King Henry was concealed by a Welsh \nknight, who kept him close in his castle.  But, next year, the \nLancaster party recovering their spirits, raised a large body of \nmen, and called him out of his retirement, to put him at their \nhead.  They were joined by some powerful noblemen who had sworn \nfidelity to the new King, but who were ready, as usual, to break \ntheir oaths, whenever they thought there was anything to be got by \nit.  One of the worst things in the history of the war of the Red \nand White Roses, is the ease with which these noblemen, who should \nhave set an example of honour to the people, left either side as \nthey took slight offence, or were disappointed in their greedy \nexpectations, and joined the other.  Well! Warwick\'s brother soon \nbeat the Lancastrians, and the false noblemen, being taken, were \nbeheaded without a moment\'s loss of time.  The deposed King had a \nnarrow escape; three of his servants were taken, and one of them \nbore his cap of estate, which was set with pearls and embroidered \nwith two golden crowns.  However, the head to which the cap \nbelonged, got safely into Lancashire, and lay pretty quietly there \n(the people in the secret being very true) for more than a year.  \nAt length, an old monk gave such intelligence as led to Henry\'s \nbeing taken while he was sitting at dinner in a place called \nWaddington Hall.  He was immediately sent to London, and met at \nIslington by the Earl of Warwick, by whose directions he was put \nupon a horse, with his legs tied under it, and paraded three times \nround the pillory.  Then, he was carried off to the Tower, where \nthey treated him well enough.\n\nThe White Rose being so triumphant, the young King abandoned \nhimself entirely to pleasure, and led a jovial life.  But, thorns \nwere springing up under his bed of roses, as he soon found out.  \nFor, having been privately married to ELIZABETH WOODVILLE, a young \nwidow lady, very beautiful and very captivating; and at last \nresolving to make his secret known, and to declare her his Queen; \nhe gave some offence to the Earl of Warwick, who was usually called \nthe King-Maker, because of his power and influence, and because of \nhis having lent such great help to placing Edward on the throne.  \nThis offence was not lessened by the jealousy with which the Nevil \nfamily (the Earl of Warwick\'s) regarded the promotion of the \nWoodville family.  For, the young Queen was so bent on providing \nfor her relations, that she made her father an earl and a great \nofficer of state; married her five sisters to young noblemen of the \nhighest rank; and provided for her younger brother, a young man of \ntwenty, by marrying him to an immensely rich old duchess of eighty.  \nThe Earl of Warwick took all this pretty graciously for a man of \nhis proud temper, until the question arose to whom the King\'s \nsister, MARGARET, should be married.  The Earl of Warwick said, \'To \none of the French King\'s sons,\' and was allowed to go over to the \nFrench King to make friendly proposals for that purpose, and to \nhold all manner of friendly interviews with him.  But, while he was \nso engaged, the Woodville party married the young lady to the Duke \nof Burgundy!  Upon this he came back in great rage and scorn, and \nshut himself up discontented, in his Castle of Middleham.\n\nA reconciliation, though not a very sincere one, was patched up \nbetween the Earl of Warwick and the King, and lasted until the Earl \nmarried his daughter, against the King\'s wishes, to the Duke of \nClarence.  While the marriage was being celebrated at Calais, the \npeople in the north of England, where the influence of the Nevil \nfamily was strongest, broke out into rebellion; their complaint \nwas, that England was oppressed and plundered by the Woodville \nfamily, whom they demanded to have removed from power.  As they \nwere joined by great numbers of people, and as they openly declared \nthat they were supported by the Earl of Warwick, the King did not \nknow what to do.  At last, as he wrote to the earl beseeching his \naid, he and his new son-in-law came over to England, and began to \narrange the business by shutting the King up in Middleham Castle in \nthe safe keeping of the Archbishop of York; so England was not only \nin the strange position of having two kings at once, but they were \nboth prisoners at the same time.\n\nEven as yet, however, the King-Maker was so far true to the King, \nthat he dispersed a new rising of the Lancastrians, took their \nleader prisoner, and brought him to the King, who ordered him to be \nimmediately executed.  He presently allowed the King to return to \nLondon, and there innumerable pledges of forgiveness and friendship \nwere exchanged between them, and between the Nevils and the \nWoodvilles; the King\'s eldest daughter was promised in marriage to \nthe heir of the Nevil family; and more friendly oaths were sworn, \nand more friendly promises made, than this book would hold.\n\nThey lasted about three months.  At the end of that time, the \nArchbishop of York made a feast for the King, the Earl of Warwick, \nand the Duke of Clarence, at his house, the Moor, in Hertfordshire.  \nThe King was washing his hands before supper, when some one \nwhispered him that a body of a hundred men were lying in ambush \noutside the house.  Whether this were true or untrue, the King took \nfright, mounted his horse, and rode through the dark night to \nWindsor Castle.  Another reconciliation was patched up between him \nand the King-Maker, but it was a short one, and it was the last.  A \nnew rising took place in Lincolnshire, and the King marched to \nrepress it.  Having done so, he proclaimed that both the Earl of \nWarwick and the Duke of Clarence were traitors, who had secretly \nassisted it, and who had been prepared publicly to join it on the \nfollowing day.  In these dangerous circumstances they both took \nship and sailed away to the French court.\n\nAnd here a meeting took place between the Earl of Warwick and his \nold enemy, the Dowager Queen Margaret, through whom his father had \nhad his head struck off, and to whom he had been a bitter foe.  \nBut, now, when he said that he had done with the ungrateful and \nperfidious Edward of York, and that henceforth he devoted himself \nto the restoration of the House of Lancaster, either in the person \nof her husband or of her little son, she embraced him as if he had \never been her dearest friend.  She did more than that; she married \nher son to his second daughter, the Lady Anne.  However agreeable \nthis marriage was to the new friends, it was very disagreeable to \nthe Duke of Clarence, who perceived that his father-in-law, the \nKing-Maker, would never make HIM King, now.  So, being but a weak-\nminded young traitor, possessed of very little worth or sense, he \nreadily listened to an artful court lady sent over for the purpose, \nand promised to turn traitor once more, and go over to his brother, \nKing Edward, when a fitting opportunity should come.\n\nThe Earl of Warwick, knowing nothing of this, soon redeemed his \npromise to the Dowager Queen Margaret, by invading England and \nlanding at Plymouth, where he instantly proclaimed King Henry, and \nsummoned all Englishmen between the ages of sixteen and sixty, to \njoin his banner.  Then, with his army increasing as he marched \nalong, he went northward, and came so near King Edward, who was in \nthat part of the country, that Edward had to ride hard for it to \nthe coast of Norfolk, and thence to get away in such ships as he \ncould find, to Holland.  Thereupon, the triumphant King-Maker and \nhis false son-in-law, the Duke of Clarence, went to London, took \nthe old King out of the Tower, and walked him in a great procession \nto Saint Paul\'s Cathedral with the crown upon his head.  This did \nnot improve the temper of the Duke of Clarence, who saw himself \nfarther off from being King than ever; but he kept his secret, and \nsaid nothing.  The Nevil family were restored to all their honours \nand glories, and the Woodvilles and the rest were disgraced.  The \nKing-Maker, less sanguinary than the King, shed no blood except \nthat of the Earl of Worcester, who had been so cruel to the people \nas to have gained the title of the Butcher.  Him they caught hidden \nin a tree, and him they tried and executed.  No other death stained \nthe King-Maker\'s triumph.\n\nTo dispute this triumph, back came King Edward again, next year, \nlanding at Ravenspur, coming on to York, causing all his men to cry \n\'Long live King Henry!\' and swearing on the altar, without a blush, \nthat he came to lay no claim to the crown.  Now was the time for \nthe Duke of Clarence, who ordered his men to assume the White Rose, \nand declare for his brother.  The Marquis of Montague, though the \nEarl of Warwick\'s brother, also declining to fight against King \nEdward, he went on successfully to London, where the Archbishop of \nYork let him into the City, and where the people made great \ndemonstrations in his favour.  For this they had four reasons.  \nFirstly, there were great numbers of the King\'s adherents hiding in \nthe City and ready to break out; secondly, the King owed them a \ngreat deal of money, which they could never hope to get if he were \nunsuccessful; thirdly, there was a young prince to inherit the \ncrown; and fourthly, the King was gay and handsome, and more \npopular than a better man might have been with the City ladies.  \nAfter a stay of only two days with these worthy supporters, the \nKing marched out to Barnet Common, to give the Earl of Warwick \nbattle.  And now it was to be seen, for the last time, whether the \nKing or the King-Maker was to carry the day.\n\nWhile the battle was yet pending, the fainthearted Duke of Clarence \nbegan to repent, and sent over secret messages to his father-in-\nlaw, offering his services in mediation with the King.  But, the \nEarl of Warwick disdainfully rejected them, and replied that \nClarence was false and perjured, and that he would settle the \nquarrel by the sword.  The battle began at four o\'clock in the \nmorning and lasted until ten, and during the greater part of the \ntime it was fought in a thick mist - absurdly supposed to be raised \nby a magician.  The loss of life was very great, for the hatred was \nstrong on both sides.  The King-Maker was defeated, and the King \ntriumphed.  Both the Earl of Warwick and his brother were slain, \nand their bodies lay in St. Paul\'s, for some days, as a spectacle \nto the people.\n\nMargaret\'s spirit was not broken even by this great blow.  Within \nfive days she was in arms again, and raised her standard in Bath, \nwhence she set off with her army, to try and join Lord Pembroke, \nwho had a force in Wales.  But, the King, coming up with her \noutside the town of Tewkesbury, and ordering his brother, the DUKE \nOF GLOUCESTER, who was a brave soldier, to attack her men, she \nsustained an entire defeat, and was taken prisoner, together with \nher son, now only eighteen years of age.  The conduct of the King \nto this poor youth was worthy of his cruel character.  He ordered \nhim to be led into his tent.  \'And what,\' said he, \'brought YOU to \nEngland?\'  \'I came to England,\' replied the prisoner, with a spirit \nwhich a man of spirit might have admired in a captive, \'to recover \nmy father\'s kingdom, which descended to him as his right, and from \nhim descends to me, as mine.\'  The King, drawing off his iron \ngauntlet, struck him with it in the face; and the Duke of Clarence \nand some other lords, who were there, drew their noble swords, and \nkilled him.\n\nHis mother survived him, a prisoner, for five years; after her \nransom by the King of France, she survived for six years more.  \nWithin three weeks of this murder, Henry died one of those \nconvenient sudden deaths which were so common in the Tower; in \nplainer words, he was murdered by the King\'s order.\n\nHaving no particular excitement on his hands after this great \ndefeat of the Lancaster party, and being perhaps desirous to get \nrid of some of his fat (for he was now getting too corpulent to be \nhandsome), the King thought of making war on France.  As he wanted \nmore money for this purpose than the Parliament could give him, \nthough they were usually ready enough for war, he invented a new \nway of raising it, by sending for the principal citizens of London, \nand telling them, with a grave face, that he was very much in want \nof cash, and would take it very kind in them if they would lend him \nsome.  It being impossible for them safely to refuse, they \ncomplied, and the moneys thus forced from them were called - no \ndoubt to the great amusement of the King and the Court - as if they \nwere free gifts, \'Benevolences.\'  What with grants from Parliament, \nand what with Benevolences, the King raised an army and passed over \nto Calais.  As nobody wanted war, however, the French King made \nproposals of peace, which were accepted, and a truce was concluded \nfor seven long years.  The proceedings between the Kings of France \nand England on this occasion, were very friendly, very splendid, \nand very distrustful.  They finished with a meeting between the two \nKings, on a temporary bridge over the river Somme, where they \nembraced through two holes in a strong wooden grating like a lion\'s \ncage, and made several bows and fine speeches to one another.\n\nIt was time, now, that the Duke of Clarence should be punished for \nhis treacheries; and Fate had his punishment in store.  He was, \nprobably, not trusted by the King - for who could trust him who \nknew him! - and he had certainly a powerful opponent in his brother \nRichard, Duke of Gloucester, who, being avaricious and ambitious, \nwanted to marry that widowed daughter of the Earl of Warwick\'s who \nhad been espoused to the deceased young Prince, at Calais.  \nClarence, who wanted all the family wealth for himself, secreted \nthis lady, whom Richard found disguised as a servant in the City of \nLondon, and whom he married; arbitrators appointed by the King, \nthen divided the property between the brothers.  This led to ill-\nwill and mistrust between them.  Clarence\'s wife dying, and he \nwishing to make another marriage, which was obnoxious to the King, \nhis ruin was hurried by that means, too.  At first, the Court \nstruck at his retainers and dependents, and accused some of them of \nmagic and witchcraft, and similar nonsense.  Successful against \nthis small game, it then mounted to the Duke himself, who was \nimpeached by his brother the King, in person, on a variety of such \ncharges.  He was found guilty, and sentenced to be publicly \nexecuted.  He never was publicly executed, but he met his death \nsomehow, in the Tower, and, no doubt, through some agency of the \nKing or his brother Gloucester, or both.  It was supposed at the \ntime that he was told to choose the manner of his death, and that \nhe chose to be drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine.  I hope the story \nmay be true, for it would have been a becoming death for such a \nmiserable creature.\n\nThe King survived him some five years.  He died in the forty-second \nyear of his life, and the twenty-third of his reign.  He had a very \ngood capacity and some good points, but he was selfish, careless, \nsensual, and cruel.  He was a favourite with the people for his \nshowy manners; and the people were a good example to him in the \nconstancy of their attachment.  He was penitent on his death-bed \nfor his \'benevolences,\' and other extortions, and ordered \nrestitution to be made to the people who had suffered from them.  \nHe also called about his bed the enriched members of the Woodville \nfamily, and the proud lords whose honours were of older date, and \nendeavoured to reconcile them, for the sake of the peaceful \nsuccession of his son and the tranquillity of England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIFTH\n\n\n\nTHE late King\'s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, called EDWARD \nafter him, was only thirteen years of age at his father\'s death.  \nHe was at Ludlow Castle with his uncle, the Earl of Rivers.  The \nprince\'s brother, the Duke of York, only eleven years of age, was \nin London with his mother.  The boldest, most crafty, and most \ndreaded nobleman in England at that time was their uncle RICHARD, \nDuke of Gloucester, and everybody wondered how the two poor boys \nwould fare with such an uncle for a friend or a foe.\n\nThe Queen, their mother, being exceedingly uneasy about this, was \nanxious that instructions should be sent to Lord Rivers to raise an \narmy to escort the young King safely to London.  But, Lord \nHastings, who was of the Court party opposed to the Woodvilles, and \nwho disliked the thought of giving them that power, argued against \nthe proposal, and obliged the Queen to be satisfied with an escort \nof two thousand horse.  The Duke of Gloucester did nothing, at \nfirst, to justify suspicion.  He came from Scotland (where he was \ncommanding an army) to York, and was there the first to swear \nallegiance to his nephew.  He then wrote a condoling letter to the \nQueen-Mother, and set off to be present at the coronation in \nLondon.\n\nNow, the young King, journeying towards London too, with Lord \nRivers and Lord Gray, came to Stony Stratford, as his uncle came to \nNorthampton, about ten miles distant; and when those two lords \nheard that the Duke of Gloucester was so near, they proposed to the \nyoung King that they should go back and greet him in his name.  The \nboy being very willing that they should do so, they rode off and \nwere received with great friendliness, and asked by the Duke of \nGloucester to stay and dine with him.  In the evening, while they \nwere merry together, up came the Duke of Buckingham with three \nhundred horsemen; and next morning the two lords and the two dukes, \nand the three hundred horsemen, rode away together to rejoin the \nKing.  Just as they were entering Stony Stratford, the Duke of \nGloucester, checking his horse, turned suddenly on the two lords, \ncharged them with alienating from him the affections of his sweet \nnephew, and caused them to be arrested by the three hundred \nhorsemen and taken back.  Then, he and the Duke of Buckingham went \nstraight to the King (whom they had now in their power), to whom \nthey made a show of kneeling down, and offering great love and \nsubmission; and then they ordered his attendants to disperse, and \ntook him, alone with them, to Northampton.\n\nA few days afterwards they conducted him to London, and lodged him \nin the Bishop\'s Palace.  But, he did not remain there long; for, \nthe Duke of Buckingham with a tender face made a speech expressing \nhow anxious he was for the Royal boy\'s safety, and how much safer \nhe would be in the Tower until his coronation, than he could be \nanywhere else.  So, to the Tower he was taken, very carefully, and \nthe Duke of Gloucester was named Protector of the State.\n\nAlthough Gloucester had proceeded thus far with a very smooth \ncountenance - and although he was a clever man, fair of speech, and \nnot ill-looking, in spite of one of his shoulders being something \nhigher than the other - and although he had come into the City \nriding bare-headed at the King\'s side, and looking very fond of him \n- he had made the King\'s mother more uneasy yet; and when the Royal \nboy was taken to the Tower, she became so alarmed that she took \nsanctuary in Westminster with her five daughters.\n\nNor did she do this without reason, for, the Duke of Gloucester, \nfinding that the lords who were opposed to the Woodville family \nwere faithful to the young King nevertheless, quickly resolved to \nstrike a blow for himself.  Accordingly, while those lords met in \ncouncil at the Tower, he and those who were in his interest met in \nseparate council at his own residence, Crosby Palace, in \nBishopsgate Street.  Being at last quite prepared, he one day \nappeared unexpectedly at the council in the Tower, and appeared to \nbe very jocular and merry.  He was particularly gay with the Bishop \nof Ely:  praising the strawberries that grew in his garden on \nHolborn Hill, and asking him to have some gathered that he might \neat them at dinner.  The Bishop, quite proud of the honour, sent \none of his men to fetch some; and the Duke, still very jocular and \ngay, went out; and the council all said what a very agreeable duke \nhe was!  In a little time, however, he came back quite altered - \nnot at all jocular - frowning and fierce - and suddenly said, -\n\n\'What do those persons deserve who have compassed my destruction; I \nbeing the King\'s lawful, as well as natural, protector?\'\n\nTo this strange question, Lord Hastings replied, that they deserved \ndeath, whosoever they were.\n\n\'Then,\' said the Duke, \'I tell you that they are that sorceress my \nbrother\'s wife;\' meaning the Queen:  \'and that other sorceress, \nJane Shore.  Who, by witchcraft, have withered my body, and caused \nmy arm to shrink as I now show you.\'\n\nHe then pulled up his sleeve and showed them his arm, which was \nshrunken, it is true, but which had been so, as they all very well \nknew, from the hour of his birth.\n\nJane Shore, being then the lover of Lord Hastings, as she had \nformerly been of the late King, that lord knew that he himself was \nattacked.  So, he said, in some confusion, \'Certainly, my Lord, if \nthey have done this, they be worthy of punishment.\'\n\n\'If?\' said the Duke of Gloucester; \'do you talk to me of ifs?  I \ntell you that they HAVE so done, and I will make it good upon thy \nbody, thou traitor!\'\n\nWith that, he struck the table a great blow with his fist.  This \nwas a signal to some of his people outside to cry \'Treason!\'  They \nimmediately did so, and there was a rush into the chamber of so \nmany armed men that it was filled in a moment.\n\n\'First,\' said the Duke of Gloucester to Lord Hastings, \'I arrest \nthee, traitor!  And let him,\' he added to the armed men who took \nhim, \'have a priest at once, for by St. Paul I will not dine until \nI have seen his head of!\'\n\nLord Hastings was hurried to the green by the Tower chapel, and \nthere beheaded on a log of wood that happened to be lying on the \nground.  Then, the Duke dined with a good appetite, and after \ndinner summoning the principal citizens to attend him, told them \nthat Lord Hastings and the rest had designed to murder both himself \nand the Duke if Buckingham, who stood by his side, if he had not \nprovidentially discovered their design.  He requested them to be so \nobliging as to inform their fellow-citizens of the truth of what he \nsaid, and issued a proclamation (prepared and neatly copied out \nbeforehand) to the same effect.\n\nOn the same day that the Duke did these things in the Tower, Sir \nRichard Ratcliffe, the boldest and most undaunted of his men, went \ndown to Pontefract; arrested Lord Rivers, Lord Gray, and two other \ngentlemen; and publicly executed them on the scaffold, without any \ntrial, for having intended the Duke\'s death.  Three days afterwards \nthe Duke, not to lose time, went down the river to Westminster in \nhis barge, attended by divers bishops, lords, and soldiers, and \ndemanded that the Queen should deliver her second son, the Duke of \nYork, into his safe keeping.  The Queen, being obliged to comply, \nresigned the child after she had wept over him; and Richard of \nGloucester placed him with his brother in the Tower.  Then, he \nseized Jane Shore, and, because she had been the lover of the late \nKing, confiscated her property, and got her sentenced to do public \npenance in the streets by walking in a scanty dress, with bare \nfeet, and carrying a lighted candle, to St. Paul\'s Cathedral, \nthrough the most crowded part of the City.\n\nHaving now all things ready for his own advancement, he caused a \nfriar to preach a sermon at the cross which stood in front of St. \nPaul\'s Cathedral, in which he dwelt upon the profligate manners of \nthe late King, and upon the late shame of Jane Shore, and hinted \nthat the princes were not his children.  \'Whereas, good people,\' \nsaid the friar, whose name was SHAW, \'my Lord the Protector, the \nnoble Duke of Gloucester, that sweet prince, the pattern of all the \nnoblest virtues, is the perfect image and express likeness of his \nfather.\'  There had been a little plot between the Duke and the \nfriar, that the Duke should appear in the crowd at this moment, \nwhen it was expected that the people would cry \'Long live King \nRichard!\'  But, either through the friar saying the words too soon, \nor through the Duke\'s coming too late, the Duke and the words did \nnot come together, and the people only laughed, and the friar \nsneaked off ashamed.\n\nThe Duke of Buckingham was a better hand at such business than the \nfriar, so he went to the Guildhall the next day, and addressed the \ncitizens in the Lord Protector\'s behalf.  A few dirty men, who had \nbeen hired and stationed there for the purpose, crying when he had \ndone, \'God save King Richard!\' he made them a great bow, and \nthanked them with all his heart.  Next day, to make an end of it, \nhe went with the mayor and some lords and citizens to Bayard \nCastle, by the river, where Richard then was, and read an address, \nhumbly entreating him to accept the Crown of England.  Richard, who \nlooked down upon them out of a window and pretended to be in great \nuneasiness and alarm, assured them there was nothing he desired \nless, and that his deep affection for his nephews forbade him to \nthink of it.  To this the Duke of Buckingham replied, with \npretended warmth, that the free people of England would never \nsubmit to his nephew\'s rule, and that if Richard, who was the \nlawful heir, refused the Crown, why then they must find some one \nelse to wear it.  The Duke of Gloucester returned, that since he \nused that strong language, it became his painful duty to think no \nmore of himself, and to accept the Crown.\n\nUpon that, the people cheered and dispersed; and the Duke of \nGloucester and the Duke of Buckingham passed a pleasant evening, \ntalking over the play they had just acted with so much success, and \nevery word of which they had prepared together.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV - ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE THIRD\n\n\n\nKING RICHARD THE THIRD was up betimes in the morning, and went to \nWestminster Hall.  In the Hall was a marble seat, upon which he sat \nhimself down between two great noblemen, and told the people that \nhe began the new reign in that place, because the first duty of a \nsovereign was to administer the laws equally to all, and to \nmaintain justice.  He then mounted his horse and rode back to the \nCity, where he was received by the clergy and the crowd as if he \nreally had a right to the throne, and really were a just man.  The \nclergy and the crowd must have been rather ashamed of themselves in \nsecret, I think, for being such poor-spirited knaves.\n\nThe new King and his Queen were soon crowned with a great deal of \nshow and noise, which the people liked very much; and then the King \nset forth on a royal progress through his dominions.  He was \ncrowned a second time at York, in order that the people might have \nshow and noise enough; and wherever he went was received with \nshouts of rejoicing - from a good many people of strong lungs, who \nwere paid to strain their throats in crying, \'God save King \nRichard!\'  The plan was so successful that I am told it has been \nimitated since, by other usurpers, in other progresses through \nother dominions.\n\nWhile he was on this journey, King Richard stayed a week at \nWarwick.  And from Warwick he sent instructions home for one of the \nwickedest murders that ever was done - the murder of the two young \nprinces, his nephews, who were shut up in the Tower of London.\n\nSir Robert Brackenbury was at that time Governor of the Tower.  To \nhim, by the hands of a messenger named JOHN GREEN, did King Richard \nsend a letter, ordering him by some means to put the two young \nprinces to death.  But Sir Robert - I hope because he had children \nof his own, and loved them - sent John Green back again, riding and \nspurring along the dusty roads, with the answer that he could not \ndo so horrible a piece of work.  The King, having frowningly \nconsidered a little, called to him SIR JAMES TYRREL, his master of \nthe horse, and to him gave authority to take command of the Tower, \nwhenever he would, for twenty-four hours, and to keep all the keys \nof the Tower during that space of time.  Tyrrel, well knowing what \nwas wanted, looked about him for two hardened ruffians, and chose \nJOHN DIGHTON, one of his own grooms, and MILES FOREST, who was a \nmurderer by trade.  Having secured these two assistants, he went, \nupon a day in August, to the Tower, showed his authority from the \nKing, took the command for four-and-twenty hours, and obtained \npossession of the keys.  And when the black night came he went \ncreeping, creeping, like a guilty villain as he was, up the dark, \nstone winding stairs, and along the dark stone passages, until he \ncame to the door of the room where the two young princes, having \nsaid their prayers, lay fast asleep, clasped in each other\'s arms.  \nAnd while he watched and listened at the door, he sent in those \nevil demons, John Dighton and Miles Forest, who smothered the two \nprinces with the bed and pillows, and carried their bodies down the \nstairs, and buried them under a great heap of stones at the \nstaircase foot.  And when the day came, he gave up the command of \nthe Tower, and restored the keys, and hurried away without once \nlooking behind him; and Sir Robert Brackenbury went with fear and \nsadness to the princes\' room, and found the princes gone for ever.\n\nYou know, through all this history, how true it is that traitors \nare never true, and you will not be surprised to learn that the \nDuke of Buckingham soon turned against King Richard, and joined a \ngreat conspiracy that was formed to dethrone him, and to place the \ncrown upon its rightful owner\'s head.  Richard had meant to keep \nthe murder secret; but when he heard through his spies that this \nconspiracy existed, and that many lords and gentlemen drank in \nsecret to the healths of the two young princes in the Tower, he \nmade it known that they were dead.  The conspirators, though \nthwarted for a moment, soon resolved to set up for the crown \nagainst the murderous Richard, HENRY Earl of Richmond, grandson of \nCatherine:  that widow of Henry the Fifth who married Owen Tudor.  \nAnd as Henry was of the house of Lancaster, they proposed that he \nshould marry the Princess Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of the \nlate King, now the heiress of the house of York, and thus by \nuniting the rival families put an end to the fatal wars of the Red \nand White Roses.  All being settled, a time was appointed for Henry \nto come over from Brittany, and for a great rising against Richard \nto take place in several parts of England at the same hour.  On a \ncertain day, therefore, in October, the revolt took place; but \nunsuccessfully.  Richard was prepared, Henry was driven back at sea \nby a storm, his followers in England were dispersed, and the Duke \nof Buckingham was taken, and at once beheaded in the market-place \nat Salisbury.\n\nThe time of his success was a good time, Richard thought, for \nsummoning a Parliament and getting some money.  So, a Parliament \nwas called, and it flattered and fawned upon him as much as he \ncould possibly desire, and declared him to be the rightful King of \nEngland, and his only son Edward, then eleven years of age, the \nnext heir to the throne.\n\nRichard knew full well that, let the Parliament say what it would, \nthe Princess Elizabeth was remembered by people as the heiress of \nthe house of York; and having accurate information besides, of its \nbeing designed by the conspirators to marry her to Henry of \nRichmond, he felt that it would much strengthen him and weaken \nthem, to be beforehand with them, and marry her to his son.  With \nthis view he went to the Sanctuary at Westminster, where the late \nKing\'s widow and her daughter still were, and besought them to come \nto Court:  where (he swore by anything and everything) they should \nbe safely and honourably entertained.  They came, accordingly, but \nhad scarcely been at Court a month when his son died suddenly - or \nwas poisoned - and his plan was crushed to pieces.\n\nIn this extremity, King Richard, always active, thought, \'I must \nmake another plan.\'  And he made the plan of marrying the Princess \nElizabeth himself, although she was his niece.  There was one \ndifficulty in the way:  his wife, the Queen Anne, was alive.  But, \nhe knew (remembering his nephews) how to remove that obstacle, and \nhe made love to the Princess Elizabeth, telling her he felt \nperfectly confident that the Queen would die in February.  The \nPrincess was not a very scrupulous young lady, for, instead of \nrejecting the murderer of her brothers with scorn and hatred, she \nopenly declared she loved him dearly; and, when February came and \nthe Queen did not die, she expressed her impatient opinion that she \nwas too long about it.  However, King Richard was not so far out in \nhis prediction, but, that she died in March - he took good care of \nthat - and then this precious pair hoped to be married.  But they \nwere disappointed, for the idea of such a marriage was so unpopular \nin the country, that the King\'s chief counsellors, RATCLIFFE and \nCATESBY, would by no means undertake to propose it, and the King \nwas even obliged to declare in public that he had never thought of \nsuch a thing.\n\nHe was, by this time, dreaded and hated by all classes of his \nsubjects.  His nobles deserted every day to Henry\'s side; he dared \nnot call another Parliament, lest his crimes should be denounced \nthere; and for want of money, he was obliged to get Benevolences \nfrom the citizens, which exasperated them all against him.  It was \nsaid too, that, being stricken by his conscience, he dreamed \nfrightful dreams, and started up in the night-time, wild with \nterror and remorse.  Active to the last, through all this, he \nissued vigorous proclamations against Henry of Richmond and all his \nfollowers, when he heard that they were coming against him with a \nFleet from France; and took the field as fierce and savage as a \nwild boar - the animal represented on his shield.\n\nHenry of Richmond landed with six thousand men at Milford Haven, \nand came on against King Richard, then encamped at Leicester with \nan army twice as great, through North Wales.  On Bosworth Field the \ntwo armies met; and Richard, looking along Henry\'s ranks, and \nseeing them crowded with the English nobles who had abandoned him, \nturned pale when he beheld the powerful Lord Stanley and his son \n(whom he had tried hard to retain) among them.  But, he was as \nbrave as he was wicked, and plunged into the thickest of the fight.  \nHe was riding hither and thither, laying about him in all \ndirections, when he observed the Earl of Northumberland - one of \nhis few great allies - to stand inactive, and the main body of his \ntroops to hesitate.  At the same moment, his desperate glance \ncaught Henry of Richmond among a little group of his knights.  \nRiding hard at him, and crying \'Treason!\' he killed his standard-\nbearer, fiercely unhorsed another gentleman, and aimed a powerful \nstroke at Henry himself, to cut him down.  But, Sir William Stanley \nparried it as it fell, and before Richard could raise his arm \nagain, he was borne down in a press of numbers, unhorsed, and \nkilled.  Lord Stanley picked up the crown, all bruised and \ntrampled, and stained with blood, and put it upon Richmond\'s head, \namid loud and rejoicing cries of \'Long live King Henry!\'\n\nThat night, a horse was led up to the church of the Grey Friars at \nLeicester; across whose back was tied, like some worthless sack, a \nnaked body brought there for burial.  It was the body of the last \nof the Plantagenet line, King Richard the Third, usurper and \nmurderer, slain at the battle of Bosworth Field in the thirty-\nsecond year of his age, after a reign of two years.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SEVENTH\n\n\n\nKING HENRY THE SEVENTH did not turn out to be as fine a fellow as \nthe nobility and people hoped, in the first joy of their \ndeliverance from Richard the Third.  He was very cold, crafty, and \ncalculating, and would do almost anything for money.  He possessed \nconsiderable ability, but his chief merit appears to have been that \nhe was not cruel when there was nothing to be got by it.\n\nThe new King had promised the nobles who had espoused his cause \nthat he would marry the Princess Elizabeth.  The first thing he \ndid, was, to direct her to be removed from the castle of Sheriff \nHutton in Yorkshire, where Richard had placed her, and restored to \nthe care of her mother in London.  The young Earl of Warwick, \nEdward Plantagenet, son and heir of the late Duke of Clarence, had \nbeen kept a prisoner in the same old Yorkshire Castle with her.  \nThis boy, who was now fifteen, the new King placed in the Tower for \nsafety.  Then he came to London in great state, and gratified the \npeople with a fine procession; on which kind of show he often very \nmuch relied for keeping them in good humour.  The sports and feasts \nwhich took place were followed by a terrible fever, called the \nSweating Sickness; of which great numbers of people died.  Lord \nMayors and Aldermen are thought to have suffered most from it; \nwhether, because they were in the habit of over-eating themselves, \nor because they were very jealous of preserving filth and nuisances \nin the City (as they have been since), I don\'t know.\n\nThe King\'s coronation was postponed on account of the general ill-\nhealth, and he afterwards deferred his marriage, as if he were not \nvery anxious that it should take place:  and, even after that, \ndeferred the Queen\'s coronation so long that he gave offence to the \nYork party.  However, he set these things right in the end, by \nhanging some men and seizing on the rich possessions of others; by \ngranting more popular pardons to the followers of the late King \nthan could, at first, be got from him; and, by employing about his \nCourt, some very scrupulous persons who had been employed in the \nprevious reign.\n\nAs this reign was principally remarkable for two very curious \nimpostures which have become famous in history, we will make those \ntwo stories its principal feature.\n\nThere was a priest at Oxford of the name of Simons, who had for a \npupil a handsome boy named Lambert Simnel, the son of a baker.  \nPartly to gratify his own ambitious ends, and partly to carry out \nthe designs of a secret party formed against the King, this priest \ndeclared that his pupil, the boy, was no other than the young Earl \nof Warwick; who (as everybody might have known) was safely locked \nup in the Tower of London.  The priest and the boy went over to \nIreland; and, at Dublin, enlisted in their cause all ranks of the \npeople:  who seem to have been generous enough, but exceedingly \nirrational.  The Earl of Kildare, the governor of Ireland, declared \nthat he believed the boy to be what the priest represented; and the \nboy, who had been well tutored by the priest, told them such things \nof his childhood, and gave them so many descriptions of the Royal \nFamily, that they were perpetually shouting and hurrahing, and \ndrinking his health, and making all kinds of noisy and thirsty \ndemonstrations, to express their belief in him.  Nor was this \nfeeling confined to Ireland alone, for the Earl of Lincoln - whom \nthe late usurper had named as his successor - went over to the \nyoung Pretender; and, after holding a secret correspondence with \nthe Dowager Duchess of Burgundy - the sister of Edward the Fourth, \nwho detested the present King and all his race - sailed to Dublin \nwith two thousand German soldiers of her providing.  In this \npromising state of the boy\'s fortunes, he was crowned there, with a \ncrown taken off the head of a statue of the Virgin Mary; and was \nthen, according to the Irish custom of those days, carried home on \nthe shoulders of a big chieftain possessing a great deal more \nstrength than sense.  Father Simons, you may be sure, was mighty \nbusy at the coronation.\n\nTen days afterwards, the Germans, and the Irish, and the priest, \nand the boy, and the Earl of Lincoln, all landed in Lancashire to \ninvade England.  The King, who had good intelligence of their \nmovements, set up his standard at Nottingham, where vast numbers \nresorted to him every day; while the Earl of Lincoln could gain but \nvery few.  With his small force he tried to make for the town of \nNewark; but the King\'s army getting between him and that place, he \nhad no choice but to risk a battle at Stoke.  It soon ended in the \ncomplete destruction of the Pretender\'s forces, one half of whom \nwere killed; among them, the Earl himself.  The priest and the \nbaker\'s boy were taken prisoners.  The priest, after confessing the \ntrick, was shut up in prison, where he afterwards died - suddenly \nperhaps.  The boy was taken into the King\'s kitchen and made a \nturnspit.  He was afterwards raised to the station of one of the \nKing\'s falconers; and so ended this strange imposition.\n\nThere seems reason to suspect that the Dowager Queen - always a \nrestless and busy woman - had had some share in tutoring the \nbaker\'s son.  The King was very angry with her, whether or no.  He \nseized upon her property, and shut her up in a convent at \nBermondsey.\n\nOne might suppose that the end of this story would have put the \nIrish people on their guard; but they were quite ready to receive a \nsecond impostor, as they had received the first, and that same \ntroublesome Duchess of Burgundy soon gave them the opportunity.  \nAll of a sudden there appeared at Cork, in a vessel arriving from \nPortugal, a young man of excellent abilities, of very handsome \nappearance and most winning manners, who declared himself to be \nRichard, Duke of York, the second son of King Edward the Fourth.  \n\'O,\' said some, even of those ready Irish believers, \'but surely \nthat young Prince was murdered by his uncle in the Tower!\' - \'It IS \nsupposed so,\' said the engaging young man; \'and my brother WAS \nkilled in that gloomy prison; but I escaped - it don\'t matter how, \nat present - and have been wandering about the world for seven long \nyears.\'  This explanation being quite satisfactory to numbers of \nthe Irish people, they began again to shout and to hurrah, and to \ndrink his health, and to make the noisy and thirsty demonstrations \nall over again.  And the big chieftain in Dublin began to look out \nfor another coronation, and another young King to be carried home \non his back.\n\nNow, King Henry being then on bad terms with France, the French \nKing, Charles the Eighth, saw that, by pretending to believe in the \nhandsome young man, he could trouble his enemy sorely.  So, he \ninvited him over to the French Court, and appointed him a body-\nguard, and treated him in all respects as if he really were the \nDuke of York.  Peace, however, being soon concluded between the two \nKings, the pretended Duke was turned adrift, and wandered for \nprotection to the Duchess of Burgundy.  She, after feigning to \ninquire into the reality of his claims, declared him to be the very \npicture of her dear departed brother; gave him a body-guard at her \nCourt, of thirty halberdiers; and called him by the sounding name \nof the White Rose of England.\n\nThe leading members of the White Rose party in England sent over an \nagent, named Sir Robert Clifford, to ascertain whether the White \nRose\'s claims were good:  the King also sent over his agents to \ninquire into the Rose\'s history.  The White Roses declared the \nyoung man to be really the Duke of York; the King declared him to \nbe PERKIN WARBECK, the son of a merchant of the city of Tournay, \nwho had acquired his knowledge of England, its language and \nmanners, from the English merchants who traded in Flanders; it was \nalso stated by the Royal agents that he had been in the service of \nLady Brompton, the wife of an exiled English nobleman, and that the \nDuchess of Burgundy had caused him to be trained and taught, \nexpressly for this deception.  The King then required the Archduke \nPhilip - who was the sovereign of Burgundy - to banish this new \nPretender, or to deliver him up; but, as the Archduke replied that \nhe could not control the Duchess in her own land, the King, in \nrevenge, took the market of English cloth away from Antwerp, and \nprevented all commercial intercourse between the two countries.\n\nHe also, by arts and bribes, prevailed on Sir Robert Clifford to \nbetray his employers; and he denouncing several famous English \nnoblemen as being secretly the friends of Perkin Warbeck, the King \nhad three of the foremost executed at once.  Whether he pardoned \nthe remainder because they were poor, I do not know; but it is only \ntoo probable that he refused to pardon one famous nobleman against \nwhom the same Clifford soon afterwards informed separately, because \nhe was rich.  This was no other than Sir William Stanley, who had \nsaved the King\'s life at the battle of Bosworth Field.  It is very \ndoubtful whether his treason amounted to much more than his having \nsaid, that if he were sure the young man was the Duke of York, he \nwould not take arms against him.  Whatever he had done he admitted, \nlike an honourable spirit; and he lost his head for it, and the \ncovetous King gained all his wealth.\n\nPerkin Warbeck kept quiet for three years; but, as the Flemings \nbegan to complain heavily of the loss of their trade by the \nstoppage of the Antwerp market on his account, and as it was not \nunlikely that they might even go so far as to take his life, or \ngive him up, he found it necessary to do something.  Accordingly he \nmade a desperate sally, and landed, with only a few hundred men, on \nthe coast of Deal.  But he was soon glad to get back to the place \nfrom whence he came; for the country people rose against his \nfollowers, killed a great many, and took a hundred and fifty \nprisoners:  who were all driven to London, tied together with \nropes, like a team of cattle.  Every one of them was hanged on some \npart or other of the sea-shore; in order, that if any more men \nshould come over with Perkin Warbeck, they might see the bodies as \na warning before they landed.\n\nThen the wary King, by making a treaty of commerce with the \nFlemings, drove Perkin Warbeck out of that country; and, by \ncompletely gaining over the Irish to his side, deprived him of that \nasylum too.  He wandered away to Scotland, and told his story at \nthat Court.  King James the Fourth of Scotland, who was no friend \nto King Henry, and had no reason to be (for King Henry had bribed \nhis Scotch lords to betray him more than once; but had never \nsucceeded in his plots), gave him a great reception, called him his \ncousin, and gave him in marriage the Lady Catherine Gordon, a \nbeautiful and charming creature related to the royal house of \nStuart.\n\nAlarmed by this successful reappearance of the Pretender, the King \nstill undermined, and bought, and bribed, and kept his doings and \nPerkin Warbeck\'s story in the dark, when he might, one would \nimagine, have rendered the matter clear to all England.  But, for \nall this bribing of the Scotch lords at the Scotch King\'s Court, he \ncould not procure the Pretender to be delivered up to him.  James, \nthough not very particular in many respects, would not betray him; \nand the ever-busy Duchess of Burgundy so provided him with arms, \nand good soldiers, and with money besides, that he had soon a \nlittle army of fifteen hundred men of various nations.  With these, \nand aided by the Scottish King in person, he crossed the border \ninto England, and made a proclamation to the people, in which he \ncalled the King \'Henry Tudor;\' offered large rewards to any who \nshould take or distress him; and announced himself as King Richard \nthe Fourth come to receive the homage of his faithful subjects.  \nHis faithful subjects, however, cared nothing for him, and hated \nhis faithful troops:  who, being of different nations, quarrelled \nalso among themselves.  Worse than this, if worse were possible, \nthey began to plunder the country; upon which the White Rose said, \nthat he would rather lose his rights, than gain them through the \nmiseries of the English people.  The Scottish King made a jest of \nhis scruples; but they and their whole force went back again \nwithout fighting a battle.\n\nThe worst consequence of this attempt was, that a rising took place \namong the people of Cornwall, who considered themselves too heavily \ntaxed to meet the charges of the expected war.  Stimulated by \nFlammock, a lawyer, and Joseph, a blacksmith, and joined by Lord \nAudley and some other country gentlemen, they marched on all the \nway to Deptford Bridge, where they fought a battle with the King\'s \narmy.  They were defeated - though the Cornish men fought with \ngreat bravery - and the lord was beheaded, and the lawyer and the \nblacksmith were hanged, drawn, and quartered.  The rest were \npardoned.  The King, who believed every man to be as avaricious as \nhimself, and thought that money could settle anything, allowed them \nto make bargains for their liberty with the soldiers who had taken \nthem.\n\nPerkin Warbeck, doomed to wander up and down, and never to find \nrest anywhere - a sad fate:  almost a sufficient punishment for an \nimposture, which he seems in time to have half believed himself - \nlost his Scottish refuge through a truce being made between the two \nKings; and found himself, once more, without a country before him \nin which he could lay his head.  But James (always honourable and \ntrue to him, alike when he melted down his plate, and even the \ngreat gold chain he had been used to wear, to pay soldiers in his \ncause; and now, when that cause was lost and hopeless) did not \nconclude the treaty, until he had safely departed out of the \nScottish dominions.  He, and his beautiful wife, who was faithful \nto him under all reverses, and left her state and home to follow \nhis poor fortunes, were put aboard ship with everything necessary \nfor their comfort and protection, and sailed for Ireland.\n\nBut, the Irish people had had enough of counterfeit Earls of \nWarwick and Dukes of York, for one while; and would give the White \nRose no aid.  So, the White Rose - encircled by thorns indeed - \nresolved to go with his beautiful wife to Cornwall as a forlorn \nresource, and see what might be made of the Cornish men, who had \nrisen so valiantly a little while before, and who had fought so \nbravely at Deptford Bridge.\n\nTo Whitsand Bay, in Cornwall, accordingly, came Perkin Warbeck and \nhis wife; and the lovely lady he shut up for safety in the Castle \nof St. Michael\'s Mount, and then marched into Devonshire at the \nhead of three thousand Cornishmen.  These were increased to six \nthousand by the time of his arrival in Exeter; but, there the \npeople made a stout resistance, and he went on to Taunton, where he \ncame in sight of the King\'s army.  The stout Cornish men, although \nthey were few in number, and badly armed, were so bold, that they \nnever thought of retreating; but bravely looked forward to a battle \non the morrow.  Unhappily for them, the man who was possessed of so \nmany engaging qualities, and who attracted so many people to his \nside when he had nothing else with which to tempt them, was not as \nbrave as they.  In the night, when the two armies lay opposite to \neach other, he mounted a swift horse and fled.  When morning \ndawned, the poor confiding Cornish men, discovering that they had \nno leader, surrendered to the King\'s power.  Some of them were \nhanged, and the rest were pardoned and went miserably home.\n\nBefore the King pursued Perkin Warbeck to the sanctuary of Beaulieu \nin the New Forest, where it was soon known that he had taken \nrefuge, he sent a body of horsemen to St. Michael\'s Mount, to seize \nhis wife.  She was soon taken and brought as a captive before the \nKing.  But she was so beautiful, and so good, and so devoted to the \nman in whom she believed, that the King regarded her with \ncompassion, treated her with great respect, and placed her at \nCourt, near the Queen\'s person.  And many years after Perkin \nWarbeck was no more, and when his strange story had become like a \nnursery tale, SHE was called the White Rose, by the people, in \nremembrance of her beauty.\n\nThe sanctuary at Beaulieu was soon surrounded by the King\'s men; \nand the King, pursuing his usual dark, artful ways, sent pretended \nfriends to Perkin Warbeck to persuade him to come out and surrender \nhimself.  This he soon did; the King having taken a good look at \nthe man of whom he had heard so much - from behind a screen - \ndirected him to be well mounted, and to ride behind him at a little \ndistance, guarded, but not bound in any way.  So they entered \nLondon with the King\'s favourite show - a procession; and some of \nthe people hooted as the Pretender rode slowly through the streets \nto the Tower; but the greater part were quiet, and very curious to \nsee him.  From the Tower, he was taken to the Palace at \nWestminster, and there lodged like a gentleman, though closely \nwatched.  He was examined every now and then as to his imposture; \nbut the King was so secret in all he did, that even then he gave it \na consequence, which it cannot be supposed to have in itself \ndeserved.\n\nAt last Perkin Warbeck ran away, and took refuge in another \nsanctuary near Richmond in Surrey.  From this he was again \npersuaded to deliver himself up; and, being conveyed to London, he \nstood in the stocks for a whole day, outside Westminster Hall, and \nthere read a paper purporting to be his full confession, and \nrelating his history as the King\'s agents had originally described \nit.  He was then shut up in the Tower again, in the company of the \nEarl of Warwick, who had now been there for fourteen years:  ever \nsince his removal out of Yorkshire, except when the King had had \nhim at Court, and had shown him to the people, to prove the \nimposture of the Baker\'s boy.  It is but too probable, when we \nconsider the crafty character of Henry the Seventh, that these two \nwere brought together for a cruel purpose.  A plot was soon \ndiscovered between them and the keepers, to murder the Governor, \nget possession of the keys, and proclaim Perkin Warbeck as King \nRichard the Fourth.  That there was some such plot, is likely; that \nthey were tempted into it, is at least as likely; that the \nunfortunate Earl of Warwick - last male of the Plantagenet line - \nwas too unused to the world, and too ignorant and simple to know \nmuch about it, whatever it was, is perfectly certain; and that it \nwas the King\'s interest to get rid of him, is no less so.  He was \nbeheaded on Tower Hill, and Perkin Warbeck was hanged at Tyburn.\n\nSuch was the end of the pretended Duke of York, whose shadowy \nhistory was made more shadowy - and ever will be - by the mystery \nand craft of the King.  If he had turned his great natural \nadvantages to a more honest account, he might have lived a happy \nand respected life, even in those days.  But he died upon a gallows \nat Tyburn, leaving the Scottish lady, who had loved him so well, \nkindly protected at the Queen\'s Court.  After some time she forgot \nher old loves and troubles, as many people do with Time\'s merciful \nassistance, and married a Welsh gentleman.  Her second husband, SIR \nMATTHEW CRADOC, more honest and more happy than her first, lies \nbeside her in a tomb in the old church of Swansea.\n\nThe ill-blood between France and England in this reign, arose out \nof the continued plotting of the Duchess of Burgundy, and disputes \nrespecting the affairs of Brittany.  The King feigned to be very \npatriotic, indignant, and warlike; but he always contrived so as \nnever to make war in reality, and always to make money.  His \ntaxation of the people, on pretence of war with France, involved, \nat one time, a very dangerous insurrection, headed by Sir John \nEgremont, and a common man called John a Chambre.  But it was \nsubdued by the royal forces, under the command of the Earl of \nSurrey.  The knighted John escaped to the Duchess of Burgundy, who \nwas ever ready to receive any one who gave the King trouble; and \nthe plain John was hanged at York, in the midst of a number of his \nmen, but on a much higher gibbet, as being a greater traitor.  Hung \nhigh or hung low, however, hanging is much the same to the person \nhung.\n\nWithin a year after her marriage, the Queen had given birth to a \nson, who was called Prince Arthur, in remembrance of the old \nBritish prince of romance and story; and who, when all these events \nhad happened, being then in his fifteenth year, was married to \nCATHERINE, the daughter of the Spanish monarch, with great \nrejoicings and bright prospects; but in a very few months he \nsickened and died.  As soon as the King had recovered from his \ngrief, he thought it a pity that the fortune of the Spanish \nPrincess, amounting to two hundred thousand crowns, should go out \nof the family; and therefore arranged that the young widow should \nmarry his second son HENRY, then twelve years of age, when he too \nshould be fifteen.  There were objections to this marriage on the \npart of the clergy; but, as the infallible Pope was gained over, \nand, as he MUST be right, that settled the business for the time.  \nThe King\'s eldest daughter was provided for, and a long course of \ndisturbance was considered to be set at rest, by her being married \nto the Scottish King.\n\nAnd now the Queen died.  When the King had got over that grief too, \nhis mind once more reverted to his darling money for consolation, \nand he thought of marrying the Dowager Queen of Naples, who was \nimmensely rich:  but, as it turned out not to be practicable to \ngain the money however practicable it might have been to gain the \nlady, he gave up the idea.  He was not so fond of her but that he \nsoon proposed to marry the Dowager Duchess of Savoy; and, soon \nafterwards, the widow of the King of Castile, who was raving mad.  \nBut he made a money-bargain instead, and married neither.\n\nThe Duchess of Burgundy, among the other discontented people to \nwhom she had given refuge, had sheltered EDMUND DE LA POLE (younger \nbrother of that Earl of Lincoln who was killed at Stoke), now Earl \nof Suffolk.  The King had prevailed upon him to return to the \nmarriage of Prince Arthur; but, he soon afterwards went away again; \nand then the King, suspecting a conspiracy, resorted to his \nfavourite plan of sending him some treacherous friends, and buying \nof those scoundrels the secrets they disclosed or invented.  Some \narrests and executions took place in consequence.  In the end, the \nKing, on a promise of not taking his life, obtained possession of \nthe person of Edmund de la Pole, and shut him up in the Tower.\n\nThis was his last enemy.  If he had lived much longer he would have \nmade many more among the people, by the grinding exaction to which \nhe constantly exposed them, and by the tyrannical acts of his two \nprime favourites in all money-raising matters, EDMUND DUDLEY and \nRICHARD EMPSON.  But Death - the enemy who is not to be bought off \nor deceived, and on whom no money, and no treachery has any effect \n- presented himself at this juncture, and ended the King\'s reign.  \nHe died of the gout, on the twenty-second of April, one thousand \nfive hundred and nine, and in the fifty-third year of his age, \nafter reigning twenty-four years; he was buried in the beautiful \nChapel of Westminster Abbey, which he had himself founded, and \nwhich still bears his name.\n\nIt was in this reign that the great CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, on behalf \nof Spain, discovered what was then called The New World.  Great \nwonder, interest, and hope of wealth being awakened in England \nthereby, the King and the merchants of London and Bristol fitted \nout an English expedition for further discoveries in the New World, \nand entrusted it to SEBASTIAN CABOT, of Bristol, the son of a \nVenetian pilot there.  He was very successful in his voyage, and \ngained high reputation, both for himself and England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH, CALLED BLUFF KING \nHAL AND BURLY KING HARRY\n\n\n\nPART THE FIRST\n\n\nWE now come to King Henry the Eighth, whom it has been too much the \nfashion to call \'Bluff King Hal,\' and \'Burly King Harry,\' and other \nfine names; but whom I shall take the liberty to call, plainly, one \nof the most detestable villains that ever drew breath.  You will be \nable to judge, long before we come to the end of his life, whether \nhe deserves the character.\n\nHe was just eighteen years of age when he came to the throne.  \nPeople said he was handsome then; but I don\'t believe it.  He was a \nbig, burly, noisy, small-eyed, large-faced, double-chinned, \nswinish-looking fellow in later life (as we know from the \nlikenesses of him, painted by the famous HANS HOLBEIN), and it is \nnot easy to believe that so bad a character can ever have been \nveiled under a prepossessing appearance.\n\nHe was anxious to make himself popular; and the people, who had \nlong disliked the late King, were very willing to believe that he \ndeserved to be so.  He was extremely fond of show and display, and \nso were they.  Therefore there was great rejoicing when he married \nthe Princess Catherine, and when they were both crowned.  And the \nKing fought at tournaments and always came off victorious - for the \ncourtiers took care of that - and there was a general outcry that \nhe was a wonderful man.  Empson, Dudley, and their supporters were \naccused of a variety of crimes they had never committed, instead of \nthe offences of which they really had been guilty; and they were \npilloried, and set upon horses with their faces to the tails, and \nknocked about and beheaded, to the satisfaction of the people, and \nthe enrichment of the King.\n\nThe Pope, so indefatigable in getting the world into trouble, had \nmixed himself up in a war on the continent of Europe, occasioned by \nthe reigning Princes of little quarrelling states in Italy having \nat various times married into other Royal families, and so led to \nTHEIR claiming a share in those petty Governments.  The King, who \ndiscovered that he was very fond of the Pope, sent a herald to the \nKing of France, to say that he must not make war upon that holy \npersonage, because he was the father of all Christians.  As the \nFrench King did not mind this relationship in the least, and also \nrefused to admit a claim King Henry made to certain lands in \nFrance, war was declared between the two countries.  Not to perplex \nthis story with an account of the tricks and designs of all the \nsovereigns who were engaged in it, it is enough to say that England \nmade a blundering alliance with Spain, and got stupidly taken in by \nthat country; which made its own terms with France when it could \nand left England in the lurch.  SIR EDWARD HOWARD, a bold admiral, \nson of the Earl of Surrey, distinguished himself by his bravery \nagainst the French in this business; but, unfortunately, he was \nmore brave than wise, for, skimming into the French harbour of \nBrest with only a few row-boats, he attempted (in revenge for the \ndefeat and death of SIR THOMAS KNYVETT, another bold English \nadmiral) to take some strong French ships, well defended with \nbatteries of cannon.  The upshot was, that he was left on board of \none of them (in consequence of its shooting away from his own \nboat), with not more than about a dozen men, and was thrown into \nthe sea and drowned:  though not until he had taken from his breast \nhis gold chain and gold whistle, which were the signs of his \noffice, and had cast them into the sea to prevent their being made \na boast of by the enemy.  After this defeat - which was a great \none, for Sir Edward Howard was a man of valour and fame - the King \ntook it into his head to invade France in person; first executing \nthat dangerous Earl of Suffolk whom his father had left in the \nTower, and appointing Queen Catherine to the charge of his kingdom \nin his absence.  He sailed to Calais, where he was joined by \nMAXIMILIAN, Emperor of Germany, who pretended to be his soldier, \nand who took pay in his service:  with a good deal of nonsense of \nthat sort, flattering enough to the vanity of a vain blusterer.  \nThe King might be successful enough in sham fights; but his idea of \nreal battles chiefly consisted in pitching silken tents of bright \ncolours that were ignominiously blown down by the wind, and in \nmaking a vast display of gaudy flags and golden curtains.  Fortune, \nhowever, favoured him better than he deserved; for, after much \nwaste of time in tent pitching, flag flying, gold curtaining, and \nother such masquerading, he gave the French battle at a place \ncalled Guinegate:  where they took such an unaccountable panic, and \nfled with such swiftness, that it was ever afterwards called by the \nEnglish the Battle of Spurs.  Instead of following up his \nadvantage, the King, finding that he had had enough of real \nfighting, came home again.\n\nThe Scottish King, though nearly related to Henry by marriage, had \ntaken part against him in this war.  The Earl of Surrey, as the \nEnglish general, advanced to meet him when he came out of his own \ndominions and crossed the river Tweed.  The two armies came up with \none another when the Scottish King had also crossed the river Till, \nand was encamped upon the last of the Cheviot Hills, called the \nHill of Flodden.  Along the plain below it, the English, when the \nhour of battle came, advanced.  The Scottish army, which had been \ndrawn up in five great bodies, then came steadily down in perfect \nsilence.  So they, in their turn, advanced to meet the English \narmy, which came on in one long line; and they attacked it with a \nbody of spearmen, under LORD HOME.  At first they had the best of \nit; but the English recovered themselves so bravely, and fought \nwith such valour, that, when the Scottish King had almost made his \nway up to the Royal Standard, he was slain, and the whole Scottish \npower routed.  Ten thousand Scottish men lay dead that day on \nFlodden Field; and among them, numbers of the nobility and gentry.  \nFor a long time afterwards, the Scottish peasantry used to believe \nthat their King had not been really killed in this battle, because \nno Englishman had found an iron belt he wore about his body as a \npenance for having been an unnatural and undutiful son.  But, \nwhatever became of his belt, the English had his sword and dagger, \nand the ring from his finger, and his body too, covered with \nwounds.  There is no doubt of it; for it was seen and recognised by \nEnglish gentlemen who had known the Scottish King well.\n\nWhen King Henry was making ready to renew the war in France, the \nFrench King was contemplating peace.  His queen, dying at this \ntime, he proposed, though he was upwards of fifty years old, to \nmarry King Henry\'s sister, the Princess Mary, who, besides being \nonly sixteen, was betrothed to the Duke of Suffolk.  As the \ninclinations of young Princesses were not much considered in such \nmatters, the marriage was concluded, and the poor girl was escorted \nto France, where she was immediately left as the French King\'s \nbride, with only one of all her English attendants.  That one was a \npretty young girl named ANNE BOLEYN, niece of the Earl of Surrey, \nwho had been made Duke of Norfolk, after the victory of Flodden \nField.  Anne Boleyn\'s is a name to be remembered, as you will \npresently find.\n\nAnd now the French King, who was very proud of his young wife, was \npreparing for many years of happiness, and she was looking forward, \nI dare say, to many years of misery, when he died within three \nmonths, and left her a young widow.  The new French monarch, \nFRANCIS THE FIRST, seeing how important it was to his interests \nthat she should take for her second husband no one but an \nEnglishman, advised her first lover, the Duke of Suffolk, when King \nHenry sent him over to France to fetch her home, to marry her.  The \nPrincess being herself so fond of that Duke, as to tell him that he \nmust either do so then, or for ever lose her, they were wedded; and \nHenry afterwards forgave them.  In making interest with the King, \nthe Duke of Suffolk had addressed his most powerful favourite and \nadviser, THOMAS WOLSEY - a name very famous in history for its rise \nand downfall.\n\nWolsey was the son of a respectable butcher at Ipswich, in Suffolk \nand received so excellent an education that he became a tutor to \nthe family of the Marquis of Dorset, who afterwards got him \nappointed one of the late King\'s chaplains.  On the accession of \nHenry the Eighth, he was promoted and taken into great favour.  He \nwas now Archbishop of York; the Pope had made him a Cardinal \nbesides; and whoever wanted influence in England or favour with the \nKing - whether he were a foreign monarch or an English nobleman - \nwas obliged to make a friend of the great Cardinal Wolsey.\n\nHe was a gay man, who could dance and jest, and sing and drink; and \nthose were the roads to so much, or rather so little, of a heart as \nKing Henry had.  He was wonderfully fond of pomp and glitter, and \nso was the King.  He knew a good deal of the Church learning of \nthat time; much of which consisted in finding artful excuses and \npretences for almost any wrong thing, and in arguing that black was \nwhite, or any other colour.  This kind of learning pleased the King \ntoo.  For many such reasons, the Cardinal was high in estimation \nwith the King; and, being a man of far greater ability, knew as \nwell how to manage him, as a clever keeper may know how to manage a \nwolf or a tiger, or any other cruel and uncertain beast, that may \nturn upon him and tear him any day.  Never had there been seen in \nEngland such state as my Lord Cardinal kept.  His wealth was \nenormous; equal, it was reckoned, to the riches of the Crown.  His \npalaces were as splendid as the King\'s, and his retinue was eight \nhundred strong.  He held his Court, dressed out from top to toe in \nflaming scarlet; and his very shoes were golden, set with precious \nstones.  His followers rode on blood horses; while he, with a \nwonderful affectation of humility in the midst of his great \nsplendour, ambled on a mule with a red velvet saddle and bridle and \ngolden stirrups.\n\nThrough the influence of this stately priest, a grand meeting was \narranged to take place between the French and English Kings in \nFrance; but on ground belonging to England.  A prodigious show of \nfriendship and rejoicing was to be made on the occasion; and \nheralds were sent to proclaim with brazen trumpets through all the \nprincipal cities of Europe, that, on a certain day, the Kings of \nFrance and England, as companions and brothers in arms, each \nattended by eighteen followers, would hold a tournament against all \nknights who might choose to come.\n\nCHARLES, the new Emperor of Germany (the old one being dead), \nwanted to prevent too cordial an alliance between these sovereigns, \nand came over to England before the King could repair to the place \nof meeting; and, besides making an agreeable impression upon him, \nsecured Wolsey\'s interest by promising that his influence should \nmake him Pope when the next vacancy occurred.  On the day when the \nEmperor left England, the King and all the Court went over to \nCalais, and thence to the place of meeting, between Ardres and \nGuisnes, commonly called the Field of the Cloth of Gold.  Here, all \nmanner of expense and prodigality was lavished on the decorations \nof the show; many of the knights and gentlemen being so superbly \ndressed that it was said they carried their whole estates upon \ntheir shoulders.\n\nThere were sham castles, temporary chapels, fountains running wine, \ngreat cellars full of wine free as water to all comers, silk tents, \ngold lace and foil, gilt lions, and such things without end; and, \nin the midst of all, the rich Cardinal out-shone and out-glittered \nall the noblemen and gentlemen assembled.  After a treaty made \nbetween the two Kings with as much solemnity as if they had \nintended to keep it, the lists - nine hundred feet long, and three \nhundred and twenty broad - were opened for the tournament; the \nQueens of France and England looking on with great array of lords \nand ladies.  Then, for ten days, the two sovereigns fought five \ncombats every day, and always beat their polite adversaries; though \nthey DO write that the King of England, being thrown in a wrestle \none day by the King of France, lost his kingly temper with his \nbrother-in-arms, and wanted to make a quarrel of it.  Then, there \nis a great story belonging to this Field of the Cloth of Gold, \nshowing how the English were distrustful of the French, and the \nFrench of the English, until Francis rode alone one morning to \nHenry\'s tent; and, going in before he was out of bed, told him in \njoke that he was his prisoner; and how Henry jumped out of bed and \nembraced Francis; and how Francis helped Henry to dress, and warmed \nhis linen for him; and how Henry gave Francis a splendid jewelled \ncollar, and how Francis gave Henry, in return, a costly bracelet.  \nAll this and a great deal more was so written about, and sung \nabout, and talked about at that time (and, indeed, since that time \ntoo), that the world has had good cause to be sick of it, for ever.\n\nOf course, nothing came of all these fine doings but a speedy \nrenewal of the war between England and France, in which the two \nRoyal companions and brothers in arms longed very earnestly to \ndamage one another.  But, before it broke out again, the Duke of \nBuckingham was shamefully executed on Tower Hill, on the evidence \nof a discharged servant - really for nothing, except the folly of \nhaving believed in a friar of the name of HOPKINS, who had \npretended to be a prophet, and who had mumbled and jumbled out some \nnonsense about the Duke\'s son being destined to be very great in \nthe land.  It was believed that the unfortunate Duke had given \noffence to the great Cardinal by expressing his mind freely about \nthe expense and absurdity of the whole business of the Field of the \nCloth of Gold.  At any rate, he was beheaded, as I have said, for \nnothing.  And the people who saw it done were very angry, and cried \nout that it was the work of \'the butcher\'s son!\'\n\nThe new war was a short one, though the Earl of Surrey invaded \nFrance again, and did some injury to that country.  It ended in \nanother treaty of peace between the two kingdoms, and in the \ndiscovery that the Emperor of Germany was not such a good friend to \nEngland in reality, as he pretended to be.  Neither did he keep his \npromise to Wolsey to make him Pope, though the King urged him.  Two \nPopes died in pretty quick succession; but the foreign priests were \ntoo much for the Cardinal, and kept him out of the post.  So the \nCardinal and King together found out that the Emperor of Germany \nwas not a man to keep faith with; broke off a projected marriage \nbetween the King\'s daughter MARY, Princess of Wales, and that \nsovereign; and began to consider whether it might not be well to \nmarry the young lady, either to Francis himself, or to his eldest \nson.\n\nThere now arose at Wittemberg, in Germany, the great leader of the \nmighty change in England which is called The Reformation, and which \nset the people free from their slavery to the priests.  This was a \nlearned Doctor, named MARTIN LUTHER, who knew all about them, for \nhe had been a priest, and even a monk, himself.  The preaching and \nwriting of Wickliffe had set a number of men thinking on this \nsubject; and Luther, finding one day to his great surprise, that \nthere really was a book called the New Testament which the priests \ndid not allow to be read, and which contained truths that they \nsuppressed, began to be very vigorous against the whole body, from \nthe Pope downward.  It happened, while he was yet only beginning \nhis vast work of awakening the nation, that an impudent fellow \nnamed TETZEL, a friar of very bad character, came into his \nneighbourhood selling what were called Indulgences, by wholesale, \nto raise money for beautifying the great Cathedral of St. Peter\'s, \nat Rome.  Whoever bought an Indulgence of the Pope was supposed to \nbuy himself off from the punishment of Heaven for his offences.  \nLuther told the people that these Indulgences were worthless bits \nof paper, before God, and that Tetzel and his masters were a crew \nof impostors in selling them.\n\nThe King and the Cardinal were mightily indignant at this \npresumption; and the King (with the help of SIR THOMAS MORE, a wise \nman, whom he afterwards repaid by striking off his head) even wrote \na book about it, with which the Pope was so well pleased that he \ngave the King the title of Defender of the Faith.  The King and the \nCardinal also issued flaming warnings to the people not to read \nLuther\'s books, on pain of excommunication.  But they did read them \nfor all that; and the rumour of what was in them spread far and \nwide.\n\nWhen this great change was thus going on, the King began to show \nhimself in his truest and worst colours.  Anne Boleyn, the pretty \nlittle girl who had gone abroad to France with his sister, was by \nthis time grown up to be very beautiful, and was one of the ladies \nin attendance on Queen Catherine.  Now, Queen Catherine was no \nlonger young or handsome, and it is likely that she was not \nparticularly good-tempered; having been always rather melancholy, \nand having been made more so by the deaths of four of her children \nwhen they were very young.  So, the King fell in love with the fair \nAnne Boleyn, and said to himself, \'How can I be best rid of my own \ntroublesome wife whom I am tired of, and marry Anne?\'\n\nYou recollect that Queen Catherine had been the wife of Henry\'s \nbrother.  What does the King do, after thinking it over, but calls \nhis favourite priests about him, and says, O! his mind is in such a \ndreadful state, and he is so frightfully uneasy, because he is \nafraid it was not lawful for him to marry the Queen!  Not one of \nthose priests had the courage to hint that it was rather curious he \nhad never thought of that before, and that his mind seemed to have \nbeen in a tolerably jolly condition during a great many years, in \nwhich he certainly had not fretted himself thin; but, they all \nsaid, Ah! that was very true, and it was a serious business; and \nperhaps the best way to make it right, would be for his Majesty to \nbe divorced!  The King replied, Yes, he thought that would be the \nbest way, certainly; so they all went to work.\n\nIf I were to relate to you the intrigues and plots that took place \nin the endeavour to get this divorce, you would think the History \nof England the most tiresome book in the world.  So I shall say no \nmore, than that after a vast deal of negotiation and evasion, the \nPope issued a commission to Cardinal Wolsey and CARDINAL CAMPEGGIO \n(whom he sent over from Italy for the purpose), to try the whole \ncase in England.  It is supposed - and I think with reason - that \nWolsey was the Queen\'s enemy, because she had reproved him for his \nproud and gorgeous manner of life.  But, he did not at first know \nthat the King wanted to marry Anne Boleyn; and when he did know it, \nhe even went down on his knees, in the endeavour to dissuade him.\n\nThe Cardinals opened their court in the Convent of the Black \nFriars, near to where the bridge of that name in London now stands; \nand the King and Queen, that they might be near it, took up their \nlodgings at the adjoining palace of Bridewell, of which nothing now \nremains but a bad prison.  On the opening of the court, when the \nKing and Queen were called on to appear, that poor ill-used lady, \nwith a dignity and firmness and yet with a womanly affection worthy \nto be always admired, went and kneeled at the King\'s feet, and said \nthat she had come, a stranger, to his dominions; that she had been \na good and true wife to him for twenty years; and that she could \nacknowledge no power in those Cardinals to try whether she should \nbe considered his wife after all that time, or should be put away.  \nWith that, she got up and left the court, and would never \nafterwards come back to it.\n\nThe King pretended to be very much overcome, and said, O! my lords \nand gentlemen, what a good woman she was to be sure, and how \ndelighted he would be to live with her unto death, but for that \nterrible uneasiness in his mind which was quite wearing him away!  \nSo, the case went on, and there was nothing but talk for two \nmonths.  Then Cardinal Campeggio, who, on behalf of the Pope, \nwanted nothing so much as delay, adjourned it for two more months; \nand before that time was elapsed, the Pope himself adjourned it \nindefinitely, by requiring the King and Queen to come to Rome and \nhave it tried there.  But by good luck for the King, word was \nbrought to him by some of his people, that they had happened to \nmeet at supper, THOMAS CRANMER, a learned Doctor of Cambridge, who \nhad proposed to urge the Pope on, by referring the case to all the \nlearned doctors and bishops, here and there and everywhere, and \ngetting their opinions that the King\'s marriage was unlawful.  The \nKing, who was now in a hurry to marry Anne Boleyn, thought this \nsuch a good idea, that he sent for Cranmer, post haste, and said to \nLORD ROCHFORT, Anne Boleyn\'s father, \'Take this learned Doctor down \nto your country-house, and there let him have a good room for a \nstudy, and no end of books out of which to prove that I may marry \nyour daughter.\'  Lord Rochfort, not at all reluctant, made the \nlearned Doctor as comfortable as he could; and the learned Doctor \nwent to work to prove his case.  All this time, the King and Anne \nBoleyn were writing letters to one another almost daily, full of \nimpatience to have the case settled; and Anne Boleyn was showing \nherself (as I think) very worthy of the fate which afterwards befel \nher.\n\nIt was bad for Cardinal Wolsey that he had left Cranmer to render \nthis help.  It was worse for him that he had tried to dissuade the \nKing from marrying Anne Boleyn.  Such a servant as he, to such a \nmaster as Henry, would probably have fallen in any case; but, \nbetween the hatred of the party of the Queen that was, and the \nhatred of the party of the Queen that was to be, he fell suddenly \nand heavily.  Going down one day to the Court of Chancery, where he \nnow presided, he was waited upon by the Dukes of Norfolk and \nSuffolk, who told him that they brought an order to him to resign \nthat office, and to withdraw quietly to a house he had at Esher, in \nSurrey.  The Cardinal refusing, they rode off to the King; and next \nday came back with a letter from him, on reading which, the \nCardinal submitted.  An inventory was made out of all the riches in \nhis palace at York Place (now Whitehall), and he went sorrowfully \nup the river, in his barge, to Putney.  An abject man he was, in \nspite of his pride; for being overtaken, riding out of that place \ntowards Esher, by one of the King\'s chamberlains who brought him a \nkind message and a ring, he alighted from his mule, took off his \ncap, and kneeled down in the dirt.  His poor Fool, whom in his \nprosperous days he had always kept in his palace to entertain him, \ncut a far better figure than he; for, when the Cardinal said to the \nchamberlain that he had nothing to send to his lord the King as a \npresent, but that jester who was a most excellent one, it took six \nstrong yeomen to remove the faithful fool from his master.\n\nThe once proud Cardinal was soon further disgraced, and wrote the \nmost abject letters to his vile sovereign; who humbled him one day \nand encouraged him the next, according to his humour, until he was \nat last ordered to go and reside in his diocese of York.  He said \nhe was too poor; but I don\'t know how he made that out, for he took \na hundred and sixty servants with him, and seventy-two cart-loads \nof furniture, food, and wine.  He remained in that part of the \ncountry for the best part of a year, and showed himself so improved \nby his misfortunes, and was so mild and so conciliating, that he \nwon all hearts.  And indeed, even in his proud days, he had done \nsome magnificent things for learning and education.  At last, he \nwas arrested for high treason; and, coming slowly on his journey \ntowards London, got as far as Leicester.  Arriving at Leicester \nAbbey after dark, and very ill, he said - when the monks came out \nat the gate with lighted torches to receive him - that he had come \nto lay his bones among them.  He had indeed; for he was taken to a \nbed, from which he never rose again.  His last words were, \'Had I \nbut served God as diligently as I have served the King, He would \nnot have given me over, in my grey hairs.  Howbeit, this is my just \nreward for my pains and diligence, not regarding my service to God, \nbut only my duty to my prince.\'  The news of his death was quickly \ncarried to the King, who was amusing himself with archery in the \ngarden of the magnificent Palace at Hampton Court, which that very \nWolsey had presented to him.  The greatest emotion his royal mind \ndisplayed at the loss of a servant so faithful and so ruined, was a \nparticular desire to lay hold of fifteen hundred pounds which the \nCardinal was reported to have hidden somewhere.\n\nThe opinions concerning the divorce, of the learned doctors and \nbishops and others, being at last collected, and being generally in \nthe King\'s favour, were forwarded to the Pope, with an entreaty \nthat he would now grant it.  The unfortunate Pope, who was a timid \nman, was half distracted between his fear of his authority being \nset aside in England if he did not do as he was asked, and his \ndread of offending the Emperor of Germany, who was Queen \nCatherine\'s nephew.  In this state of mind he still evaded and did \nnothing.  Then, THOMAS CROMWELL, who had been one of Wolsey\'s \nfaithful attendants, and had remained so even in his decline, \nadvised the King to take the matter into his own hands, and make \nhimself the head of the whole Church.  This, the King by various \nartful means, began to do; but he recompensed the clergy by \nallowing them to burn as many people as they pleased, for holding \nLuther\'s opinions.  You must understand that Sir Thomas More, the \nwise man who had helped the King with his book, had been made \nChancellor in Wolsey\'s place.  But, as he was truly attached to the \nChurch as it was even in its abuses, he, in this state of things, \nresigned.\n\nBeing now quite resolved to get rid of Queen Catherine, and to \nmarry Anne Boleyn without more ado, the King made Cranmer \nArchbishop of Canterbury, and directed Queen Catherine to leave the \nCourt.  She obeyed; but replied that wherever she went, she was \nQueen of England still, and would remain so, to the last.  The King \nthen married Anne Boleyn privately; and the new Archbishop of \nCanterbury, within half a year, declared his marriage with Queen \nCatherine void, and crowned Anne Boleyn Queen.\n\nShe might have known that no good could ever come from such wrong, \nand that the corpulent brute who had been so faithless and so cruel \nto his first wife, could be more faithless and more cruel to his \nsecond.  She might have known that, even when he was in love with \nher, he had been a mean and selfish coward, running away, like a \nfrightened cur, from her society and her house, when a dangerous \nsickness broke out in it, and when she might easily have taken it \nand died, as several of the household did.  But, Anne Boleyn \narrived at all this knowledge too late, and bought it at a dear \nprice.  Her bad marriage with a worse man came to its natural end.  \nIts natural end was not, as we shall too soon see, a natural death \nfor her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH\n\n\n\nPART THE SECOND\n\n\nTHE Pope was thrown into a very angry state of mind when he heard \nof the King\'s marriage, and fumed exceedingly.  Many of the English \nmonks and friars, seeing that their order was in danger, did the \nsame; some even declaimed against the King in church before his \nface, and were not to be stopped until he himself roared out \n\'Silence!\'  The King, not much the worse for this, took it pretty \nquietly; and was very glad when his Queen gave birth to a daughter, \nwho was christened ELIZABETH, and declared Princess of Wales as her \nsister Mary had already been.\n\nOne of the most atrocious features of this reign was that Henry the \nEighth was always trimming between the reformed religion and the \nunreformed one; so that the more he quarrelled with the Pope, the \nmore of his own subjects he roasted alive for not holding the \nPope\'s opinions.  Thus, an unfortunate student named John Frith, \nand a poor simple tailor named Andrew Hewet who loved him very \nmuch, and said that whatever John Frith believed HE believed, were \nburnt in Smithfield - to show what a capital Christian the King \nwas.\n\nBut, these were speedily followed by two much greater victims, Sir \nThomas More, and John Fisher, the Bishop of Rochester.  The latter, \nwho was a good and amiable old man, had committed no greater \noffence than believing in Elizabeth Barton, called the Maid of Kent \n- another of those ridiculous women who pretended to be inspired, \nand to make all sorts of heavenly revelations, though they indeed \nuttered nothing but evil nonsense.  For this offence - as it was \npretended, but really for denying the King to be the supreme Head \nof the Church - he got into trouble, and was put in prison; but, \neven then, he might have been suffered to die naturally (short work \nhaving been made of executing the Kentish Maid and her principal \nfollowers), but that the Pope, to spite the King, resolved to make \nhim a cardinal.  Upon that the King made a ferocious joke to the \neffect that the Pope might send Fisher a red hat - which is the way \nthey make a cardinal - but he should have no head on which to wear \nit; and he was tried with all unfairness and injustice, and \nsentenced to death.  He died like a noble and virtuous old man, and \nleft a worthy name behind him.  The King supposed, I dare say, that \nSir Thomas More would be frightened by this example; but, as he was \nnot to be easily terrified, and, thoroughly believing in the Pope, \nhad made up his mind that the King was not the rightful Head of the \nChurch, he positively refused to say that he was.  For this crime \nhe too was tried and sentenced, after having been in prison a whole \nyear.  When he was doomed to death, and came away from his trial \nwith the edge of the executioner\'s axe turned towards him - as was \nalways done in those times when a state prisoner came to that \nhopeless pass - he bore it quite serenely, and gave his blessing to \nhis son, who pressed through the crowd in Westminster Hall and \nkneeled down to receive it.  But, when he got to the Tower Wharf on \nhis way back to his prison, and his favourite daughter, MARGARET \nROPER, a very good woman, rushed through the guards again and \nagain, to kiss him and to weep upon his neck, he was overcome at \nlast.  He soon recovered, and never more showed any feeling but \ncheerfulness and courage.  When he was going up the steps of the \nscaffold to his death, he said jokingly to the Lieutenant of the \nTower, observing that they were weak and shook beneath his tread, \n\'I pray you, master Lieutenant, see me safe up; and, for my coming \ndown, I can shift for myself.\'  Also he said to the executioner, \nafter he had laid his head upon the block, \'Let me put my beard out \nof the way; for that, at least, has never committed any treason.\'  \nThen his head was struck off at a blow.  These two executions were \nworthy of King Henry the Eighth.  Sir Thomas More was one of the \nmost virtuous men in his dominions, and the Bishop was one of his \noldest and truest friends.  But to be a friend of that fellow was \nalmost as dangerous as to be his wife.\n\nWhen the news of these two murders got to Rome, the Pope raged \nagainst the murderer more than ever Pope raged since the world \nbegan, and prepared a Bull, ordering his subjects to take arms \nagainst him and dethrone him.  The King took all possible \nprecautions to keep that document out of his dominions, and set to \nwork in return to suppress a great number of the English \nmonasteries and abbeys.\n\nThis destruction was begun by a body of commissioners, of whom \nCromwell (whom the King had taken into great favour) was the head; \nand was carried on through some few years to its entire completion.  \nThere is no doubt that many of these religious establishments were \nreligious in nothing but in name, and were crammed with lazy, \nindolent, and sensual monks.  There is no doubt that they imposed \nupon the people in every possible way; that they had images moved \nby wires, which they pretended were miraculously moved by Heaven; \nthat they had among them a whole tun measure full of teeth, all \npurporting to have come out of the head of one saint, who must \nindeed have been a very extraordinary person with that enormous \nallowance of grinders; that they had bits of coal which they said \nhad fried Saint Lawrence, and bits of toe-nails which they said \nbelonged to other famous saints; penknives, and boots, and girdles, \nwhich they said belonged to others; and that all these bits of \nrubbish were called Relics, and adored by the ignorant people.  \nBut, on the other hand, there is no doubt either, that the King\'s \nofficers and men punished the good monks with the bad; did great \ninjustice; demolished many beautiful things and many valuable \nlibraries; destroyed numbers of paintings, stained glass windows, \nfine pavements, and carvings; and that the whole court were \nravenously greedy and rapacious for the division of this great \nspoil among them.  The King seems to have grown almost mad in the \nardour of this pursuit; for he declared Thomas a Becket a traitor, \nthough he had been dead so many years, and had his body dug up out \nof his grave.  He must have been as miraculous as the monks \npretended, if they had told the truth, for he was found with one \nhead on his shoulders, and they had shown another as his undoubted \nand genuine head ever since his death; it had brought them vast \nsums of money, too.  The gold and jewels on his shrine filled two \ngreat chests, and eight men tottered as they carried them away.  \nHow rich the monasteries were you may infer from the fact that, \nwhen they were all suppressed, one hundred and thirty thousand \npounds a year - in those days an immense sum - came to the Crown.\n\nThese things were not done without causing great discontent among \nthe people.  The monks had been good landlords and hospitable \nentertainers of all travellers, and had been accustomed to give \naway a great deal of corn, and fruit, and meat, and other things.  \nIn those days it was difficult to change goods into money, in \nconsequence of the roads being very few and very bad, and the \ncarts, and waggons of the worst description; and they must either \nhave given away some of the good things they possessed in enormous \nquantities, or have suffered them to spoil and moulder.  So, many \nof the people missed what it was more agreeable to get idly than to \nwork for; and the monks who were driven out of their homes and \nwandered about encouraged their discontent; and there were, \nconsequently, great risings in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.  These \nwere put down by terrific executions, from which the monks \nthemselves did not escape, and the King went on grunting and \ngrowling in his own fat way, like a Royal pig.\n\nI have told all this story of the religious houses at one time, to \nmake it plainer, and to get back to the King\'s domestic affairs.\n\nThe unfortunate Queen Catherine was by this time dead; and the King \nwas by this time as tired of his second Queen as he had been of his \nfirst.  As he had fallen in love with Anne when she was in the \nservice of Catherine, so he now fell in love with another lady in \nthe service of Anne.  See how wicked deeds are punished, and how \nbitterly and self-reproachfully the Queen must now have thought of \nher own rise to the throne!  The new fancy was a LADY JANE SEYMOUR; \nand the King no sooner set his mind on her, than he resolved to \nhave Anne Boleyn\'s head.  So, he brought a number of charges \nagainst Anne, accusing her of dreadful crimes which she had never \ncommitted, and implicating in them her own brother and certain \ngentlemen in her service:  among whom one Norris, and Mark Smeaton \na musician, are best remembered.  As the lords and councillors were \nas afraid of the King and as subservient to him as the meanest \npeasant in England was, they brought in Anne Boleyn guilty, and the \nother unfortunate persons accused with her, guilty too.  Those \ngentlemen died like men, with the exception of Smeaton, who had \nbeen tempted by the King into telling lies, which he called \nconfessions, and who had expected to be pardoned; but who, I am \nvery glad to say, was not.  There was then only the Queen to \ndispose of.  She had been surrounded in the Tower with women spies; \nhad been monstrously persecuted and foully slandered; and had \nreceived no justice.  But her spirit rose with her afflictions; \nand, after having in vain tried to soften the King by writing an \naffecting letter to him which still exists, \'from her doleful \nprison in the Tower,\' she resigned herself to death.  She said to \nthose about her, very cheerfully, that she had heard say the \nexecutioner was a good one, and that she had a little neck (she \nlaughed and clasped it with her hands as she said that), and would \nsoon be out of her pain.  And she WAS soon out of her pain, poor \ncreature, on the Green inside the Tower, and her body was flung \ninto an old box and put away in the ground under the chapel.\n\nThere is a story that the King sat in his palace listening very \nanxiously for the sound of the cannon which was to announce this \nnew murder; and that, when he heard it come booming on the air, he \nrose up in great spirits and ordered out his dogs to go a-hunting.  \nHe was bad enough to do it; but whether he did it or not, it is \ncertain that he married Jane Seymour the very next day.\n\nI have not much pleasure in recording that she lived just long \nenough to give birth to a son who was christened EDWARD, and then \nto die of a fever:  for, I cannot but think that any woman who \nmarried such a ruffian, and knew what innocent blood was on his \nhands, deserved the axe that would assuredly have fallen on the \nneck of Jane Seymour, if she had lived much longer.\n\nCranmer had done what he could to save some of the Church property \nfor purposes of religion and education; but, the great families had \nbeen so hungry to get hold of it, that very little could be rescued \nfor such objects.  Even MILES COVERDALE, who did the people the \ninestimable service of translating the Bible into English (which \nthe unreformed religion never permitted to be done), was left in \npoverty while the great families clutched the Church lands and \nmoney.  The people had been told that when the Crown came into \npossession of these funds, it would not be necessary to tax them; \nbut they were taxed afresh directly afterwards.  It was fortunate \nfor them, indeed, that so many nobles were so greedy for this \nwealth; since, if it had remained with the Crown, there might have \nbeen no end to tyranny for hundreds of years.  One of the most \nactive writers on the Church\'s side against the King was a member \nof his own family - a sort of distant cousin, REGINALD POLE by name \n- who attacked him in the most violent manner (though he received a \npension from him all the time), and fought for the Church with his \npen, day and night.  As he was beyond the King\'s reach - being in \nItaly - the King politely invited him over to discuss the subject; \nbut he, knowing better than to come, and wisely staying where he \nwas, the King\'s rage fell upon his brother Lord Montague, the \nMarquis of Exeter, and some other gentlemen:  who were tried for \nhigh treason in corresponding with him and aiding him - which they \nprobably did - and were all executed.  The Pope made Reginald Pole \na cardinal; but, so much against his will, that it is thought he \neven aspired in his own mind to the vacant throne of England, and \nhad hopes of marrying the Princess Mary.  His being made a high \npriest, however, put an end to all that.  His mother, the venerable \nCountess of Salisbury - who was, unfortunately for herself, within \nthe tyrant\'s reach - was the last of his relatives on whom his \nwrath fell.  When she was told to lay her grey head upon the block, \nshe answered the executioner, \'No!  My head never committed \ntreason, and if you want it, you shall seize it.\'  So, she ran \nround and round the scaffold with the executioner striking at her, \nand her grey hair bedabbled with blood; and even when they held her \ndown upon the block she moved her head about to the last, resolved \nto be no party to her own barbarous murder.  All this the people \nbore, as they had borne everything else.\n\nIndeed they bore much more; for the slow fires of Smithfield were \ncontinually burning, and people were constantly being roasted to \ndeath - still to show what a good Christian the King was.  He \ndefied the Pope and his Bull, which was now issued, and had come \ninto England; but he burned innumerable people whose only offence \nwas that they differed from the Pope\'s religious opinions.  There \nwas a wretched man named LAMBERT, among others, who was tried for \nthis before the King, and with whom six bishops argued one after \nanother.  When he was quite exhausted (as well he might be, after \nsix bishops), he threw himself on the King\'s mercy; but the King \nblustered out that he had no mercy for heretics.  So, HE too fed \nthe fire.\n\nAll this the people bore, and more than all this yet.  The national \nspirit seems to have been banished from the kingdom at this time.  \nThe very people who were executed for treason, the very wives and \nfriends of the \'bluff\' King, spoke of him on the scaffold as a good \nprince, and a gentle prince - just as serfs in similar \ncircumstances have been known to do, under the Sultan and Bashaws \nof the East, or under the fierce old tyrants of Russia, who poured \nboiling and freezing water on them alternately, until they died.  \nThe Parliament were as bad as the rest, and gave the King whatever \nhe wanted; among other vile accommodations, they gave him new \npowers of murdering, at his will and pleasure, any one whom he \nmight choose to call a traitor.  But the worst measure they passed \nwas an Act of Six Articles, commonly called at the time \'the whip \nwith six strings;\' which punished offences against the Pope\'s \nopinions, without mercy, and enforced the very worst parts of the \nmonkish religion.  Cranmer would have modified it, if he could; \nbut, being overborne by the Romish party, had not the power.  As \none of the articles declared that priests should not marry, and as \nhe was married himself, he sent his wife and children into Germany, \nand began to tremble at his danger; none the less because he was, \nand had long been, the King\'s friend.  This whip of six strings was \nmade under the King\'s own eye.  It should never be forgotten of him \nhow cruelly he supported the worst of the Popish doctrines when \nthere was nothing to be got by opposing them.\n\nThis amiable monarch now thought of taking another wife.  He \nproposed to the French King to have some of the ladies of the \nFrench Court exhibited before him, that he might make his Royal \nchoice; but the French King answered that he would rather not have \nhis ladies trotted out to be shown like horses at a fair.  He \nproposed to the Dowager Duchess of Milan, who replied that she \nmight have thought of such a match if she had had two heads; but, \nthat only owning one, she must beg to keep it safe.  At last \nCromwell represented that there was a Protestant Princess in \nGermany - those who held the reformed religion were called \nProtestants, because their leaders had Protested against the abuses \nand impositions of the unreformed Church - named ANNE OF CLEVES, \nwho was beautiful, and would answer the purpose admirably.  The \nKing said was she a large woman, because he must have a fat wife?  \n\'O yes,\' said Cromwell; \'she was very large, just the thing.\'  On \nhearing this the King sent over his famous painter, Hans Holbein, \nto take her portrait.  Hans made her out to be so good-looking that \nthe King was satisfied, and the marriage was arranged.  But, \nwhether anybody had paid Hans to touch up the picture; or whether \nHans, like one or two other painters, flattered a princess in the \nordinary way of business, I cannot say:  all I know is, that when \nAnne came over and the King went to Rochester to meet her, and \nfirst saw her without her seeing him, he swore she was \'a great \nFlanders mare,\' and said he would never marry her.  Being obliged \nto do it now matters had gone so far, he would not give her the \npresents he had prepared, and would never notice her.  He never \nforgave Cromwell his part in the affair.  His downfall dates from \nthat time.\n\nIt was quickened by his enemies, in the interests of the unreformed \nreligion, putting in the King\'s way, at a state dinner, a niece of \nthe Duke of Norfolk, CATHERINE HOWARD, a young lady of fascinating \nmanners, though small in stature and not particularly beautiful.  \nFalling in love with her on the spot, the King soon divorced Anne \nof Cleves after making her the subject of much brutal talk, on \npretence that she had been previously betrothed to some one else - \nwhich would never do for one of his dignity - and married \nCatherine.  It is probable that on his wedding day, of all days in \nthe year, he sent his faithful Cromwell to the scaffold, and had \nhis head struck off.  He further celebrated the occasion by burning \nat one time, and causing to be drawn to the fire on the same \nhurdles, some Protestant prisoners for denying the Pope\'s \ndoctrines, and some Roman Catholic prisoners for denying his own \nsupremacy.  Still the people bore it, and not a gentleman in \nEngland raised his hand.\n\nBut, by a just retribution, it soon came out that Catherine Howard, \nbefore her marriage, had been really guilty of such crimes as the \nKing had falsely attributed to his second wife Anne Boleyn; so, \nagain the dreadful axe made the King a widower, and this Queen \npassed away as so many in that reign had passed away before her.  \nAs an appropriate pursuit under the circumstances, Henry then \napplied himself to superintending the composition of a religious \nbook called \'A necessary doctrine for any Christian Man.\'  He must \nhave been a little confused in his mind, I think, at about this \nperiod; for he was so false to himself as to be true to some one:  \nthat some one being Cranmer, whom the Duke of Norfolk and others of \nhis enemies tried to ruin; but to whom the King was steadfast, and \nto whom he one night gave his ring, charging him when he should \nfind himself, next day, accused of treason, to show it to the \ncouncil board.  This Cranmer did to the confusion of his enemies.  \nI suppose the King thought he might want him a little longer.\n\nHe married yet once more.  Yes, strange to say, he found in England \nanother woman who would become his wife, and she was CATHERINE \nPARR, widow of Lord Latimer.  She leaned towards the reformed \nreligion; and it is some comfort to know, that she tormented the \nKing considerably by arguing a variety of doctrinal points with him \non all possible occasions.  She had very nearly done this to her \nown destruction.  After one of these conversations the King in a \nvery black mood actually instructed GARDINER, one of his Bishops \nwho favoured the Popish opinions, to draw a bill of accusation \nagainst her, which would have inevitably brought her to the \nscaffold where her predecessors had died, but that one of her \nfriends picked up the paper of instructions which had been dropped \nin the palace, and gave her timely notice.  She fell ill with \nterror; but managed the King so well when he came to entrap her \ninto further statements - by saying that she had only spoken on \nsuch points to divert his mind and to get some information from his \nextraordinary wisdom - that he gave her a kiss and called her his \nsweetheart.  And, when the Chancellor came next day actually to \ntake her to the Tower, the King sent him about his business, and \nhonoured him with the epithets of a beast, a knave, and a fool.  So \nnear was Catherine Parr to the block, and so narrow was her escape!\n\nThere was war with Scotland in this reign, and a short clumsy war \nwith France for favouring Scotland; but, the events at home were so \ndreadful, and leave such an enduring stain on the country, that I \nneed say no more of what happened abroad.\n\nA few more horrors, and this reign is over.  There was a lady, ANNE \nASKEW, in Lincolnshire, who inclined to the Protestant opinions, \nand whose husband being a fierce Catholic, turned her out of his \nhouse.  She came to London, and was considered as offending against \nthe six articles, and was taken to the Tower, and put upon the rack \n- probably because it was hoped that she might, in her agony, \ncriminate some obnoxious persons; if falsely, so much the better.  \nShe was tortured without uttering a cry, until the Lieutenant of \nthe Tower would suffer his men to torture her no more; and then two \npriests who were present actually pulled off their robes, and \nturned the wheels of the rack with their own hands, so rending and \ntwisting and breaking her that she was afterwards carried to the \nfire in a chair.  She was burned with three others, a gentleman, a \nclergyman, and a tailor; and so the world went on.\n\nEither the King became afraid of the power of the Duke of Norfolk, \nand his son the Earl of Surrey, or they gave him some offence, but \nhe resolved to pull THEM down, to follow all the rest who were \ngone.  The son was tried first - of course for nothing - and \ndefended himself bravely; but of course he was found guilty, and of \ncourse he was executed.  Then his father was laid hold of, and left \nfor death too.\n\nBut the King himself was left for death by a Greater King, and the \nearth was to be rid of him at last.  He was now a swollen, hideous \nspectacle, with a great hole in his leg, and so odious to every \nsense that it was dreadful to approach him.  When he was found to \nbe dying, Cranmer was sent for from his palace at Croydon, and came \nwith all speed, but found him speechless.  Happily, in that hour he \nperished.  He was in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and the \nthirty-eighth of his reign.\n\nHenry the Eighth has been favoured by some Protestant writers, \nbecause the Reformation was achieved in his time.  But the mighty \nmerit of it lies with other men and not with him; and it can be \nrendered none the worse by this monster\'s crimes, and none the \nbetter by any defence of them.  The plain truth is, that he was a \nmost intolerable ruffian, a disgrace to human nature, and a blot of \nblood and grease upon the History of England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SIXTH\n\n\n\nHENRY THE EIGHTH had made a will, appointing a council of sixteen \nto govern the kingdom for his son while he was under age (he was \nnow only ten years old), and another council of twelve to help \nthem.  The most powerful of the first council was the EARL OF \nHERTFORD, the young King\'s uncle, who lost no time in bringing his \nnephew with great state up to Enfield, and thence to the Tower.  It \nwas considered at the time a striking proof of virtue in the young \nKing that he was sorry for his father\'s death; but, as common \nsubjects have that virtue too, sometimes, we will say no more about \nit.\n\nThere was a curious part of the late King\'s will, requiring his \nexecutors to fulfil whatever promises he had made.  Some of the \ncourt wondering what these might be, the Earl of Hertford and the \nother noblemen interested, said that they were promises to advance \nand enrich THEM.  So, the Earl of Hertford made himself DUKE OF \nSOMERSET, and made his brother EDWARD SEYMOUR a baron; and there \nwere various similar promotions, all very agreeable to the parties \nconcerned, and very dutiful, no doubt, to the late King\'s memory.  \nTo be more dutiful still, they made themselves rich out of the \nChurch lands, and were very comfortable.  The new Duke of Somerset \ncaused himself to be declared PROTECTOR of the kingdom, and was, \nindeed, the King.\n\nAs young Edward the Sixth had been brought up in the principles of \nthe Protestant religion, everybody knew that they would be \nmaintained.  But Cranmer, to whom they were chiefly entrusted, \nadvanced them steadily and temperately.  Many superstitious and \nridiculous practices were stopped; but practices which were \nharmless were not interfered with.\n\nThe Duke of Somerset, the Protector, was anxious to have the young \nKing engaged in marriage to the young Queen of Scotland, in order \nto prevent that princess from making an alliance with any foreign \npower; but, as a large party in Scotland were unfavourable to this \nplan, he invaded that country.  His excuse for doing so was, that \nthe Border men - that is, the Scotch who lived in that part of the \ncountry where England and Scotland joined - troubled the English \nvery much.  But there were two sides to this question; for the \nEnglish Border men troubled the Scotch too; and, through many long \nyears, there were perpetual border quarrels which gave rise to \nnumbers of old tales and songs.  However, the Protector invaded \nScotland; and ARRAN, the Scottish Regent, with an army twice as \nlarge as his, advanced to meet him.  They encountered on the banks \nof the river Esk, within a few miles of Edinburgh; and there, after \na little skirmish, the Protector made such moderate proposals, in \noffering to retire if the Scotch would only engage not to marry \ntheir princess to any foreign prince, that the Regent thought the \nEnglish were afraid.  But in this he made a horrible mistake; for \nthe English soldiers on land, and the English sailors on the water, \nso set upon the Scotch, that they broke and fled, and more than ten \nthousand of them were killed.  It was a dreadful battle, for the \nfugitives were slain without mercy.  The ground for four miles, all \nthe way to Edinburgh, was strewn with dead men, and with arms, and \nlegs, and heads.  Some hid themselves in streams and were drowned; \nsome threw away their armour and were killed running, almost naked; \nbut in this battle of Pinkey the English lost only two or three \nhundred men.  They were much better clothed than the Scotch; at the \npoverty of whose appearance and country they were exceedingly \nastonished.\n\nA Parliament was called when Somerset came back, and it repealed \nthe whip with six strings, and did one or two other good things; \nthough it unhappily retained the punishment of burning for those \npeople who did not make believe to believe, in all religious \nmatters, what the Government had declared that they must and should \nbelieve.  It also made a foolish law (meant to put down beggars), \nthat any man who lived idly and loitered about for three days \ntogether, should be burned with a hot iron, made a slave, and wear \nan iron fetter.  But this savage absurdity soon came to an end, and \nwent the way of a great many other foolish laws.\n\nThe Protector was now so proud that he sat in Parliament before all \nthe nobles, on the right hand of the throne.  Many other noblemen, \nwho only wanted to be as proud if they could get a chance, became \nhis enemies of course; and it is supposed that he came back \nsuddenly from Scotland because he had received news that his \nbrother, LORD SEYMOUR, was becoming dangerous to him.  This lord \nwas now High Admiral of England; a very handsome man, and a great \nfavourite with the Court ladies - even with the young Princess \nElizabeth, who romped with him a little more than young princesses \nin these times do with any one.  He had married Catherine Parr, the \nlate King\'s widow, who was now dead; and, to strengthen his power, \nhe secretly supplied the young King with money.  He may even have \nengaged with some of his brother\'s enemies in a plot to carry the \nboy off.  On these and other accusations, at any rate, he was \nconfined in the Tower, impeached, and found guilty; his own \nbrother\'s name being - unnatural and sad to tell - the first signed \nto the warrant of his execution.  He was executed on Tower Hill, \nand died denying his treason.  One of his last proceedings in this \nworld was to write two letters, one to the Princess Elizabeth, and \none to the Princess Mary, which a servant of his took charge of, \nand concealed in his shoe.  These letters are supposed to have \nurged them against his brother, and to revenge his death.  What \nthey truly contained is not known; but there is no doubt that he \nhad, at one time, obtained great influence over the Princess \nElizabeth.\n\nAll this while, the Protestant religion was making progress.  The \nimages which the people had gradually come to worship, were removed \nfrom the churches; the people were informed that they need not \nconfess themselves to priests unless they chose; a common prayer-\nbook was drawn up in the English language, which all could \nunderstand, and many other improvements were made; still \nmoderately.  For Cranmer was a very moderate man, and even \nrestrained the Protestant clergy from violently abusing the \nunreformed religion - as they very often did, and which was not a \ngood example.  But the people were at this time in great distress.  \nThe rapacious nobility who had come into possession of the Church \nlands, were very bad landlords.  They enclosed great quantities of \nground for the feeding of sheep, which was then more profitable \nthan the growing of crops; and this increased the general distress.  \nSo the people, who still understood little of what was going on \nabout them, and still readily believed what the homeless monks told \nthem - many of whom had been their good friends in their better \ndays - took it into their heads that all this was owing to the \nreformed religion, and therefore rose, in many parts of the \ncountry.\n\nThe most powerful risings were in Devonshire and Norfolk.  In \nDevonshire, the rebellion was so strong that ten thousand men \nunited within a few days, and even laid siege to Exeter.  But LORD \nRUSSELL, coming to the assistance of the citizens who defended that \ntown, defeated the rebels; and, not only hanged the Mayor of one \nplace, but hanged the vicar of another from his own church steeple.  \nWhat with hanging and killing by the sword, four thousand of the \nrebels are supposed to have fallen in that one county.  In Norfolk \n(where the rising was more against the enclosure of open lands than \nagainst the reformed religion), the popular leader was a man named \nROBERT KET, a tanner of Wymondham.  The mob were, in the first \ninstance, excited against the tanner by one JOHN FLOWERDEW, a \ngentleman who owed him a grudge:  but the tanner was more than a \nmatch for the gentleman, since he soon got the people on his side, \nand established himself near Norwich with quite an army.  There was \na large oak-tree in that place, on a spot called Moushold Hill, \nwhich Ket named the Tree of Reformation; and under its green \nboughs, he and his men sat, in the midsummer weather, holding \ncourts of justice, and debating affairs of state.  They were even \nimpartial enough to allow some rather tiresome public speakers to \nget up into this Tree of Reformation, and point out their errors to \nthem, in long discourses, while they lay listening (not always \nwithout some grumbling and growling) in the shade below.  At last, \none sunny July day, a herald appeared below the tree, and \nproclaimed Ket and all his men traitors, unless from that moment \nthey dispersed and went home:  in which case they were to receive a \npardon.  But, Ket and his men made light of the herald and became \nstronger than ever, until the Earl of Warwick went after them with \na sufficient force, and cut them all to pieces.  A few were hanged, \ndrawn, and quartered, as traitors, and their limbs were sent into \nvarious country places to be a terror to the people.  Nine of them \nwere hanged upon nine green branches of the Oak of Reformation; and \nso, for the time, that tree may be said to have withered away.\n\nThe Protector, though a haughty man, had compassion for the real \ndistresses of the common people, and a sincere desire to help them.  \nBut he was too proud and too high in degree to hold even their \nfavour steadily; and many of the nobles always envied and hated \nhim, because they were as proud and not as high as he.  He was at \nthis time building a great Palace in the Strand:  to get the stone \nfor which he blew up church steeples with gunpowder, and pulled \ndown bishops\' houses:  thus making himself still more disliked.  At \nlength, his principal enemy, the Earl of Warwick - Dudley by name, \nand the son of that Dudley who had made himself so odious with \nEmpson, in the reign of Henry the Seventh - joined with seven other \nmembers of the Council against him, formed a separate Council; and, \nbecoming stronger in a few days, sent him to the Tower under \ntwenty-nine articles of accusation.  After being sentenced by the \nCouncil to the forfeiture of all his offices and lands, he was \nliberated and pardoned, on making a very humble submission.  He was \neven taken back into the Council again, after having suffered this \nfall, and married his daughter, LADY ANNE SEYMOUR, to Warwick\'s \neldest son.  But such a reconciliation was little likely to last, \nand did not outlive a year.  Warwick, having got himself made Duke \nof Northumberland, and having advanced the more important of his \nfriends, then finished the history by causing the Duke of Somerset \nand his friend LORD GREY, and others, to be arrested for treason, \nin having conspired to seize and dethrone the King.  They were also \naccused of having intended to seize the new Duke of Northumberland, \nwith his friends LORD NORTHAMPTON and LORD PEMBROKE; to murder them \nif they found need; and to raise the City to revolt.  All this the \nfallen Protector positively denied; except that he confessed to \nhaving spoken of the murder of those three noblemen, but having \nnever designed it.  He was acquitted of the charge of treason, and \nfound guilty of the other charges; so when the people - who \nremembered his having been their friend, now that he was disgraced \nand in danger, saw him come out from his trial with the axe turned \nfrom him - they thought he was altogether acquitted, and sent up a \nloud shout of joy.\n\nBut the Duke of Somerset was ordered to be beheaded on Tower Hill, \nat eight o\'clock in the morning, and proclamations were issued \nbidding the citizens keep at home until after ten.  They filled the \nstreets, however, and crowded the place of execution as soon as it \nwas light; and, with sad faces and sad hearts, saw the once \npowerful Protector ascend the scaffold to lay his head upon the \ndreadful block.  While he was yet saying his last words to them \nwith manly courage, and telling them, in particular, how it \ncomforted him, at that pass, to have assisted in reforming the \nnational religion, a member of the Council was seen riding up on \nhorseback.  They again thought that the Duke was saved by his \nbringing a reprieve, and again shouted for joy.  But the Duke \nhimself told them they were mistaken, and laid down his head and \nhad it struck off at a blow.\n\nMany of the bystanders rushed forward and steeped their \nhandkerchiefs in his blood, as a mark of their affection.  He had, \nindeed, been capable of many good acts, and one of them was \ndiscovered after he was no more.  The Bishop of Durham, a very good \nman, had been informed against to the Council, when the Duke was in \npower, as having answered a treacherous letter proposing a \nrebellion against the reformed religion.  As the answer could not \nbe found, he could not be declared guilty; but it was now \ndiscovered, hidden by the Duke himself among some private papers, \nin his regard for that good man.  The Bishop lost his office, and \nwas deprived of his possessions.\n\nIt is not very pleasant to know that while his uncle lay in prison \nunder sentence of death, the young King was being vastly \nentertained by plays, and dances, and sham fights:  but there is no \ndoubt of it, for he kept a journal himself.  It is pleasanter to \nknow that not a single Roman Catholic was burnt in this reign for \nholding that religion; though two wretched victims suffered for \nheresy.  One, a woman named JOAN BOCHER, for professing some \nopinions that even she could only explain in unintelligible jargon.  \nThe other, a Dutchman, named VON PARIS, who practised as a surgeon \nin London.  Edward was, to his credit, exceedingly unwilling to \nsign the warrant for the woman\'s execution:  shedding tears before \nhe did so, and telling Cranmer, who urged him to do it (though \nCranmer really would have spared the woman at first, but for her \nown determined obstinacy), that the guilt was not his, but that of \nthe man who so strongly urged the dreadful act.  We shall see, too \nsoon, whether the time ever came when Cranmer is likely to have \nremembered this with sorrow and remorse.\n\nCranmer and RIDLEY (at first Bishop of Rochester, and afterwards \nBishop of London) were the most powerful of the clergy of this \nreign.  Others were imprisoned and deprived of their property for \nstill adhering to the unreformed religion; the most important among \nwhom were GARDINER Bishop of Winchester, HEATH Bishop of Worcester, \nDAY Bishop of Chichester, and BONNER that Bishop of London who was \nsuperseded by Ridley.  The Princess Mary, who inherited her \nmother\'s gloomy temper, and hated the reformed religion as \nconnected with her mother\'s wrongs and sorrows - she knew nothing \nelse about it, always refusing to read a single book in which it \nwas truly described - held by the unreformed religion too, and was \nthe only person in the kingdom for whom the old Mass was allowed to \nbe performed; nor would the young King have made that exception \neven in her favour, but for the strong persuasions of Cranmer and \nRidley.  He always viewed it with horror; and when he fell into a \nsickly condition, after having been very ill, first of the measles \nand then of the small-pox, he was greatly troubled in mind to think \nthat if he died, and she, the next heir to the throne, succeeded, \nthe Roman Catholic religion would be set up again.\n\nThis uneasiness, the Duke of Northumberland was not slow to \nencourage:  for, if the Princess Mary came to the throne, he, who \nhad taken part with the Protestants, was sure to be disgraced.  \nNow, the Duchess of Suffolk was descended from King Henry the \nSeventh; and, if she resigned what little or no right she had, in \nfavour of her daughter LADY JANE GREY, that would be the succession \nto promote the Duke\'s greatness; because LORD GUILFORD DUDLEY, one \nof his sons, was, at this very time, newly married to her.  So, he \nworked upon the King\'s fears, and persuaded him to set aside both \nthe Princess Mary and the Princess Elizabeth, and assert his right \nto appoint his successor.  Accordingly the young King handed to the \nCrown lawyers a writing signed half a dozen times over by himself, \nappointing Lady Jane Grey to succeed to the Crown, and requiring \nthem to have his will made out according to law.  They were much \nagainst it at first, and told the King so; but the Duke of \nNorthumberland - being so violent about it that the lawyers even \nexpected him to beat them, and hotly declaring that, stripped to \nhis shirt, he would fight any man in such a quarrel - they yielded.  \nCranmer, also, at first hesitated; pleading that he had sworn to \nmaintain the succession of the Crown to the Princess Mary; but, he \nwas a weak man in his resolutions, and afterwards signed the \ndocument with the rest of the council.\n\nIt was completed none too soon; for Edward was now sinking in a \nrapid decline; and, by way of making him better, they handed him \nover to a woman-doctor who pretended to be able to cure it.  He \nspeedily got worse.  On the sixth of July, in the year one thousand \nfive hundred and fifty-three, he died, very peaceably and piously, \npraying God, with his last breath, to protect the reformed \nreligion.\n\nThis King died in the sixteenth year of his age, and in the seventh \nof his reign.  It is difficult to judge what the character of one \nso young might afterwards have become among so many bad, ambitious, \nquarrelling nobles.  But, he was an amiable boy, of very good \nabilities, and had nothing coarse or cruel or brutal in his \ndisposition - which in the son of such a father is rather \nsurprising.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX - ENGLAND UNDER MARY\n\n\n\nTHE Duke of Northumberland was very anxious to keep the young \nKing\'s death a secret, in order that he might get the two \nPrincesses into his power.  But, the Princess Mary, being informed \nof that event as she was on her way to London to see her sick \nbrother, turned her horse\'s head, and rode away into Norfolk.  The \nEarl of Arundel was her friend, and it was he who sent her warning \nof what had happened.\n\nAs the secret could not be kept, the Duke of Northumberland and the \ncouncil sent for the Lord Mayor of London and some of the aldermen, \nand made a merit of telling it to them.  Then, they made it known \nto the people, and set off to inform Lady Jane Grey that she was to \nbe Queen.\n\nShe was a pretty girl of only sixteen, and was amiable, learned, \nand clever.  When the lords who came to her, fell on their knees \nbefore her, and told her what tidings they brought, she was so \nastonished that she fainted.  On recovering, she expressed her \nsorrow for the young King\'s death, and said that she knew she was \nunfit to govern the kingdom; but that if she must be Queen, she \nprayed God to direct her.  She was then at Sion House, near \nBrentford; and the lords took her down the river in state to the \nTower, that she might remain there (as the custom was) until she \nwas crowned.  But the people were not at all favourable to Lady \nJane, considering that the right to be Queen was Mary\'s, and \ngreatly disliking the Duke of Northumberland.  They were not put \ninto a better humour by the Duke\'s causing a vintner\'s servant, one \nGabriel Pot, to be taken up for expressing his dissatisfaction \namong the crowd, and to have his ears nailed to the pillory, and \ncut off.  Some powerful men among the nobility declared on Mary\'s \nside.  They raised troops to support her cause, had her proclaimed \nQueen at Norwich, and gathered around her at the castle of \nFramlingham, which belonged to the Duke of Norfolk.  For, she was \nnot considered so safe as yet, but that it was best to keep her in \na castle on the sea-coast, from whence she might be sent abroad, if \nnecessary.\n\nThe Council would have despatched Lady Jane\'s father, the Duke of \nSuffolk, as the general of the army against this force; but, as \nLady Jane implored that her father might remain with her, and as he \nwas known to be but a weak man, they told the Duke of \nNorthumberland that he must take the command himself.  He was not \nvery ready to do so, as he mistrusted the Council much; but there \nwas no help for it, and he set forth with a heavy heart, observing \nto a lord who rode beside him through Shoreditch at the head of the \ntroops, that, although the people pressed in great numbers to look \nat them, they were terribly silent.\n\nAnd his fears for himself turned out to be well founded.  While he \nwas waiting at Cambridge for further help from the Council, the \nCouncil took it into their heads to turn their backs on Lady Jane\'s \ncause, and to take up the Princess Mary\'s.  This was chiefly owing \nto the before-mentioned Earl of Arundel, who represented to the \nLord Mayor and aldermen, in a second interview with those sagacious \npersons, that, as for himself, he did not perceive the Reformed \nreligion to be in much danger - which Lord Pembroke backed by \nflourishing his sword as another kind of persuasion.  The Lord \nMayor and aldermen, thus enlightened, said there could be no doubt \nthat the Princess Mary ought to be Queen.  So, she was proclaimed \nat the Cross by St. Paul\'s, and barrels of wine were given to the \npeople, and they got very drunk, and danced round blazing bonfires \n- little thinking, poor wretches, what other bonfires would soon be \nblazing in Queen Mary\'s name.\n\nAfter a ten days\' dream of royalty, Lady Jane Grey resigned the \nCrown with great willingness, saying that she had only accepted it \nin obedience to her father and mother; and went gladly back to her \npleasant house by the river, and her books.  Mary then came on \ntowards London; and at Wanstead in Essex, was joined by her half-\nsister, the Princess Elizabeth.  They passed through the streets of \nLondon to the Tower, and there the new Queen met some eminent \nprisoners then confined in it, kissed them, and gave them their \nliberty.  Among these was that Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, who \nhad been imprisoned in the last reign for holding to the unreformed \nreligion.  Him she soon made chancellor.\n\nThe Duke of Northumberland had been taken prisoner, and, together \nwith his son and five others, was quickly brought before the \nCouncil.  He, not unnaturally, asked that Council, in his defence, \nwhether it was treason to obey orders that had been issued under \nthe great seal; and, if it were, whether they, who had obeyed them \ntoo, ought to be his judges?  But they made light of these points; \nand, being resolved to have him out of the way, soon sentenced him \nto death.  He had risen into power upon the death of another man, \nand made but a poor show (as might be expected) when he himself lay \nlow.  He entreated Gardiner to let him live, if it were only in a \nmouse\'s hole; and, when he ascended the scaffold to be beheaded on \nTower Hill, addressed the people in a miserable way, saying that he \nhad been incited by others, and exhorting them to return to the \nunreformed religion, which he told them was his faith.  There seems \nreason to suppose that he expected a pardon even then, in return \nfor this confession; but it matters little whether he did or not.  \nHis head was struck off.\n\nMary was now crowned Queen.  She was thirty-seven years of age, \nshort and thin, wrinkled in the face, and very unhealthy.  But she \nhad a great liking for show and for bright colours, and all the \nladies of her Court were magnificently dressed.  She had a great \nliking too for old customs, without much sense in them; and she was \noiled in the oldest way, and blessed in the oldest way, and done \nall manner of things to in the oldest way, at her coronation.  I \nhope they did her good.\n\nShe soon began to show her desire to put down the Reformed \nreligion, and put up the unreformed one:  though it was dangerous \nwork as yet, the people being something wiser than they used to be.  \nThey even cast a shower of stones - and among them a dagger - at \none of the royal chaplains who attacked the Reformed religion in a \npublic sermon.  But the Queen and her priests went steadily on.  \nRidley, the powerful bishop of the last reign, was seized and sent \nto the Tower.  LATIMER, also celebrated among the Clergy of the \nlast reign, was likewise sent to the Tower, and Cranmer speedily \nfollowed.  Latimer was an aged man; and, as his guards took him \nthrough Smithfield, he looked round it, and said, \'This is a place \nthat hath long groaned for me.\'  For he knew well, what kind of \nbonfires would soon be burning.  Nor was the knowledge confined to \nhim.  The prisons were fast filled with the chief Protestants, who \nwere there left rotting in darkness, hunger, dirt, and separation \nfrom their friends; many, who had time left them for escape, fled \nfrom the kingdom; and the dullest of the people began, now, to see \nwhat was coming.\n\nIt came on fast.  A Parliament was got together; not without strong \nsuspicion of unfairness; and they annulled the divorce, formerly \npronounced by Cranmer between the Queen\'s mother and King Henry the \nEighth, and unmade all the laws on the subject of religion that had \nbeen made in the last King Edward\'s reign.  They began their \nproceedings, in violation of the law, by having the old mass said \nbefore them in Latin, and by turning out a bishop who would not \nkneel down.  They also declared guilty of treason, Lady Jane Grey \nfor aspiring to the Crown; her husband, for being her husband; and \nCranmer, for not believing in the mass aforesaid.  They then prayed \nthe Queen graciously to choose a husband for herself, as soon as \nmight be.\n\nNow, the question who should be the Queen\'s husband had given rise \nto a great deal of discussion, and to several contending parties.  \nSome said Cardinal Pole was the man - but the Queen was of opinion \nthat he was NOT the man, he being too old and too much of a \nstudent.  Others said that the gallant young COURTENAY, whom the \nQueen had made Earl of Devonshire, was the man - and the Queen \nthought so too, for a while; but she changed her mind.  At last it \nappeared that PHILIP, PRINCE OF SPAIN, was certainly the man - \nthough certainly not the people\'s man; for they detested the idea \nof such a marriage from the beginning to the end, and murmured that \nthe Spaniard would establish in England, by the aid of foreign \nsoldiers, the worst abuses of the Popish religion, and even the \nterrible Inquisition itself.\n\nThese discontents gave rise to a conspiracy for marrying young \nCourtenay to the Princess Elizabeth, and setting them up, with \npopular tumults all over the kingdom, against the Queen.  This was \ndiscovered in time by Gardiner; but in Kent, the old bold county, \nthe people rose in their old bold way.  SIR THOMAS WYAT, a man of \ngreat daring, was their leader.  He raised his standard at \nMaidstone, marched on to Rochester, established himself in the old \ncastle there, and prepared to hold out against the Duke of Norfolk, \nwho came against him with a party of the Queen\'s guards, and a body \nof five hundred London men.  The London men, however, were all for \nElizabeth, and not at all for Mary.  They declared, under the \ncastle walls, for Wyat; the Duke retreated; and Wyat came on to \nDeptford, at the head of fifteen thousand men.\n\nBut these, in their turn, fell away.  When he came to Southwark, \nthere were only two thousand left.  Not dismayed by finding the \nLondon citizens in arms, and the guns at the Tower ready to oppose \nhis crossing the river there, Wyat led them off to Kingston-upon-\nThames, intending to cross the bridge that he knew to be in that \nplace, and so to work his way round to Ludgate, one of the old \ngates of the City.  He found the bridge broken down, but mended it, \ncame across, and bravely fought his way up Fleet Street to Ludgate \nHill.  Finding the gate closed against him, he fought his way back \nagain, sword in hand, to Temple Bar.  Here, being overpowered, he \nsurrendered himself, and three or four hundred of his men were \ntaken, besides a hundred killed.  Wyat, in a moment of weakness \n(and perhaps of torture) was afterwards made to accuse the Princess \nElizabeth as his accomplice to some very small extent.  But his \nmanhood soon returned to him, and he refused to save his life by \nmaking any more false confessions.  He was quartered and \ndistributed in the usual brutal way, and from fifty to a hundred of \nhis followers were hanged.  The rest were led out, with halters \nround their necks, to be pardoned, and to make a parade of crying \nout, \'God save Queen Mary!\'\n\nIn the danger of this rebellion, the Queen showed herself to be a \nwoman of courage and spirit.  She disdained to retreat to any place \nof safety, and went down to the Guildhall, sceptre in hand, and \nmade a gallant speech to the Lord Mayor and citizens.  But on the \nday after Wyat\'s defeat, she did the most cruel act, even of her \ncruel reign, in signing the warrant for the execution of Lady Jane \nGrey.\n\nThey tried to persuade Lady Jane to accept the unreformed religion; \nbut she steadily refused.  On the morning when she was to die, she \nsaw from her window the bleeding and headless body of her husband \nbrought back in a cart from the scaffold on Tower Hill where he had \nlaid down his life.  But, as she had declined to see him before his \nexecution, lest she should be overpowered and not make a good end, \nso, she even now showed a constancy and calmness that will never be \nforgotten.  She came up to the scaffold with a firm step and a \nquiet face, and addressed the bystanders in a steady voice.  They \nwere not numerous; for she was too young, too innocent and fair, to \nbe murdered before the people on Tower Hill, as her husband had \njust been; so, the place of her execution was within the Tower \nitself.  She said that she had done an unlawful act in taking what \nwas Queen Mary\'s right; but that she had done so with no bad \nintent, and that she died a humble Christian.  She begged the \nexecutioner to despatch her quickly, and she asked him, \'Will you \ntake my head off before I lay me down?\'  He answered, \'No, Madam,\' \nand then she was very quiet while they bandaged her eyes.  Being \nblinded, and unable to see the block on which she was to lay her \nyoung head, she was seen to feel about for it with her hands, and \nwas heard to say, confused, \'O what shall I do!  Where is it?\'  \nThen they guided her to the right place, and the executioner struck \noff her head.  You know too well, now, what dreadful deeds the \nexecutioner did in England, through many, many years, and how his \naxe descended on the hateful block through the necks of some of the \nbravest, wisest, and best in the land.  But it never struck so \ncruel and so vile a blow as this.\n\nThe father of Lady Jane soon followed, but was little pitied.  \nQueen Mary\'s next object was to lay hold of Elizabeth, and this was \npursued with great eagerness.  Five hundred men were sent to her \nretired house at Ashridge, by Berkhampstead, with orders to bring \nher up, alive or dead.  They got there at ten at night, when she \nwas sick in bed.  But, their leaders followed her lady into her \nbedchamber, whence she was brought out betimes next morning, and \nput into a litter to be conveyed to London.  She was so weak and \nill, that she was five days on the road; still, she was so resolved \nto be seen by the people that she had the curtains of the litter \nopened; and so, very pale and sickly, passed through the streets.  \nShe wrote to her sister, saying she was innocent of any crime, and \nasking why she was made a prisoner; but she got no answer, and was \nordered to the Tower.  They took her in by the Traitor\'s Gate, to \nwhich she objected, but in vain.  One of the lords who conveyed her \noffered to cover her with his cloak, as it was raining, but she put \nit away from her, proudly and scornfully, and passed into the \nTower, and sat down in a court-yard on a stone.  They besought her \nto come in out of the wet; but she answered that it was better \nsitting there, than in a worse place.  At length she went to her \napartment, where she was kept a prisoner, though not so close a \nprisoner as at Woodstock, whither she was afterwards removed, and \nwhere she is said to have one day envied a milkmaid whom she heard \nsinging in the sunshine as she went through the green fields.  \nGardiner, than whom there were not many worse men among the fierce \nand sullen priests, cared little to keep secret his stern desire \nfor her death:  being used to say that it was of little service to \nshake off the leaves, and lop the branches of the tree of heresy, \nif its root, the hope of heretics, were left.  He failed, however, \nin his benevolent design.  Elizabeth was, at length, released; and \nHatfield House was assigned to her as a residence, under the care \nof one SIR THOMAS POPE.\n\nIt would seem that Philip, the Prince of Spain, was a main cause of \nthis change in Elizabeth\'s fortunes.  He was not an amiable man, \nbeing, on the contrary, proud, overbearing, and gloomy; but he and \nthe Spanish lords who came over with him, assuredly did \ndiscountenance the idea of doing any violence to the Princess.  It \nmay have been mere prudence, but we will hope it was manhood and \nhonour.  The Queen had been expecting her husband with great \nimpatience, and at length he came, to her great joy, though he \nnever cared much for her.  They were married by Gardiner, at \nWinchester, and there was more holiday-making among the people; but \nthey had their old distrust of this Spanish marriage, in which even \nthe Parliament shared.  Though the members of that Parliament were \nfar from honest, and were strongly suspected to have been bought \nwith Spanish money, they would pass no bill to enable the Queen to \nset aside the Princess Elizabeth and appoint her own successor.\n\nAlthough Gardiner failed in this object, as well as in the darker \none of bringing the Princess to the scaffold, he went on at a great \npace in the revival of the unreformed religion.  A new Parliament \nwas packed, in which there were no Protestants.  Preparations were \nmade to receive Cardinal Pole in England as the Pope\'s messenger, \nbringing his holy declaration that all the nobility who had \nacquired Church property, should keep it - which was done to enlist \ntheir selfish interest on the Pope\'s side.  Then a great scene was \nenacted, which was the triumph of the Queen\'s plans.  Cardinal Pole \narrived in great splendour and dignity, and was received with great \npomp.  The Parliament joined in a petition expressive of their \nsorrow at the change in the national religion, and praying him to \nreceive the country again into the Popish Church.  With the Queen \nsitting on her throne, and the King on one side of her, and the \nCardinal on the other, and the Parliament present, Gardiner read \nthe petition aloud.  The Cardinal then made a great speech, and was \nso obliging as to say that all was forgotten and forgiven, and that \nthe kingdom was solemnly made Roman Catholic again.\n\nEverything was now ready for the lighting of the terrible bonfires.  \nThe Queen having declared to the Council, in writing, that she \nwould wish none of her subjects to be burnt without some of the \nCouncil being present, and that she would particularly wish there \nto be good sermons at all burnings, the Council knew pretty well \nwhat was to be done next.  So, after the Cardinal had blessed all \nthe bishops as a preface to the burnings, the Chancellor Gardiner \nopened a High Court at Saint Mary Overy, on the Southwark side of \nLondon Bridge, for the trial of heretics.  Here, two of the late \nProtestant clergymen, HOOPER, Bishop of Gloucester, and ROGERS, a \nPrebendary of St. Paul\'s, were brought to be tried.  Hooper was \ntried first for being married, though a priest, and for not \nbelieving in the mass.  He admitted both of these accusations, and \nsaid that the mass was a wicked imposition.  Then they tried \nRogers, who said the same.  Next morning the two were brought up to \nbe sentenced; and then Rogers said that his poor wife, being a \nGerman woman and a stranger in the land, he hoped might be allowed \nto come to speak to him before he died.  To this the inhuman \nGardiner replied, that she was not his wife.  \'Yea, but she is, my \nlord,\' said Rogers, \'and she hath been my wife these eighteen \nyears.\'  His request was still refused, and they were both sent to \nNewgate; all those who stood in the streets to sell things, being \nordered to put out their lights that the people might not see them.  \nBut, the people stood at their doors with candles in their hands, \nand prayed for them as they went by.  Soon afterwards, Rogers was \ntaken out of jail to be burnt in Smithfield; and, in the crowd as \nhe went along, he saw his poor wife and his ten children, of whom \nthe youngest was a little baby.  And so he was burnt to death.\n\nThe next day, Hooper, who was to be burnt at Gloucester, was \nbrought out to take his last journey, and was made to wear a hood \nover his face that he might not be known by the people.  But, they \ndid know him for all that, down in his own part of the country; \nand, when he came near Gloucester, they lined the road, making \nprayers and lamentations.  His guards took him to a lodging, where \nhe slept soundly all night.  At nine o\'clock next morning, he was \nbrought forth leaning on a staff; for he had taken cold in prison, \nand was infirm.  The iron stake, and the iron chain which was to \nbind him to it, were fixed up near a great elm-tree in a pleasant \nopen place before the cathedral, where, on peaceful Sundays, he had \nbeen accustomed to preach and to pray, when he was bishop of \nGloucester.  This tree, which had no leaves then, it being \nFebruary, was filled with people; and the priests of Gloucester \nCollege were looking complacently on from a window, and there was a \ngreat concourse of spectators in every spot from which a glimpse of \nthe dreadful sight could be beheld.  When the old man kneeled down \non the small platform at the foot of the stake, and prayed aloud, \nthe nearest people were observed to be so attentive to his prayers \nthat they were ordered to stand farther back; for it did not suit \nthe Romish Church to have those Protestant words heard.  His \nprayers concluded, he went up to the stake and was stripped to his \nshirt, and chained ready for the fire.  One of his guards had such \ncompassion on him that, to shorten his agonies, he tied some \npackets of gunpowder about him.  Then they heaped up wood and straw \nand reeds, and set them all alight.  But, unhappily, the wood was \ngreen and damp, and there was a wind blowing that blew what flame \nthere was, away.  Thus, through three-quarters of an hour, the good \nold man was scorched and roasted and smoked, as the fire rose and \nsank; and all that time they saw him, as he burned, moving his lips \nin prayer, and beating his breast with one hand, even after the \nother was burnt away and had fallen off.\n\nCranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, were taken to Oxford to dispute with \na commission of priests and doctors about the mass.  They were \nshamefully treated; and it is recorded that the Oxford scholars \nhissed and howled and groaned, and misconducted themselves in an \nanything but a scholarly way.  The prisoners were taken back to \njail, and afterwards tried in St. Mary\'s Church.  They were all \nfound guilty.  On the sixteenth of the month of October, Ridley and \nLatimer were brought out, to make another of the dreadful bonfires.\n\nThe scene of the suffering of these two good Protestant men was in \nthe City ditch, near Baliol College.  On coming to the dreadful \nspot, they kissed the stakes, and then embraced each other.  And \nthen a learned doctor got up into a pulpit which was placed there, \nand preached a sermon from the text, \'Though I give my body to be \nburned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\'  When you \nthink of the charity of burning men alive, you may imagine that \nthis learned doctor had a rather brazen face.  Ridley would have \nanswered his sermon when it came to an end, but was not allowed.  \nWhen Latimer was stripped, it appeared that he had dressed himself \nunder his other clothes, in a new shroud; and, as he stood in it \nbefore all the people, it was noted of him, and long remembered, \nthat, whereas he had been stooping and feeble but a few minutes \nbefore, he now stood upright and handsome, in the knowledge that he \nwas dying for a just and a great cause.  Ridley\'s brother-in-law \nwas there with bags of gunpowder; and when they were both chained \nup, he tied them round their bodies.  Then, a light was thrown upon \nthe pile to fire it.  \'Be of good comfort, Master Ridley,\' said \nLatimer, at that awful moment, \'and play the man!  We shall this \nday light such a candle, by God\'s grace, in England, as I trust \nshall never be put out.\'  And then he was seen to make motions with \nhis hands as if he were washing them in the flames, and to stroke \nhis aged face with them, and was heard to cry, \'Father of Heaven, \nreceive my soul!\'  He died quickly, but the fire, after having \nburned the legs of Ridley, sunk.  There he lingered, chained to the \niron post, and crying, \'O!  I cannot burn!  O! for Christ\'s sake \nlet the fire come unto me!\'  And still, when his brother-in-law had \nheaped on more wood, he was heard through the blinding smoke, still \ndismally crying, \'O!  I cannot burn, I cannot burn!\'  At last, the \ngunpowder caught fire, and ended his miseries.\n\nFive days after this fearful scene, Gardiner went to his tremendous \naccount before God, for the cruelties he had so much assisted in \ncommitting.\n\nCranmer remained still alive and in prison.  He was brought out \nagain in February, for more examining and trying, by Bonner, Bishop \nof London:  another man of blood, who had succeeded to Gardiner\'s \nwork, even in his lifetime, when Gardiner was tired of it.  Cranmer \nwas now degraded as a priest, and left for death; but, if the Queen \nhated any one on earth, she hated him, and it was resolved that he \nshould be ruined and disgraced to the utmost.  There is no doubt \nthat the Queen and her husband personally urged on these deeds, \nbecause they wrote to the Council, urging them to be active in the \nkindling of the fearful fires.  As Cranmer was known not to be a \nfirm man, a plan was laid for surrounding him with artful people, \nand inducing him to recant to the unreformed religion.  Deans and \nfriars visited him, played at bowls with him, showed him various \nattentions, talked persuasively with him, gave him money for his \nprison comforts, and induced him to sign, I fear, as many as six \nrecantations.  But when, after all, he was taken out to be burnt, \nhe was nobly true to his better self, and made a glorious end.\n\nAfter prayers and a sermon, Dr. Cole, the preacher of the day (who \nhad been one of the artful priests about Cranmer in prison), \nrequired him to make a public confession of his faith before the \npeople.  This, Cole did, expecting that he would declare himself a \nRoman Catholic.  \'I will make a profession of my faith,\' said \nCranmer, \'and with a good will too.\'\n\nThen, he arose before them all, and took from the sleeve of his \nrobe a written prayer and read it aloud.  That done, he kneeled and \nsaid the Lord\'s Prayer, all the people joining; and then he arose \nagain and told them that he believed in the Bible, and that in what \nhe had lately written, he had written what was not the truth, and \nthat, because his right hand had signed those papers, he would burn \nhis right hand first when he came to the fire.  As for the Pope, he \ndid refuse him and denounce him as the enemy of Heaven.  Hereupon \nthe pious Dr. Cole cried out to the guards to stop that heretic\'s \nmouth and take him away.\n\nSo they took him away, and chained him to the stake, where he \nhastily took off his own clothes to make ready for the flames.  And \nhe stood before the people with a bald head and a white and flowing \nbeard.  He was so firm now when the worst was come, that he again \ndeclared against his recantation, and was so impressive and so \nundismayed, that a certain lord, who was one of the directors of \nthe execution, called out to the men to make haste!  When the fire \nwas lighted, Cranmer, true to his latest word, stretched out his \nright hand, and crying out, \'This hand hath offended!\' held it \namong the flames, until it blazed and burned away.  His heart was \nfound entire among his ashes, and he left at last a memorable name \nin English history.  Cardinal Pole celebrated the day by saying his \nfirst mass, and next day he was made Archbishop of Canterbury in \nCranmer\'s place.\n\nThe Queen\'s husband, who was now mostly abroad in his own \ndominions, and generally made a coarse jest of her to his more \nfamiliar courtiers, was at war with France, and came over to seek \nthe assistance of England.  England was very unwilling to engage in \na French war for his sake; but it happened that the King of France, \nat this very time, aided a descent upon the English coast.  Hence, \nwar was declared, greatly to Philip\'s satisfaction; and the Queen \nraised a sum of money with which to carry it on, by every \nunjustifiable means in her power.  It met with no profitable \nreturn, for the French Duke of Guise surprised Calais, and the \nEnglish sustained a complete defeat.  The losses they met with in \nFrance greatly mortified the national pride, and the Queen never \nrecovered the blow.\n\nThere was a bad fever raging in England at this time, and I am glad \nto write that the Queen took it, and the hour of her death came.  \n\'When I am dead and my body is opened,\' she said to those around \nthose around her, \'ye shall find CALAIS written on my heart.\'  I \nshould have thought, if anything were written on it, they would \nhave found the words - JANE GREY, HOOPER, ROGERS, RIDLEY, LATIMER, \nCRANMER, AND THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE BURNT ALIVE WITHIN FOUR YEARS OF \nMY WICKED REIGN, INCLUDING SIXTY WOMEN AND FORTY LITTLE CHILDREN.  \nBut it is enough that their deaths were written in Heaven.\n\nThe Queen died on the seventeenth of November, fifteen hundred and \nfifty-eight, after reigning not quite five years and a half, and in \nthe forty-fourth year of her age.  Cardinal Pole died of the same \nfever next day.\n\nAs BLOODY QUEEN MARY, this woman has become famous, and as BLOODY \nQUEEN MARY, she will ever be justly remembered with horror and \ndetestation in Great Britain.  Her memory has been held in such \nabhorrence that some writers have arisen in later years to take her \npart, and to show that she was, upon the whole, quite an amiable \nand cheerful sovereign!  \'By their fruits ye shall know them,\' said \nOUR SAVIOUR.  The stake and the fire were the fruits of this reign, \nand you will judge this Queen by nothing else.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI - ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH\n\n\n\nTHERE was great rejoicing all over the land when the Lords of the \nCouncil went down to Hatfield, to hail the Princess Elizabeth as \nthe new Queen of England.  Weary of the barbarities of Mary\'s \nreign, the people looked with hope and gladness to the new \nSovereign.  The nation seemed to wake from a horrible dream; and \nHeaven, so long hidden by the smoke of the fires that roasted men \nand women to death, appeared to brighten once more.\n\nQueen Elizabeth was five-and-twenty years of age when she rode \nthrough the streets of London, from the Tower to Westminster Abbey, \nto be crowned.  Her countenance was strongly marked, but on the \nwhole, commanding and dignified; her hair was red, and her nose \nsomething too long and sharp for a woman\'s.  She was not the \nbeautiful creature her courtiers made out; but she was well enough, \nand no doubt looked all the better for coming after the dark and \ngloomy Mary.  She was well educated, but a roundabout writer, and \nrather a hard swearer and coarse talker.  She was clever, but \ncunning and deceitful, and inherited much of her father\'s violent \ntemper.  I mention this now, because she has been so over-praised \nby one party, and so over-abused by another, that it is hardly \npossible to understand the greater part of her reign without first \nunderstanding what kind of woman she really was.\n\nShe began her reign with the great advantage of having a very wise \nand careful Minister, SIR WILLIAM CECIL, whom she afterwards made \nLORD BURLEIGH.  Altogether, the people had greater reason for \nrejoicing than they usually had, when there were processions in the \nstreets; and they were happy with some reason.  All kinds of shows \nand images were set up; GOG and MAGOG were hoisted to the top of \nTemple Bar, and (which was more to the purpose) the Corporation \ndutifully presented the young Queen with the sum of a thousand \nmarks in gold - so heavy a present, that she was obliged to take it \ninto her carriage with both hands.  The coronation was a great \nsuccess; and, on the next day, one of the courtiers presented a \npetition to the new Queen, praying that as it was the custom to \nrelease some prisoners on such occasions, she would have the \ngoodness to release the four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and \nJohn, and also the Apostle Saint Paul, who had been for some time \nshut up in a strange language so that the people could not get at \nthem.\n\nTo this, the Queen replied that it would be better first to inquire \nof themselves whether they desired to be released or not; and, as a \nmeans of finding out, a great public discussion - a sort of \nreligious tournament - was appointed to take place between certain \nchampions of the two religions, in Westminster Abbey.  You may \nsuppose that it was soon made pretty clear to common sense, that \nfor people to benefit by what they repeat or read, it is rather \nnecessary they should understand something about it.  Accordingly, \na Church Service in plain English was settled, and other laws and \nregulations were made, completely establishing the great work of \nthe Reformation.  The Romish bishops and champions were not harshly \ndealt with, all things considered; and the Queen\'s Ministers were \nboth prudent and merciful.\n\nThe one great trouble of this reign, and the unfortunate cause of \nthe greater part of such turmoil and bloodshed as occurred in it, \nwas MARY STUART, QUEEN OF SCOTS.  We will try to understand, in as \nfew words as possible, who Mary was, what she was, and how she came \nto be a thorn in the royal pillow of Elizabeth.\n\nShe was the daughter of the Queen Regent of Scotland, MARY OF \nGUISE.  She had been married, when a mere child, to the Dauphin, \nthe son and heir of the King of France.  The Pope, who pretended \nthat no one could rightfully wear the crown of England without his \ngracious permission, was strongly opposed to Elizabeth, who had not \nasked for the said gracious permission.  And as Mary Queen of Scots \nwould have inherited the English crown in right of her birth, \nsupposing the English Parliament not to have altered the \nsuccession, the Pope himself, and most of the discontented who were \nfollowers of his, maintained that Mary was the rightful Queen of \nEngland, and Elizabeth the wrongful Queen.  Mary being so closely \nconnected with France, and France being jealous of England, there \nwas far greater danger in this than there would have been if she \nhad had no alliance with that great power.  And when her young \nhusband, on the death of his father, became FRANCIS THE SECOND, \nKing of France, the matter grew very serious.  For, the young \ncouple styled themselves King and Queen of England, and the Pope \nwas disposed to help them by doing all the mischief he could.\n\nNow, the reformed religion, under the guidance of a stern and \npowerful preacher, named JOHN KNOX, and other such men, had been \nmaking fierce progress in Scotland.  It was still a half savage \ncountry, where there was a great deal of murdering and rioting \ncontinually going on; and the Reformers, instead of reforming those \nevils as they should have done, went to work in the ferocious old \nScottish spirit, laying churches and chapels waste, pulling down \npictures and altars, and knocking about the Grey Friars, and the \nBlack Friars, and the White Friars, and the friars of all sorts of \ncolours, in all directions.  This obdurate and harsh spirit of the \nScottish Reformers (the Scotch have always been rather a sullen and \nfrowning people in religious matters) put up the blood of the \nRomish French court, and caused France to send troops over to \nScotland, with the hope of setting the friars of all sorts of \ncolours on their legs again; of conquering that country first, and \nEngland afterwards; and so crushing the Reformation all to pieces.  \nThe Scottish Reformers, who had formed a great league which they \ncalled The Congregation of the Lord, secretly represented to \nElizabeth that, if the reformed religion got the worst of it with \nthem, it would be likely to get the worst of it in England too; and \nthus, Elizabeth, though she had a high notion of the rights of \nKings and Queens to do anything they liked, sent an army to \nScotland to support the Reformers, who were in arms against their \nsovereign.  All these proceedings led to a treaty of peace at \nEdinburgh, under which the French consented to depart from the \nkingdom.  By a separate treaty, Mary and her young husband engaged \nto renounce their assumed title of King and Queen of England.  But \nthis treaty they never fulfilled.\n\nIt happened, soon after matters had got to this state, that the \nyoung French King died, leaving Mary a young widow.  She was then \ninvited by her Scottish subjects to return home and reign over \nthem; and as she was not now happy where she was, she, after a \nlittle time, complied.\n\nElizabeth had been Queen three years, when Mary Queen of Scots \nembarked at Calais for her own rough, quarrelling country.  As she \ncame out of the harbour, a vessel was lost before her eyes, and she \nsaid, \'O! good God! what an omen this is for such a voyage!\'  She \nwas very fond of France, and sat on the deck, looking back at it \nand weeping, until it was quite dark.  When she went to bed, she \ndirected to be called at daybreak, if the French coast were still \nvisible, that she might behold it for the last time.  As it proved \nto be a clear morning, this was done, and she again wept for the \ncountry she was leaving, and said many times, \' Farewell, France!  \nFarewell, France!  I shall never see thee again!\'  All this was \nlong remembered afterwards, as sorrowful and interesting in a fair \nyoung princess of nineteen.  Indeed, I am afraid it gradually came, \ntogether with her other distresses, to surround her with greater \nsympathy than she deserved.\n\nWhen she came to Scotland, and took up her abode at the palace of \nHolyrood in Edinburgh, she found herself among uncouth strangers \nand wild uncomfortable customs very different from her experiences \nin the court of France.  The very people who were disposed to love \nher, made her head ache when she was tired out by her voyage, with \na serenade of discordant music - a fearful concert of bagpipes, I \nsuppose - and brought her and her train home to her palace on \nmiserable little Scotch horses that appeared to be half starved.  \nAmong the people who were not disposed to love her, she found the \npowerful leaders of the Reformed Church, who were bitter upon her \namusements, however innocent, and denounced music and dancing as \nworks of the devil.  John Knox himself often lectured her, \nviolently and angrily, and did much to make her life unhappy.  All \nthese reasons confirmed her old attachment to the Romish religion, \nand caused her, there is no doubt, most imprudently and dangerously \nboth for herself and for England too, to give a solemn pledge to \nthe heads of the Romish Church that if she ever succeeded to the \nEnglish crown, she would set up that religion again.  In reading \nher unhappy history, you must always remember this; and also that \nduring her whole life she was constantly put forward against the \nQueen, in some form or other, by the Romish party.\n\nThat Elizabeth, on the other hand, was not inclined to like her, is \npretty certain.  Elizabeth was very vain and jealous, and had an \nextraordinary dislike to people being married.  She treated Lady \nCatherine Grey, sister of the beheaded Lady Jane, with such \nshameful severity, for no other reason than her being secretly \nmarried, that she died and her husband was ruined; so, when a \nsecond marriage for Mary began to be talked about, probably \nElizabeth disliked her more.  Not that Elizabeth wanted suitors of \nher own, for they started up from Spain, Austria, Sweden, and \nEngland.  Her English lover at this time, and one whom she much \nfavoured too, was LORD ROBERT DUDLEY, Earl of Leicester - himself \nsecretly married to AMY ROBSART, the daughter of an English \ngentleman, whom he was strongly suspected of causing to be \nmurdered, down at his country seat, Cumnor Hall in Berkshire, that \nhe might be free to marry the Queen.  Upon this story, the great \nwriter, SIR WALTER SCOTT, has founded one of his best romances.  \nBut if Elizabeth knew how to lead her handsome favourite on, for \nher own vanity and pleasure, she knew how to stop him for her own \npride; and his love, and all the other proposals, came to nothing.  \nThe Queen always declared in good set speeches, that she would \nnever be married at all, but would live and die a Maiden Queen.  It \nwas a very pleasant and meritorious declaration, I suppose; but it \nhas been puffed and trumpeted so much, that I am rather tired of it \nmyself.\n\nDivers princes proposed to marry Mary, but the English court had \nreasons for being jealous of them all, and even proposed as a \nmatter of policy that she should marry that very Earl of Leicester \nwho had aspired to be the husband of Elizabeth.  At last, LORD \nDARNLEY, son of the Earl of Lennox, and himself descended from the \nRoyal Family of Scotland, went over with Elizabeth\'s consent to try \nhis fortune at Holyrood.  He was a tall simpleton; and could dance \nand play the guitar; but I know of nothing else he could do, unless \nit were to get very drunk, and eat gluttonously, and make a \ncontemptible spectacle of himself in many mean and vain ways.  \nHowever, he gained Mary\'s heart, not disdaining in the pursuit of \nhis object to ally himself with one of her secretaries, DAVID \nRIZZIO, who had great influence with her.  He soon married the \nQueen.  This marriage does not say much for her, but what followed \nwill presently say less.\n\nMary\'s brother, the EARL OF MURRAY, and head of the Protestant \nparty in Scotland, had opposed this marriage, partly on religious \ngrounds, and partly perhaps from personal dislike of the very \ncontemptible bridegroom.  When it had taken place, through Mary\'s \ngaining over to it the more powerful of the lords about her, she \nbanished Murray for his pains; and, when he and some other nobles \nrose in arms to support the reformed religion, she herself, within \na month of her wedding day, rode against them in armour with loaded \npistols in her saddle.  Driven out of Scotland, they presented \nthemselves before Elizabeth - who called them traitors in public, \nand assisted them in private, according to her crafty nature.\n\nMary had been married but a little while, when she began to hate \nher husband, who, in his turn, began to hate that David Rizzio, \nwith whom he had leagued to gain her favour, and whom he now \nbelieved to be her lover.  He hated Rizzio to that extent, that he \nmade a compact with LORD RUTHVEN and three other lords to get rid \nof him by murder.  This wicked agreement they made in solemn \nsecrecy upon the first of March, fifteen hundred and sixty-six, and \non the night of Saturday the ninth, the conspirators were brought \nby Darnley up a private staircase, dark and steep, into a range of \nrooms where they knew that Mary was sitting at supper with her \nsister, Lady Argyle, and this doomed man.  When they went into the \nroom, Darnley took the Queen round the waist, and Lord Ruthven, who \nhad risen from a bed of sickness to do this murder, came in, gaunt \nand ghastly, leaning on two men.  Rizzio ran behind the Queen for \nshelter and protection.  \'Let him come out of the room,\' said \nRuthven.  \'He shall not leave the room,\' replied the Queen; \'I read \nhis danger in your face, and it is my will that he remain here.\'  \nThey then set upon him, struggled with him, overturned the table, \ndragged him out, and killed him with fifty-six stabs.  When the \nQueen heard that he was dead, she said, \'No more tears.  I will \nthink now of revenge!\'\n\nWithin a day or two, she gained her husband over, and prevailed on \nthe tall idiot to abandon the conspirators and fly with her to \nDunbar.  There, he issued a proclamation, audaciously and falsely \ndenying that he had any knowledge of the late bloody business; and \nthere they were joined by the EARL BOTHWELL and some other nobles.  \nWith their help, they raised eight thousand men; returned to \nEdinburgh, and drove the assassins into England.  Mary soon \nafterwards gave birth to a son - still thinking of revenge.\n\nThat she should have had a greater scorn for her husband after his \nlate cowardice and treachery than she had had before, was natural \nenough.  There is little doubt that she now began to love Bothwell \ninstead, and to plan with him means of getting rid of Darnley.  \nBothwell had such power over her that he induced her even to pardon \nthe assassins of Rizzio.  The arrangements for the Christening of \nthe young Prince were entrusted to him, and he was one of the most \nimportant people at the ceremony, where the child was named JAMES:  \nElizabeth being his godmother, though not present on the occasion.  \nA week afterwards, Darnley, who had left Mary and gone to his \nfather\'s house at Glasgow, being taken ill with the small-pox, she \nsent her own physician to attend him.  But there is reason to \napprehend that this was merely a show and a pretence, and that she \nknew what was doing, when Bothwell within another month proposed to \none of the late conspirators against Rizzio, to murder Darnley, \n\'for that it was the Queen\'s mind that he should be taken away.\'  \nIt is certain that on that very day she wrote to her ambassador in \nFrance, complaining of him, and yet went immediately to Glasgow, \nfeigning to be very anxious about him, and to love him very much.  \nIf she wanted to get him in her power, she succeeded to her heart\'s \ncontent; for she induced him to go back with her to Edinburgh, and \nto occupy, instead of the palace, a lone house outside the city \ncalled the Kirk of Field.  Here, he lived for about a week.  One \nSunday night, she remained with him until ten o\'clock, and then \nleft him, to go to Holyrood to be present at an entertainment given \nin celebration of the marriage of one of her favourite servants.  \nAt two o\'clock in the morning the city was shaken by a great \nexplosion, and the Kirk of Field was blown to atoms.\n\nDarnley\'s body was found next day lying under a tree at some \ndistance.  How it came there, undisfigured and unscorched by \ngunpowder, and how this crime came to be so clumsily and strangely \ncommitted, it is impossible to discover.  The deceitful character \nof Mary, and the deceitful character of Elizabeth, have rendered \nalmost every part of their joint history uncertain and obscure.  \nBut, I fear that Mary was unquestionably a party to her husband\'s \nmurder, and that this was the revenge she had threatened.  The \nScotch people universally believed it.  Voices cried out in the \nstreets of Edinburgh in the dead of the night, for justice on the \nmurderess.  Placards were posted by unknown hands in the public \nplaces denouncing Bothwell as the murderer, and the Queen as his \naccomplice; and, when he afterwards married her (though himself \nalready married), previously making a show of taking her prisoner \nby force, the indignation of the people knew no bounds.  The women \nparticularly are described as having been quite frantic against the \nQueen, and to have hooted and cried after her in the streets with \nterrific vehemence.\n\nSuch guilty unions seldom prosper.  This husband and wife had lived \ntogether but a month, when they were separated for ever by the \nsuccesses of a band of Scotch nobles who associated against them \nfor the protection of the young Prince:  whom Bothwell had vainly \nendeavoured to lay hold of, and whom he would certainly have \nmurdered, if the EARL OF MAR, in whose hands the boy was, had not \nbeen firmly and honourably faithful to his trust.  Before this \nangry power, Bothwell fled abroad, where he died, a prisoner and \nmad, nine miserable years afterwards.  Mary being found by the \nassociated lords to deceive them at every turn, was sent a prisoner \nto Lochleven Castle; which, as it stood in the midst of a lake, \ncould only be approached by boat.  Here, one LORD LINDSAY, who was \nso much of a brute that the nobles would have done better if they \nhad chosen a mere gentleman for their messenger, made her sign her \nabdication, and appoint Murray, Regent of Scotland.  Here, too, \nMurray saw her in a sorrowing and humbled state.\n\nShe had better have remained in the castle of Lochleven, dull \nprison as it was, with the rippling of the lake against it, and the \nmoving shadows of the water on the room walls; but she could not \nrest there, and more than once tried to escape.  The first time she \nhad nearly succeeded, dressed in the clothes of her own washer-\nwoman, but, putting up her hand to prevent one of the boatmen from \nlifting her veil, the men suspected her, seeing how white it was, \nand rowed her back again.  A short time afterwards, her fascinating \nmanners enlisted in her cause a boy in the Castle, called the \nlittle DOUGLAS, who, while the family were at supper, stole the \nkeys of the great gate, went softly out with the Queen, locked the \ngate on the outside, and rowed her away across the lake, sinking \nthe keys as they went along.  On the opposite shore she was met by \nanother Douglas, and some few lords; and, so accompanied, rode away \non horseback to Hamilton, where they raised three thousand men.  \nHere, she issued a proclamation declaring that the abdication she \nhad signed in her prison was illegal, and requiring the Regent to \nyield to his lawful Queen.  Being a steady soldier, and in no way \ndiscomposed although he was without an army, Murray pretended to \ntreat with her, until he had collected a force about half equal to \nher own, and then he gave her battle.  In one quarter of an hour he \ncut down all her hopes.  She had another weary ride on horse-back \nof sixty long Scotch miles, and took shelter at Dundrennan Abbey, \nwhence she fled for safety to Elizabeth\'s dominions.\n\nMary Queen of Scots came to England - to her own ruin, the trouble \nof the kingdom, and the misery and death of many - in the year one \nthousand five hundred and sixty-eight.  How she left it and the \nworld, nineteen years afterwards, we have now to see.\n\n\nSECOND PART\n\n\nWHEN Mary Queen of Scots arrived in England, without money and even \nwithout any other clothes than those she wore, she wrote to \nElizabeth, representing herself as an innocent and injured piece of \nRoyalty, and entreating her assistance to oblige her Scottish \nsubjects to take her back again and obey her.  But, as her \ncharacter was already known in England to be a very different one \nfrom what she made it out to be, she was told in answer that she \nmust first clear herself.  Made uneasy by this condition, Mary, \nrather than stay in England, would have gone to Spain, or to \nFrance, or would even have gone back to Scotland.  But, as her \ndoing either would have been likely to trouble England afresh, it \nwas decided that she should be detained here.  She first came to \nCarlisle, and, after that, was moved about from castle to castle, \nas was considered necessary; but England she never left again.\n\nAfter trying very hard to get rid of the necessity of clearing \nherself, Mary, advised by LORD HERRIES, her best friend in England, \nagreed to answer the charges against her, if the Scottish noblemen \nwho made them would attend to maintain them before such English \nnoblemen as Elizabeth might appoint for that purpose.  Accordingly, \nsuch an assembly, under the name of a conference, met, first at \nYork, and afterwards at Hampton Court.  In its presence Lord \nLennox, Darnley\'s father, openly charged Mary with the murder of \nhis son; and whatever Mary\'s friends may now say or write in her \nbehalf, there is no doubt that, when her brother Murray produced \nagainst her a casket containing certain guilty letters and verses \nwhich he stated to have passed between her and Bothwell, she \nwithdrew from the inquiry.  Consequently, it is to be supposed that \nshe was then considered guilty by those who had the best \nopportunities of judging of the truth, and that the feeling which \nafterwards arose in her behalf was a very generous but not a very \nreasonable one.\n\nHowever, the DUKE OF NORFOLK, an honourable but rather weak \nnobleman, partly because Mary was captivating, partly because he \nwas ambitious, partly because he was over-persuaded by artful \nplotters against Elizabeth, conceived a strong idea that he would \nlike to marry the Queen of Scots - though he was a little \nfrightened, too, by the letters in the casket.  This idea being \nsecretly encouraged by some of the noblemen of Elizabeth\'s court, \nand even by the favourite Earl of Leicester (because it was \nobjected to by other favourites who were his rivals), Mary \nexpressed her approval of it, and the King of France and the King \nof Spain are supposed to have done the same.  It was not so quietly \nplanned, though, but that it came to Elizabeth\'s ears, who warned \nthe Duke \'to be careful what sort of pillow he was going to lay his \nhead upon.\'  He made a humble reply at the time; but turned sulky \nsoon afterwards, and, being considered dangerous, was sent to the \nTower.\n\nThus, from the moment of Mary\'s coming to England she began to be \nthe centre of plots and miseries.\n\nA rise of the Catholics in the north was the next of these, and it \nwas only checked by many executions and much bloodshed.  It was \nfollowed by a great conspiracy of the Pope and some of the Catholic \nsovereigns of Europe to depose Elizabeth, place Mary on the throne, \nand restore the unreformed religion.  It is almost impossible to \ndoubt that Mary knew and approved of this; and the Pope himself was \nso hot in the matter that he issued a bull, in which he openly \ncalled Elizabeth the \'pretended Queen\' of England, excommunicated \nher, and excommunicated all her subjects who should continue to \nobey her.  A copy of this miserable paper got into London, and was \nfound one morning publicly posted on the Bishop of London\'s gate.  \nA great hue and cry being raised, another copy was found in the \nchamber of a student of Lincoln\'s Inn, who confessed, being put \nupon the rack, that he had received it from one JOHN FELTON, a rich \ngentleman who lived across the Thames, near Southwark.  This John \nFelton, being put upon the rack too, confessed that he had posted \nthe placard on the Bishop\'s gate.  For this offence he was, within \nfour days, taken to St. Paul\'s Churchyard, and there hanged and \nquartered.  As to the Pope\'s bull, the people by the reformation \nhaving thrown off the Pope, did not care much, you may suppose, for \nthe Pope\'s throwing off them.  It was a mere dirty piece of paper, \nand not half so powerful as a street ballad.\n\nOn the very day when Felton was brought to his trial, the poor Duke \nof Norfolk was released.  It would have been well for him if he had \nkept away from the Tower evermore, and from the snares that had \ntaken him there.  But, even while he was in that dismal place he \ncorresponded with Mary, and as soon as he was out of it, he began \nto plot again.  Being discovered in correspondence with the Pope, \nwith a view to a rising in England which should force Elizabeth to \nconsent to his marriage with Mary and to repeal the laws against \nthe Catholics, he was re-committed to the Tower and brought to \ntrial.  He was found guilty by the unanimous verdict of the Lords \nwho tried him, and was sentenced to the block.\n\nIt is very difficult to make out, at this distance of time, and \nbetween opposite accounts, whether Elizabeth really was a humane \nwoman, or desired to appear so, or was fearful of shedding the \nblood of people of great name who were popular in the country.  \nTwice she commanded and countermanded the execution of this Duke, \nand it did not take place until five months after his trial.  The \nscaffold was erected on Tower Hill, and there he died like a brave \nman.  He refused to have his eyes bandaged, saying that he was not \nat all afraid of death; and he admitted the justice of his \nsentence, and was much regretted by the people.\n\nAlthough Mary had shrunk at the most important time from disproving \nher guilt, she was very careful never to do anything that would \nadmit it.  All such proposals as were made to her by Elizabeth for \nher release, required that admission in some form or other, and \ntherefore came to nothing.  Moreover, both women being artful and \ntreacherous, and neither ever trusting the other, it was not likely \nthat they could ever make an agreement.  So, the Parliament, \naggravated by what the Pope had done, made new and strong laws \nagainst the spreading of the Catholic religion in England, and \ndeclared it treason in any one to say that the Queen and her \nsuccessors were not the lawful sovereigns of England.  It would \nhave done more than this, but for Elizabeth\'s moderation.\n\nSince the Reformation, there had come to be three great sects of \nreligious people - or people who called themselves so - in England; \nthat is to say, those who belonged to the Reformed Church, those \nwho belonged to the Unreformed Church, and those who were called \nthe Puritans, because they said that they wanted to have everything \nvery pure and plain in all the Church service.  These last were for \nthe most part an uncomfortable people, who thought it highly \nmeritorious to dress in a hideous manner, talk through their noses, \nand oppose all harmless enjoyments.  But they were powerful too, \nand very much in earnest, and they were one and all the determined \nenemies of the Queen of Scots.  The Protestant feeling in England \nwas further strengthened by the tremendous cruelties to which \nProtestants were exposed in France and in the Netherlands.  Scores \nof thousands of them were put to death in those countries with \nevery cruelty that can be imagined, and at last, in the autumn of \nthe year one thousand five hundred and seventy-two, one of the \ngreatest barbarities ever committed in the world took place at \nParis.\n\nIt is called in history, THE MASSACRE OF SAINT BARTHOLOMEW, because \nit took place on Saint Bartholomew\'s Eve.  The day fell on Saturday \nthe twenty-third of August.  On that day all the great leaders of \nthe Protestants (who were there called HUGUENOTS) were assembled \ntogether, for the purpose, as was represented to them, of doing \nhonour to the marriage of their chief, the young King of Navarre, \nwith the sister of CHARLES THE NINTH:  a miserable young King who \nthen occupied the French throne.  This dull creature was made to \nbelieve by his mother and other fierce Catholics about him that the \nHuguenots meant to take his life; and he was persuaded to give \nsecret orders that, on the tolling of a great bell, they should be \nfallen upon by an overpowering force of armed men, and slaughtered \nwherever they could be found.  When the appointed hour was close at \nhand, the stupid wretch, trembling from head to foot, was taken \ninto a balcony by his mother to see the atrocious work begun.  The \nmoment the bell tolled, the murderers broke forth.  During all that \nnight and the two next days, they broke into the houses, fired the \nhouses, shot and stabbed the Protestants, men, women, and children, \nand flung their bodies into the streets.  They were shot at in the \nstreets as they passed along, and their blood ran down the gutters.  \nUpwards of ten thousand Protestants were killed in Paris alone; in \nall France four or five times that number.  To return thanks to \nHeaven for these diabolical murders, the Pope and his train \nactually went in public procession at Rome, and as if this were not \nshame enough for them, they had a medal struck to commemorate the \nevent.  But, however comfortable the wholesale murders were to \nthese high authorities, they had not that soothing effect upon the \ndoll-King.  I am happy to state that he never knew a moment\'s peace \nafterwards; that he was continually crying out that he saw the \nHuguenots covered with blood and wounds falling dead before him; \nand that he died within a year, shrieking and yelling and raving to \nthat degree, that if all the Popes who had ever lived had been \nrolled into one, they would not have afforded His guilty Majesty \nthe slightest consolation.\n\nWhen the terrible news of the massacre arrived in England, it made \na powerful impression indeed upon the people.  If they began to run \na little wild against the Catholics at about this time, this \nfearful reason for it, coming so soon after the days of bloody \nQueen Mary, must be remembered in their excuse.  The Court was not \nquite so honest as the people - but perhaps it sometimes is not.  \nIt received the French ambassador, with all the lords and ladies \ndressed in deep mourning, and keeping a profound silence.  \nNevertheless, a proposal of marriage which he had made to Elizabeth \nonly two days before the eve of Saint Bartholomew, on behalf of the \nDuke of Alenáon, the French King\'s brother, a boy of seventeen, \nstill went on; while on the other hand, in her usual crafty way, \nthe Queen secretly supplied the Huguenots with money and weapons.\n\nI must say that for a Queen who made all those fine speeches, of \nwhich I have confessed myself to be rather tired, about living and \ndying a Maiden Queen, Elizabeth was \'going\' to be married pretty \noften.  Besides always having some English favourite or other whom \nshe by turns encouraged and swore at and knocked about - for the \nmaiden Queen was very free with her fists - she held this French \nDuke off and on through several years.  When he at last came over \nto England, the marriage articles were actually drawn up, and it \nwas settled that the wedding should take place in six weeks.  The \nQueen was then so bent upon it, that she prosecuted a poor Puritan \nnamed STUBBS, and a poor bookseller named PAGE, for writing and \npublishing a pamphlet against it.  Their right hands were chopped \noff for this crime; and poor Stubbs - more loyal than I should have \nbeen myself under the circumstances - immediately pulled off his \nhat with his left hand, and cried, \'God save the Queen!\'  Stubbs \nwas cruelly treated; for the marriage never took place after all, \nthough the Queen pledged herself to the Duke with a ring from her \nown finger.  He went away, no better than he came, when the \ncourtship had lasted some ten years altogether; and he died a \ncouple of years afterwards, mourned by Elizabeth, who appears to \nhave been really fond of him.  It is not much to her credit, for he \nwas a bad enough member of a bad family.\n\nTo return to the Catholics.  There arose two orders of priests, who \nwere very busy in England, and who were much dreaded.  These were \nthe JESUITS (who were everywhere in all sorts of disguises), and \nthe SEMINARY PRIESTS.  The people had a great horror of the first, \nbecause they were known to have taught that murder was lawful if it \nwere done with an object of which they approved; and they had a \ngreat horror of the second, because they came to teach the old \nreligion, and to be the successors of \'Queen Mary\'s priests,\' as \nthose yet lingering in England were called, when they should die \nout.  The severest laws were made against them, and were most \nunmercifully executed.  Those who sheltered them in their houses \noften suffered heavily for what was an act of humanity; and the \nrack, that cruel torture which tore men\'s limbs asunder, was \nconstantly kept going.  What these unhappy men confessed, or what \nwas ever confessed by any one under that agony, must always be \nreceived with great doubt, as it is certain that people have \nfrequently owned to the most absurd and impossible crimes to escape \nsuch dreadful suffering.  But I cannot doubt it to have been proved \nby papers, that there were many plots, both among the Jesuits, and \nwith France, and with Scotland, and with Spain, for the destruction \nof Queen Elizabeth, for the placing of Mary on the throne, and for \nthe revival of the old religion.\n\nIf the English people were too ready to believe in plots, there \nwere, as I have said, good reasons for it.  When the massacre of \nSaint Bartholomew was yet fresh in their recollection, a great \nProtestant Dutch hero, the PRINCE OF ORANGE, was shot by an \nassassin, who confessed that he had been kept and trained for the \npurpose in a college of Jesuits.  The Dutch, in this surprise and \ndistress, offered to make Elizabeth their sovereign, but she \ndeclined the honour, and sent them a small army instead, under the \ncommand of the Earl of Leicester, who, although a capital Court \nfavourite, was not much of a general.  He did so little in Holland, \nthat his campaign there would probably have been forgotten, but for \nits occasioning the death of one of the best writers, the best \nknights, and the best gentlemen, of that or any age.  This was SIR \nPHILIP SIDNEY, who was wounded by a musket ball in the thigh as he \nmounted a fresh horse, after having had his own killed under him.  \nHe had to ride back wounded, a long distance, and was very faint \nwith fatigue and loss of blood, when some water, for which he had \neagerly asked, was handed to him.  But he was so good and gentle \neven then, that seeing a poor badly wounded common soldier lying on \nthe ground, looking at the water with longing eyes, he said, \'Thy \nnecessity is greater than mine,\' and gave it up to him.  This \ntouching action of a noble heart is perhaps as well known as any \nincident in history - is as famous far and wide as the blood-\nstained Tower of London, with its axe, and block, and murders out \nof number.  So delightful is an act of true humanity, and so glad \nare mankind to remember it.\n\nAt home, intelligence of plots began to thicken every day.  I \nsuppose the people never did live under such continual terrors as \nthose by which they were possessed now, of Catholic risings, and \nburnings, and poisonings, and I don\'t know what.  Still, we must \nalways remember that they lived near and close to awful realities \nof that kind, and that with their experience it was not difficult \nto believe in any enormity.  The government had the same fear, and \ndid not take the best means of discovering the truth - for, besides \ntorturing the suspected, it employed paid spies, who will always \nlie for their own profit.  It even made some of the conspiracies it \nbrought to light, by sending false letters to disaffected people, \ninviting them to join in pretended plots, which they too readily \ndid.\n\nBut, one great real plot was at length discovered, and it ended the \ncareer of Mary, Queen of Scots.  A seminary priest named BALLARD, \nand a Spanish soldier named SAVAGE, set on and encouraged by \ncertain French priests, imparted a design to one ANTONY BABINGTON - \na gentleman of fortune in Derbyshire, who had been for some time a \nsecret agent of Mary\'s - for murdering the Queen.  Babington then \nconfided the scheme to some other Catholic gentlemen who were his \nfriends, and they joined in it heartily.  They were vain, weak-\nheaded young men, ridiculously confident, and preposterously proud \nof their plan; for they got a gimcrack painting made, of the six \nchoice spirits who were to murder Elizabeth, with Babington in an \nattitude for the centre figure.  Two of their number, however, one \nof whom was a priest, kept Elizabeth\'s wisest minister, SIR FRANCIS \nWALSINGHAM, acquainted with the whole project from the first.  The \nconspirators were completely deceived to the final point, when \nBabington gave Savage, because he was shabby, a ring from his \nfinger, and some money from his purse, wherewith to buy himself new \nclothes in which to kill the Queen.  Walsingham, having then full \nevidence against the whole band, and two letters of Mary\'s besides, \nresolved to seize them.  Suspecting something wrong, they stole out \nof the city, one by one, and hid themselves in St. John\'s Wood, and \nother places which really were hiding places then; but they were \nall taken, and all executed.  When they were seized, a gentleman \nwas sent from Court to inform Mary of the fact, and of her being \ninvolved in the discovery.  Her friends have complained that she \nwas kept in very hard and severe custody.  It does not appear very \nlikely, for she was going out a hunting that very morning.\n\nQueen Elizabeth had been warned long ago, by one in France who had \ngood information of what was secretly doing, that in holding Mary \nalive, she held \'the wolf who would devour her.\'  The Bishop of \nLondon had, more lately, given the Queen\'s favourite minister the \nadvice in writing, \'forthwith to cut off the Scottish Queen\'s \nhead.\'  The question now was, what to do with her?  The Earl of \nLeicester wrote a little note home from Holland, recommending that \nshe should be quietly poisoned; that noble favourite having \naccustomed his mind, it is possible, to remedies of that nature.  \nHis black advice, however, was disregarded, and she was brought to \ntrial at Fotheringay Castle in Northamptonshire, before a tribunal \nof forty, composed of both religions.  There, and in the Star \nChamber at Westminster, the trial lasted a fortnight.  She defended \nherself with great ability, but could only deny the confessions \nthat had been made by Babington and others; could only call her own \nletters, produced against her by her own secretaries, forgeries; \nand, in short, could only deny everything.  She was found guilty, \nand declared to have incurred the penalty of death.  The Parliament \nmet, approved the sentence, and prayed the Queen to have it \nexecuted.  The Queen replied that she requested them to consider \nwhether no means could be found of saving Mary\'s life without \nendangering her own.  The Parliament rejoined, No; and the citizens \nilluminated their houses and lighted bonfires, in token of their \njoy that all these plots and troubles were to be ended by the death \nof the Queen of Scots.\n\nShe, feeling sure that her time was now come, wrote a letter to the \nQueen of England, making three entreaties; first, that she might be \nburied in France; secondly, that she might not be executed in \nsecret, but before her servants and some others; thirdly, that \nafter her death, her servants should not be molested, but should be \nsuffered to go home with the legacies she left them.  It was an \naffecting letter, and Elizabeth shed tears over it, but sent no \nanswer.  Then came a special ambassador from France, and another \nfrom Scotland, to intercede for Mary\'s life; and then the nation \nbegan to clamour, more and more, for her death.\n\nWhat the real feelings or intentions of Elizabeth were, can never \nbe known now; but I strongly suspect her of only wishing one thing \nmore than Mary\'s death, and that was to keep free of the blame of \nit.  On the first of February, one thousand five hundred and \neighty-seven, Lord Burleigh having drawn out the warrant for the \nexecution, the Queen sent to the secretary DAVISON to bring it to \nher, that she might sign it:  which she did.  Next day, when \nDavison told her it was sealed, she angrily asked him why such \nhaste was necessary?  Next day but one, she joked about it, and \nswore a little.  Again, next day but one, she seemed to complain \nthat it was not yet done, but still she would not be plain with \nthose about her.  So, on the seventh, the Earls of Kent and \nShrewsbury, with the Sheriff of Northamptonshire, came with the \nwarrant to Fotheringay, to tell the Queen of Scots to prepare for \ndeath.\n\nWhen those messengers of ill omen were gone, Mary made a frugal \nsupper, drank to her servants, read over her will, went to bed, \nslept for some hours, and then arose and passed the remainder of \nthe night saying prayers.  In the morning she dressed herself in \nher best clothes; and, at eight o\'clock when the sheriff came for \nher to her chapel, took leave of her servants who were there \nassembled praying with her, and went down-stairs, carrying a Bible \nin one hand and a crucifix in the other.  Two of her women and four \nof her men were allowed to be present in the hall; where a low \nscaffold, only two feet from the ground, was erected and covered \nwith black; and where the executioner from the Tower, and his \nassistant, stood, dressed in black velvet.  The hall was full of \npeople.  While the sentence was being read she sat upon a stool; \nand, when it was finished, she again denied her guilt, as she had \ndone before.  The Earl of Kent and the Dean of Peterborough, in \ntheir Protestant zeal, made some very unnecessary speeches to her; \nto which she replied that she died in the Catholic religion, and \nthey need not trouble themselves about that matter.  When her head \nand neck were uncovered by the executioners, she said that she had \nnot been used to be undressed by such hands, or before so much \ncompany.  Finally, one of her women fastened a cloth over her face, \nand she laid her neck upon the block, and repeated more than once \nin Latin, \'Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit!\'  Some say \nher head was struck off in two blows, some say in three.  However \nthat be, when it was held up, streaming with blood, the real hair \nbeneath the false hair she had long worn was seen to be as grey as \nthat of a woman of seventy, though she was at that time only in her \nforty-sixth year.  All her beauty was gone.\n\nBut she was beautiful enough to her little dog, who cowered under \nher dress, frightened, when she went upon the scaffold, and who lay \ndown beside her headless body when all her earthly sorrows were \nover.\n\n\nTHIRD PART\n\n\nON its being formally made known to Elizabeth that the sentence had \nbeen executed on the Queen of Scots, she showed the utmost grief \nand rage, drove her favourites from her with violent indignation, \nand sent Davison to the Tower; from which place he was only \nreleased in the end by paying an immense fine which completely \nruined him.  Elizabeth not only over-acted her part in making these \npretences, but most basely reduced to poverty one of her faithful \nservants for no other fault than obeying her commands.\n\nJames, King of Scotland, Mary\'s son, made a show likewise of being \nvery angry on the occasion; but he was a pensioner of England to \nthe amount of five thousand pounds a year, and he had known very \nlittle of his mother, and he possibly regarded her as the murderer \nof his father, and he soon took it quietly.\n\nPhilip, King of Spain, however, threatened to do greater things \nthan ever had been done yet, to set up the Catholic religion and \npunish Protestant England.  Elizabeth, hearing that he and the \nPrince of Parma were making great preparations for this purpose, in \norder to be beforehand with them sent out ADMIRAL DRAKE (a famous \nnavigator, who had sailed about the world, and had already brought \ngreat plunder from Spain) to the port of Cadiz, where he burnt a \nhundred vessels full of stores.  This great loss obliged the \nSpaniards to put off the invasion for a year; but it was none the \nless formidable for that, amounting to one hundred and thirty \nships, nineteen thousand soldiers, eight thousand sailors, two \nthousand slaves, and between two and three thousand great guns.  \nEngland was not idle in making ready to resist this great force.  \nAll the men between sixteen years old and sixty, were trained and \ndrilled; the national fleet of ships (in number only thirty-four at \nfirst) was enlarged by public contributions and by private ships, \nfitted out by noblemen; the city of London, of its own accord, \nfurnished double the number of ships and men that it was required \nto provide; and, if ever the national spirit was up in England, it \nwas up all through the country to resist the Spaniards.  Some of \nthe Queen\'s advisers were for seizing the principal English \nCatholics, and putting them to death; but the Queen - who, to her \nhonour, used to say, that she would never believe any ill of her \nsubjects, which a parent would not believe of her own children - \nrejected the advice, and only confined a few of those who were the \nmost suspected, in the fens in Lincolnshire.  The great body of \nCatholics deserved this confidence; for they behaved most loyally, \nnobly, and bravely.\n\nSo, with all England firing up like one strong, angry man, and with \nboth sides of the Thames fortified, and with the soldiers under \narms, and with the sailors in their ships, the country waited for \nthe coming of the proud Spanish fleet, which was called THE \nINVINCIBLE ARMADA.  The Queen herself, riding in armour on a white \nhorse, and the Earl of Essex and the Earl of Leicester holding her \nbridal rein, made a brave speech to the troops at Tilbury Fort \nopposite Gravesend, which was received with such enthusiasm as is \nseldom known.  Then came the Spanish Armada into the English \nChannel, sailing along in the form of a half moon, of such great \nsize that it was seven miles broad.  But the English were quickly \nupon it, and woe then to all the Spanish ships that dropped a \nlittle out of the half moon, for the English took them instantly!  \nAnd it soon appeared that the great Armada was anything but \ninvincible, for on a summer night, bold Drake sent eight blazing \nfire-ships right into the midst of it.  In terrible consternation \nthe Spaniards tried to get out to sea, and so became dispersed; the \nEnglish pursued them at a great advantage; a storm came on, and \ndrove the Spaniards among rocks and shoals; and the swift end of \nthe Invincible fleet was, that it lost thirty great ships and ten \nthousand men, and, defeated and disgraced, sailed home again.  \nBeing afraid to go by the English Channel, it sailed all round \nScotland and Ireland; some of the ships getting cast away on the \nlatter coast in bad weather, the Irish, who were a kind of savages, \nplundered those vessels and killed their crews.  So ended this \ngreat attempt to invade and conquer England.  And I think it will \nbe a long time before any other invincible fleet coming to England \nwith the same object, will fare much better than the Spanish \nArmada.\n\nThough the Spanish king had had this bitter taste of English \nbravery, he was so little the wiser for it, as still to entertain \nhis old designs, and even to conceive the absurd idea of placing \nhis daughter on the English throne.  But the Earl of Essex, SIR \nWALTER RALEIGH, SIR THOMAS HOWARD, and some other distinguished \nleaders, put to sea from Plymouth, entered the port of Cadiz once \nmore, obtained a complete victory over the shipping assembled \nthere, and got possession of the town.  In obedience to the Queen\'s \nexpress instructions, they behaved with great humanity; and the \nprincipal loss of the Spaniards was a vast sum of money which they \nhad to pay for ransom.  This was one of many gallant achievements \non the sea, effected in this reign.  Sir Walter Raleigh himself, \nafter marrying a maid of honour and giving offence to the Maiden \nQueen thereby, had already sailed to South America in search of \ngold.\n\nThe Earl of Leicester was now dead, and so was Sir Thomas \nWalsingham, whom Lord Burleigh was soon to follow.  The principal \nfavourite was the EARL OF ESSEX, a spirited and handsome man, a \nfavourite with the people too as well as with the Queen, and \npossessed of many admirable qualities.  It was much debated at \nCourt whether there should be peace with Spain or no, and he was \nvery urgent for war.  He also tried hard to have his own way in the \nappointment of a deputy to govern in Ireland.  One day, while this \nquestion was in dispute, he hastily took offence, and turned his \nback upon the Queen; as a gentle reminder of which impropriety, the \nQueen gave him a tremendous box on the ear, and told him to go to \nthe devil.  He went home instead, and did not reappear at Court for \nhalf a year or so, when he and the Queen were reconciled, though \nnever (as some suppose) thoroughly.\n\nFrom this time the fate of the Earl of Essex and that of the Queen \nseemed to be blended together.  The Irish were still perpetually \nquarrelling and fighting among themselves, and he went over to \nIreland as Lord Lieutenant, to the great joy of his enemies (Sir \nWalter Raleigh among the rest), who were glad to have so dangerous \na rival far off.  Not being by any means successful there, and \nknowing that his enemies would take advantage of that circumstance \nto injure him with the Queen, he came home again, though against \nher orders.  The Queen being taken by surprise when he appeared \nbefore her, gave him her hand to kiss, and he was overjoyed - \nthough it was not a very lovely hand by this time - but in the \ncourse of the same day she ordered him to confine himself to his \nroom, and two or three days afterwards had him taken into custody.  \nWith the same sort of caprice - and as capricious an old woman she \nnow was, as ever wore a crown or a head either - she sent him broth \nfrom her own table on his falling ill from anxiety, and cried about \nhim.\n\nHe was a man who could find comfort and occupation in his books, \nand he did so for a time; not the least happy time, I dare say, of \nhis life.  But it happened unfortunately for him, that he held a \nmonopoly in sweet wines:  which means that nobody could sell them \nwithout purchasing his permission.  This right, which was only for \na term, expiring, he applied to have it renewed.  The Queen \nrefused, with the rather strong observation - but she DID make \nstrong observations - that an unruly beast must be stinted in his \nfood.  Upon this, the angry Earl, who had been already deprived of \nmany offices, thought himself in danger of complete ruin, and \nturned against the Queen, whom he called a vain old woman who had \ngrown as crooked in her mind as she had in her figure.  These \nuncomplimentary expressions the ladies of the Court immediately \nsnapped up and carried to the Queen, whom they did not put in a \nbetter tempter, you may believe.  The same Court ladies, when they \nhad beautiful dark hair of their own, used to wear false red hair, \nto be like the Queen.  So they were not very high-spirited ladies, \nhowever high in rank.\n\nThe worst object of the Earl of Essex, and some friends of his who \nused to meet at LORD SOUTHAMPTON\'S house, was to obtain possession \nof the Queen, and oblige her by force to dismiss her ministers and \nchange her favourites.  On Saturday the seventh of February, one \nthousand six hundred and one, the council suspecting this, summoned \nthe Earl to come before them.  He, pretending to be ill, declined; \nit was then settled among his friends, that as the next day would \nbe Sunday, when many of the citizens usually assembled at the Cross \nby St. Paul\'s Cathedral, he should make one bold effort to induce \nthem to rise and follow him to the Palace.\n\nSo, on the Sunday morning, he and a small body of adherents started \nout of his house - Essex House by the Strand, with steps to the \nriver - having first shut up in it, as prisoners, some members of \nthe council who came to examine him - and hurried into the City \nwith the Earl at their head crying out \'For the Queen!  For the \nQueen!  A plot is laid for my life!\'  No one heeded them, however, \nand when they came to St. Paul\'s there were no citizens there.  In \nthe meantime the prisoners at Essex House had been released by one \nof the Earl\'s own friends; he had been promptly proclaimed a \ntraitor in the City itself; and the streets were barricaded with \ncarts and guarded by soldiers.  The Earl got back to his house by \nwater, with difficulty, and after an attempt to defend his house \nagainst the troops and cannon by which it was soon surrounded, gave \nhimself up that night.  He was brought to trial on the nineteenth, \nand found guilty; on the twenty-fifth, he was executed on Tower \nHill, where he died, at thirty-four years old, both courageously \nand penitently.  His step-father suffered with him.  His enemy, Sir \nWalter Raleigh, stood near the scaffold all the time - but not so \nnear it as we shall see him stand, before we finish his history.\n\nIn this case, as in the cases of the Duke of Norfolk and Mary Queen \nof Scots, the Queen had commanded, and countermanded, and again \ncommanded, the execution.  It is probable that the death of her \nyoung and gallant favourite in the prime of his good qualities, was \nnever off her mind afterwards, but she held out, the same vain, \nobstinate and capricious woman, for another year.  Then she danced \nbefore her Court on a state occasion - and cut, I should think, a \nmighty ridiculous figure, doing so in an immense ruff, stomacher \nand wig, at seventy years old.  For another year still, she held \nout, but, without any more dancing, and as a moody, sorrowful, \nbroken creature.  At last, on the tenth of March, one thousand six \nhundred and three, having been ill of a very bad cold, and made \nworse by the death of the Countess of Nottingham who was her \nintimate friend, she fell into a stupor and was supposed to be \ndead.  She recovered her consciousness, however, and then nothing \nwould induce her to go to bed; for she said that she knew that if \nshe did, she should never get up again.  There she lay for ten \ndays, on cushions on the floor, without any food, until the Lord \nAdmiral got her into bed at last, partly by persuasions and partly \nby main force.  When they asked her who should succeed her, she \nreplied that her seat had been the seat of Kings, and that she \nwould have for her successor, \'No rascal\'s son, but a King\'s.\'  \nUpon this, the lords present stared at one another, and took the \nliberty of asking whom she meant; to which she replied, \'Whom \nshould I mean, but our cousin of Scotland!\'  This was on the \ntwenty-third of March.  They asked her once again that day, after \nshe was speechless, whether she was still in the same mind?  She \nstruggled up in bed, and joined her hands over her head in the form \nof a crown, as the only reply she could make.  At three o\'clock \nnext morning, she very quietly died, in the forty-fifth year of her \nreign.\n\nThat reign had been a glorious one, and is made for ever memorable \nby the distinguished men who flourished in it.  Apart from the \ngreat voyagers, statesmen, and scholars, whom it produced, the \nnames of BACON, SPENSER, and SHAKESPEARE, will always be remembered \nwith pride and veneration by the civilised world, and will always \nimpart (though with no great reason, perhaps) some portion of their \nlustre to the name of Elizabeth herself.  It was a great reign for \ndiscovery, for commerce, and for English enterprise and spirit in \ngeneral.  It was a great reign for the Protestant religion and for \nthe Reformation which made England free.  The Queen was very \npopular, and in her progresses, or journeys about her dominions, \nwas everywhere received with the liveliest joy.  I think the truth \nis, that she was not half so good as she has been made out, and not \nhalf so bad as she has been made out.  She had her fine qualities, \nbut she was coarse, capricious, and treacherous, and had all the \nfaults of an excessively vain young woman long after she was an old \none.  On the whole, she had a great deal too much of her father in \nher, to please me.\n\nMany improvements and luxuries were introduced in the course of \nthese five-and-forty years in the general manner of living; but \ncock-fighting, bull-baiting, and bear-baiting, were still the \nnational amusements; and a coach was so rarely seen, and was such \nan ugly and cumbersome affair when it was seen, that even the Queen \nherself, on many high occasions, rode on horseback on a pillion \nbehind the Lord Chancellor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII - ENGLAND UNDER JAMES THE FIRST\n\n\n\n\'OUR cousin of Scotland\' was ugly, awkward, and shuffling both in \nmind and person.  His tongue was much too large for his mouth, his \nlegs were much too weak for his body, and his dull goggle-eyes \nstared and rolled like an idiot\'s.  He was cunning, covetous, \nwasteful, idle, drunken, greedy, dirty, cowardly, a great swearer, \nand the most conceited man on earth.  His figure - what is commonly \ncalled rickety from his birth - presented a most ridiculous \nappearance, dressed in thick padded clothes, as a safeguard against \nbeing stabbed (of which he lived in continual fear), of a grass-\ngreen colour from head to foot, with a hunting-horn dangling at his \nside instead of a sword, and his hat and feather sticking over one \neye, or hanging on the back of his head, as he happened to toss it \non.  He used to loll on the necks of his favourite courtiers, and \nslobber their faces, and kiss and pinch their cheeks; and the \ngreatest favourite he ever had, used to sign himself in his letters \nto his royal master, His Majesty\'s \'dog and slave,\' and used to \naddress his majesty as \'his Sowship.\'  His majesty was the worst \nrider ever seen, and thought himself the best.  He was one of the \nmost impertinent talkers (in the broadest Scotch) ever heard, and \nboasted of being unanswerable in all manner of argument.  He wrote \nsome of the most wearisome treatises ever read - among others, a \nbook upon witchcraft, in which he was a devout believer - and \nthought himself a prodigy of authorship.  He thought, and wrote, \nand said, that a king had a right to make and unmake what laws he \npleased, and ought to be accountable to nobody on earth.  This is \nthe plain, true character of the personage whom the greatest men \nabout the court praised and flattered to that degree, that I doubt \nif there be anything much more shameful in the annals of human \nnature.\n\nHe came to the English throne with great ease.  The miseries of a \ndisputed succession had been felt so long, and so dreadfully, that \nhe was proclaimed within a few hours of Elizabeth\'s death, and was \naccepted by the nation, even without being asked to give any pledge \nthat he would govern well, or that he would redress crying \ngrievances.  He took a month to come from Edinburgh to London; and, \nby way of exercising his new power, hanged a pickpocket on the \njourney without any trial, and knighted everybody he could lay hold \nof.  He made two hundred knights before he got to his palace in \nLondon, and seven hundred before he had been in it three months.  \nHe also shovelled sixty-two new peers into the House of Lords - and \nthere was a pretty large sprinkling of Scotchmen among them, you \nmay believe.\n\nHis Sowship\'s prime Minister, CECIL (for I cannot do better than \ncall his majesty what his favourite called him), was the enemy of \nSir Walter Raleigh, and also of Sir Walter\'s political friend, LORD \nCOBHAM; and his Sowship\'s first trouble was a plot originated by \nthese two, and entered into by some others, with the old object of \nseizing the King and keeping him in imprisonment until he should \nchange his ministers.  There were Catholic priests in the plot, and \nthere were Puritan noblemen too; for, although the Catholics and \nPuritans were strongly opposed to each other, they united at this \ntime against his Sowship, because they knew that he had a design \nagainst both, after pretending to be friendly to each; this design \nbeing to have only one high and convenient form of the Protestant \nreligion, which everybody should be bound to belong to, whether \nthey liked it or not.  This plot was mixed up with another, which \nmay or may not have had some reference to placing on the throne, at \nsome time, the LADY ARABELLA STUART; whose misfortune it was, to be \nthe daughter of the younger brother of his Sowship\'s father, but \nwho was quite innocent of any part in the scheme.  Sir Walter \nRaleigh was accused on the confession of Lord Cobham - a miserable \ncreature, who said one thing at one time, and another thing at \nanother time, and could be relied upon in nothing.  The trial of \nSir Walter Raleigh lasted from eight in the morning until nearly \nmidnight; he defended himself with such eloquence, genius, and \nspirit against all accusations, and against the insults of COKE, \nthe Attorney-General - who, according to the custom of the time, \nfoully abused him - that those who went there detesting the \nprisoner, came away admiring him, and declaring that anything so \nwonderful and so captivating was never heard.  He was found guilty, \nnevertheless, and sentenced to death.  Execution was deferred, and \nhe was taken to the Tower.  The two Catholic priests, less \nfortunate, were executed with the usual atrocity; and Lord Cobham \nand two others were pardoned on the scaffold.  His Sowship thought \nit wonderfully knowing in him to surprise the people by pardoning \nthese three at the very block; but, blundering, and bungling, as \nusual, he had very nearly overreached himself.  For, the messenger \non horseback who brought the pardon, came so late, that he was \npushed to the outside of the crowd, and was obliged to shout and \nroar out what he came for.  The miserable Cobham did not gain much \nby being spared that day.  He lived, both as a prisoner and a \nbeggar, utterly despised, and miserably poor, for thirteen years, \nand then died in an old outhouse belonging to one of his former \nservants.\n\nThis plot got rid of, and Sir Walter Raleigh safely shut up in the \nTower, his Sowship held a great dispute with the Puritans on their \npresenting a petition to him, and had it all his own way - not so \nvery wonderful, as he would talk continually, and would not hear \nanybody else - and filled the Bishops with admiration.  It was \ncomfortably settled that there was to be only one form of religion, \nand that all men were to think exactly alike.  But, although this \nwas arranged two centuries and a half ago, and although the \narrangement was supported by much fining and imprisonment, I do not \nfind that it is quite successful, even yet.\n\nHis Sowship, having that uncommonly high opinion of himself as a \nking, had a very low opinion of Parliament as a power that \naudaciously wanted to control him.  When he called his first \nParliament after he had been king a year, he accordingly thought he \nwould take pretty high ground with them, and told them that he \ncommanded them \'as an absolute king.\'  The Parliament thought those \nstrong words, and saw the necessity of upholding their authority.  \nHis Sowship had three children:  Prince Henry, Prince Charles, and \nthe Princess Elizabeth.  It would have been well for one of these, \nand we shall too soon see which, if he had learnt a little wisdom \nconcerning Parliaments from his father\'s obstinacy.\n\nNow, the people still labouring under their old dread of the \nCatholic religion, this Parliament revived and strengthened the \nsevere laws against it.  And this so angered ROBERT CATESBY, a \nrestless Catholic gentleman of an old family, that he formed one of \nthe most desperate and terrible designs ever conceived in the mind \nof man; no less a scheme than the Gunpowder Plot.\n\nHis object was, when the King, lords, and commons, should be \nassembled at the next opening of Parliament, to blow them up, one \nand all, with a great mine of gunpowder.  The first person to whom \nhe confided this horrible idea was THOMAS WINTER, a Worcestershire \ngentleman who had served in the army abroad, and had been secretly \nemployed in Catholic projects.  While Winter was yet undecided, and \nwhen he had gone over to the Netherlands, to learn from the Spanish \nAmbassador there whether there was any hope of Catholics being \nrelieved through the intercession of the King of Spain with his \nSowship, he found at Ostend a tall, dark, daring man, whom he had \nknown when they were both soldiers abroad, and whose name was GUIDO \n- or GUY - FAWKES.  Resolved to join the plot, he proposed it to \nthis man, knowing him to be the man for any desperate deed, and \nthey two came back to England together.  Here, they admitted two \nother conspirators; THOMAS PERCY, related to the Earl of \nNorthumberland, and JOHN WRIGHT, his brother-in-law.  All these met \ntogether in a solitary house in the open fields which were then \nnear Clement\'s Inn, now a closely blocked-up part of London; and \nwhen they had all taken a great oath of secrecy, Catesby told the \nrest what his plan was.  They then went up-stairs into a garret, \nand received the Sacrament from FATHER GERARD, a Jesuit, who is \nsaid not to have known actually of the Gunpowder Plot, but who, I \nthink, must have had his suspicions that there was something \ndesperate afoot.\n\nPercy was a Gentleman Pensioner, and as he had occasional duties to \nperform about the Court, then kept at Whitehall, there would be \nnothing suspicious in his living at Westminster.  So, having looked \nwell about him, and having found a house to let, the back of which \njoined the Parliament House, he hired it of a person named FERRIS, \nfor the purpose of undermining the wall.  Having got possession of \nthis house, the conspirators hired another on the Lambeth side of \nthe Thames, which they used as a storehouse for wood, gunpowder, \nand other combustible matters.  These were to be removed at night \n(and afterwards were removed), bit by bit, to the house at \nWestminster; and, that there might be some trusty person to keep \nwatch over the Lambeth stores, they admitted another conspirator, \nby name ROBERT KAY, a very poor Catholic gentleman.\n\nAll these arrangements had been made some months, and it was a \ndark, wintry, December night, when the conspirators, who had been \nin the meantime dispersed to avoid observation, met in the house at \nWestminster, and began to dig.  They had laid in a good stock of \neatables, to avoid going in and out, and they dug and dug with \ngreat ardour.  But, the wall being tremendously thick, and the work \nvery severe, they took into their plot CHRISTOPHER WRIGHT, a \nyounger brother of John Wright, that they might have a new pair of \nhands to help.  And Christopher Wright fell to like a fresh man, \nand they dug and dug by night and by day, and Fawkes stood sentinel \nall the time.  And if any man\'s heart seemed to fail him at all, \nFawkes said, \'Gentlemen, we have abundance of powder and shot here, \nand there is no fear of our being taken alive, even if discovered.\'  \nThe same Fawkes, who, in the capacity of sentinel, was always \nprowling about, soon picked up the intelligence that the King had \nprorogued the Parliament again, from the seventh of February, the \nday first fixed upon, until the third of October.  When the \nconspirators knew this, they agreed to separate until after the \nChristmas holidays, and to take no notice of each other in the \nmeanwhile, and never to write letters to one another on any \naccount.  So, the house in Westminster was shut up again, and I \nsuppose the neighbours thought that those strange-looking men who \nlived there so gloomily, and went out so seldom, were gone away to \nhave a merry Christmas somewhere.\n\nIt was the beginning of February, sixteen hundred and five, when \nCatesby met his fellow-conspirators again at this Westminster \nhouse.  He had now admitted three more; JOHN GRANT, a Warwickshire \ngentleman of a melancholy temper, who lived in a doleful house near \nStratford-upon-Avon, with a frowning wall all round it, and a deep \nmoat; ROBERT WINTER, eldest brother of Thomas; and Catesby\'s own \nservant, THOMAS BATES, who, Catesby thought, had had some suspicion \nof what his master was about.  These three had all suffered more or \nless for their religion in Elizabeth\'s time.  And now, they all \nbegan to dig again, and they dug and dug by night and by day.\n\nThey found it dismal work alone there, underground, with such a \nfearful secret on their minds, and so many murders before them.  \nThey were filled with wild fancies.  Sometimes, they thought they \nheard a great bell tolling, deep down in the earth under the \nParliament House; sometimes, they thought they heard low voices \nmuttering about the Gunpowder Plot; once in the morning, they \nreally did hear a great rumbling noise over their heads, as they \ndug and sweated in their mine.  Every man stopped and looked aghast \nat his neighbour, wondering what had happened, when that bold \nprowler, Fawkes, who had been out to look, came in and told them \nthat it was only a dealer in coals who had occupied a cellar under \nthe Parliament House, removing his stock in trade to some other \nplace.  Upon this, the conspirators, who with all their digging and \ndigging had not yet dug through the tremendously thick wall, \nchanged their plan; hired that cellar, which was directly under the \nHouse of Lords; put six-and-thirty barrels of gunpowder in it, and \ncovered them over with fagots and coals.  Then they all dispersed \nagain till September, when the following new conspirators were \nadmitted; SIR EDWARD BAYNHAM, of Gloucestershire; SIR EVERARD \nDIGBY, of Rutlandshire; AMBROSE ROOKWOOD, of Suffolk; FRANCIS \nTRESHAM, of Northamptonshire.  Most of these were rich, and were to \nassist the plot, some with money and some with horses on which the \nconspirators were to ride through the country and rouse the \nCatholics after the Parliament should be blown into air.\n\nParliament being again prorogued from the third of October to the \nfifth of November, and the conspirators being uneasy lest their \ndesign should have been found out, Thomas Winter said he would go \nup into the House of Lords on the day of the prorogation, and see \nhow matters looked.  Nothing could be better.  The unconscious \nCommissioners were walking about and talking to one another, just \nover the six-and-thirty barrels of gunpowder.  He came back and \ntold the rest so, and they went on with their preparations.  They \nhired a ship, and kept it ready in the Thames, in which Fawkes was \nto sail for Flanders after firing with a slow match the train that \nwas to explode the powder.  A number of Catholic gentlemen not in \nthe secret, were invited, on pretence of a hunting party, to meet \nSir Everard Digby at Dunchurch on the fatal day, that they might be \nready to act together.  And now all was ready.\n\nBut, now, the great wickedness and danger which had been all along \nat the bottom of this wicked plot, began to show itself.  As the \nfifth of November drew near, most of the conspirators, remembering \nthat they had friends and relations who would be in the House of \nLords that day, felt some natural relenting, and a wish to warn \nthem to keep away.  They were not much comforted by Catesby\'s \ndeclaring that in such a cause he would blow up his own son.  LORD \nMOUNTEAGLE, Tresham\'s brother-in-law, was certain to be in the \nhouse; and when Tresham found that he could not prevail upon the \nrest to devise any means of sparing their friends, he wrote a \nmysterious letter to this lord and left it at his lodging in the \ndusk, urging him to keep away from the opening of Parliament, \n\'since God and man had concurred to punish the wickedness of the \ntimes.\'  It contained the words \'that the Parliament should receive \na terrible blow, and yet should not see who hurt them.\'  And it \nadded, \'the danger is past, as soon as you have burnt the letter.\'\n\nThe ministers and courtiers made out that his Sowship, by a direct \nmiracle from Heaven, found out what this letter meant.  The truth \nis, that they were not long (as few men would be) in finding out \nfor themselves; and it was decided to let the conspirators alone, \nuntil the very day before the opening of Parliament.  That the \nconspirators had their fears, is certain; for, Tresham himself said \nbefore them all, that they were every one dead men; and, although \neven he did not take flight, there is reason to suppose that he had \nwarned other persons besides Lord Mounteagle.  However, they were \nall firm; and Fawkes, who was a man of iron, went down every day \nand night to keep watch in the cellar as usual.  He was there about \ntwo in the afternoon of the fourth, when the Lord Chamberlain and \nLord Mounteagle threw open the door and looked in.  \'Who are you, \nfriend?\' said they.  \'Why,\' said Fawkes, \'I am Mr. Percy\'s servant, \nand am looking after his store of fuel here.\'  \'Your master has \nlaid in a pretty good store,\' they returned, and shut the door, and \nwent away.  Fawkes, upon this, posted off to the other conspirators \nto tell them all was quiet, and went back and shut himself up in \nthe dark, black cellar again, where he heard the bell go twelve \no\'clock and usher in the fifth of November.  About two hours \nafterwards, he slowly opened the door, and came out to look about \nhim, in his old prowling way.  He was instantly seized and bound, \nby a party of soldiers under SIR THOMAS KNEVETT.  He had a watch \nupon him, some touchwood, some tinder, some slow matches; and there \nwas a dark lantern with a candle in it, lighted, behind the door.  \nHe had his boots and spurs on - to ride to the ship, I suppose - \nand it was well for the soldiers that they took him so suddenly.  \nIf they had left him but a moment\'s time to light a match, he \ncertainly would have tossed it in among the powder, and blown up \nhimself and them.\n\nThey took him to the King\'s bed-chamber first of all, and there the \nKing (causing him to be held very tight, and keeping a good way \noff), asked him how he could have the heart to intend to destroy so \nmany innocent people?  \'Because,\' said Guy Fawkes, \'desperate \ndiseases need desperate remedies.\'  To a little Scotch favourite, \nwith a face like a terrier, who asked him (with no particular \nwisdom) why he had collected so much gunpowder, he replied, because \nhe had meant to blow Scotchmen back to Scotland, and it would take \na deal of powder to do that.  Next day he was carried to the Tower, \nbut would make no confession.  Even after being horribly tortured, \nhe confessed nothing that the Government did not already know; \nthough he must have been in a fearful state - as his signature, \nstill preserved, in contrast with his natural hand-writing before \nhe was put upon the dreadful rack, most frightfully shows.  Bates, \na very different man, soon said the Jesuits had had to do with the \nplot, and probably, under the torture, would as readily have said \nanything.  Tresham, taken and put in the Tower too, made \nconfessions and unmade them, and died of an illness that was heavy \nupon him.  Rookwood, who had stationed relays of his own horses all \nthe way to Dunchurch, did not mount to escape until the middle of \nthe day, when the news of the plot was all over London.  On the \nroad, he came up with the two Wrights, Catesby, and Percy; and they \nall galloped together into Northamptonshire.  Thence to Dunchurch, \nwhere they found the proposed party assembled.  Finding, however, \nthat there had been a plot, and that it had been discovered, the \nparty disappeared in the course of the night, and left them alone \nwith Sir Everard Digby.  Away they all rode again, through \nWarwickshire and Worcestershire, to a house called Holbeach, on the \nborders of Staffordshire.  They tried to raise the Catholics on \ntheir way, but were indignantly driven off by them.  All this time \nthey were hotly pursued by the sheriff of Worcester, and a fast \nincreasing concourse of riders.  At last, resolving to defend \nthemselves at Holbeach, they shut themselves up in the house, and \nput some wet powder before the fire to dry.  But it blew up, and \nCatesby was singed and blackened, and almost killed, and some of \nthe others were sadly hurt.  Still, knowing that they must die, \nthey resolved to die there, and with only their swords in their \nhands appeared at the windows to be shot at by the sheriff and his \nassistants.  Catesby said to Thomas Winter, after Thomas had been \nhit in the right arm which dropped powerless by his side, \'Stand by \nme, Tom, and we will die together!\' - which they did, being shot \nthrough the body by two bullets from one gun.  John Wright, and \nChristopher Wright, and Percy, were also shot.  Rookwood and Digby \nwere taken:  the former with a broken arm and a wound in his body \ntoo.\n\nIt was the fifteenth of January, before the trial of Guy Fawkes, \nand such of the other conspirators as were left alive, came on.  \nThey were all found guilty, all hanged, drawn, and quartered:  \nsome, in St. Paul\'s Churchyard, on the top of Ludgate-hill; some, \nbefore the Parliament House.  A Jesuit priest, named HENRY GARNET, \nto whom the dreadful design was said to have been communicated, was \ntaken and tried; and two of his servants, as well as a poor priest \nwho was taken with him, were tortured without mercy.  He himself \nwas not tortured, but was surrounded in the Tower by tamperers and \ntraitors, and so was made unfairly to convict himself out of his \nown mouth.  He said, upon his trial, that he had done all he could \nto prevent the deed, and that he could not make public what had \nbeen told him in confession - though I am afraid he knew of the \nplot in other ways.  He was found guilty and executed, after a \nmanful defence, and the Catholic Church made a saint of him; some \nrich and powerful persons, who had had nothing to do with the \nproject, were fined and imprisoned for it by the Star Chamber; the \nCatholics, in general, who had recoiled with horror from the idea \nof the infernal contrivance, were unjustly put under more severe \nlaws than before; and this was the end of the Gunpowder Plot.\n\n\nSECOND PART\n\n\nHis Sowship would pretty willingly, I think, have blown the House \nof Commons into the air himself; for, his dread and jealousy of it \nknew no bounds all through his reign.  When he was hard pressed for \nmoney he was obliged to order it to meet, as he could get no money \nwithout it; and when it asked him first to abolish some of the \nmonopolies in necessaries of life which were a great grievance to \nthe people, and to redress other public wrongs, he flew into a rage \nand got rid of it again.  At one time he wanted it to consent to \nthe Union of England with Scotland, and quarrelled about that.  At \nanother time it wanted him to put down a most infamous Church \nabuse, called the High Commission Court, and he quarrelled with it \nabout that.  At another time it entreated him not to be quite so \nfond of his archbishops and bishops who made speeches in his praise \ntoo awful to be related, but to have some little consideration for \nthe poor Puritan clergy who were persecuted for preaching in their \nown way, and not according to the archbishops and bishops; and they \nquarrelled about that.  In short, what with hating the House of \nCommons, and pretending not to hate it; and what with now sending \nsome of its members who opposed him, to Newgate or to the Tower, \nand now telling the rest that they must not presume to make \nspeeches about the public affairs which could not possibly concern \nthem; and what with cajoling, and bullying, and fighting, and being \nfrightened; the House of Commons was the plague of his Sowship\'s \nexistence.  It was pretty firm, however, in maintaining its rights, \nand insisting that the Parliament should make the laws, and not the \nKing by his own single proclamations (which he tried hard to do); \nand his Sowship was so often distressed for money, in consequence, \nthat he sold every sort of title and public office as if they were \nmerchandise, and even invented a new dignity called a Baronetcy, \nwhich anybody could buy for a thousand pounds.\n\nThese disputes with his Parliaments, and his hunting, and his \ndrinking, and his lying in bed - for he was a great sluggard - \noccupied his Sowship pretty well.  The rest of his time he chiefly \npassed in hugging and slobbering his favourites.  The first of \nthese was SIR PHILIP HERBERT, who had no knowledge whatever, except \nof dogs, and horses, and hunting, but whom he soon made EARL OF \nMONTGOMERY.  The next, and a much more famous one, was ROBERT CARR, \nor KER (for it is not certain which was his right name), who came \nfrom the Border country, and whom he soon made VISCOUNT ROCHESTER, \nand afterwards, EARL OF SOMERSET.  The way in which his Sowship \ndoted on this handsome young man, is even more odious to think of, \nthan the way in which the really great men of England condescended \nto bow down before him.  The favourite\'s great friend was a certain \nSIR THOMAS OVERBURY, who wrote his love-letters for him, and \nassisted him in the duties of his many high places, which his own \nignorance prevented him from discharging.  But this same Sir Thomas \nhaving just manhood enough to dissuade the favourite from a wicked \nmarriage with the beautiful Countess of Essex, who was to get a \ndivorce from her husband for the purpose, the said Countess, in her \nrage, got Sir Thomas put into the Tower, and there poisoned him.  \nThen the favourite and this bad woman were publicly married by the \nKing\'s pet bishop, with as much to-do and rejoicing, as if he had \nbeen the best man, and she the best woman, upon the face of the \nearth.\n\nBut, after a longer sunshine than might have been expected - of \nseven years or so, that is to say - another handsome young man \nstarted up and eclipsed the EARL OF SOMERSET.  This was GEORGE \nVILLIERS, the youngest son of a Leicestershire gentleman:  who came \nto Court with all the Paris fashions on him, and could dance as \nwell as the best mountebank that ever was seen.  He soon danced \nhimself into the good graces of his Sowship, and danced the other \nfavourite out of favour.  Then, it was all at once discovered that \nthe Earl and Countess of Somerset had not deserved all those great \npromotions and mighty rejoicings, and they were separately tried \nfor the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, and for other crimes.  But, \nthe King was so afraid of his late favourite\'s publicly telling \nsome disgraceful things he knew of him - which he darkly threatened \nto do - that he was even examined with two men standing, one on \neither side of him, each with a cloak in his hand, ready to throw \nit over his head and stop his mouth if he should break out with \nwhat he had it in his power to tell.  So, a very lame affair was \npurposely made of the trial, and his punishment was an allowance of \nfour thousand pounds a year in retirement, while the Countess was \npardoned, and allowed to pass into retirement too.  They hated one \nanother by this time, and lived to revile and torment each other \nsome years.\n\nWhile these events were in progress, and while his Sowship was \nmaking such an exhibition of himself, from day to day and from year \nto year, as is not often seen in any sty, three remarkable deaths \ntook place in England.  The first was that of the Minister, Robert \nCecil, Earl of Salisbury, who was past sixty, and had never been \nstrong, being deformed from his birth.  He said at last that he had \nno wish to live; and no Minister need have had, with his experience \nof the meanness and wickedness of those disgraceful times.  The \nsecond was that of the Lady Arabella Stuart, who alarmed his \nSowship mightily, by privately marrying WILLIAM SEYMOUR, son of \nLORD BEAUCHAMP, who was a descendant of King Henry the Seventh, and \nwho, his Sowship thought, might consequently increase and \nstrengthen any claim she might one day set up to the throne.  She \nwas separated from her husband (who was put in the Tower) and \nthrust into a boat to be confined at Durham.  She escaped in a \nman\'s dress to get away in a French ship from Gravesend to France, \nbut unhappily missed her husband, who had escaped too, and was soon \ntaken.  She went raving mad in the miserable Tower, and died there \nafter four years.  The last, and the most important of these three \ndeaths, was that of Prince Henry, the heir to the throne, in the \nnineteenth year of his age.  He was a promising young prince, and \ngreatly liked; a quiet, well-conducted youth, of whom two very good \nthings are known:  first, that his father was jealous of him; \nsecondly, that he was the friend of Sir Walter Raleigh, languishing \nthrough all those years in the Tower, and often said that no man \nbut his father would keep such a bird in such a cage.  On the \noccasion of the preparations for the marriage of his sister the \nPrincess Elizabeth with a foreign prince (and an unhappy marriage \nit turned out), he came from Richmond, where he had been very ill, \nto greet his new brother-in-law, at the palace at Whitehall.  There \nhe played a great game at tennis, in his shirt, though it was very \ncold weather, and was seized with an alarming illness, and died \nwithin a fortnight of a putrid fever.  For this young prince Sir \nWalter Raleigh wrote, in his prison in the Tower, the beginning of \na History of the World:  a wonderful instance how little his \nSowship could do to confine a great man\'s mind, however long he \nmight imprison his body.\n\nAnd this mention of Sir Walter Raleigh, who had many faults, but \nwho never showed so many merits as in trouble and adversity, may \nbring me at once to the end of his sad story.  After an \nimprisonment in the Tower of twelve long years, he proposed to \nresume those old sea voyages of his, and to go to South America in \nsearch of gold.  His Sowship, divided between his wish to be on \ngood terms with the Spaniards through whose territory Sir Walter \nmust pass (he had long had an idea of marrying Prince Henry to a \nSpanish Princess), and his avaricious eagerness to get hold of the \ngold, did not know what to do.  But, in the end, he set Sir Walter \nfree, taking securities for his return; and Sir Walter fitted out \nan expedition at his own coast and, on the twenty-eighth of March, \none thousand six hundred and seventeen, sailed away in command of \none of its ships, which he ominously called the Destiny.  The \nexpedition failed; the common men, not finding the gold they had \nexpected, mutinied; a quarrel broke out between Sir Walter and the \nSpaniards, who hated him for old successes of his against them; and \nhe took and burnt a little town called SAINT THOMAS.  For this he \nwas denounced to his Sowship by the Spanish Ambassador as a pirate; \nand returning almost broken-hearted, with his hopes and fortunes \nshattered, his company of friends dispersed, and his brave son (who \nhad been one of them) killed, he was taken - through the treachery \nof SIR LEWIS STUKELY, his near relation, a scoundrel and a Vice-\nAdmiral - and was once again immured in his prison-home of so many \nyears.\n\nHis Sowship being mightily disappointed in not getting any gold, \nSir Walter Raleigh was tried as unfairly, and with as many lies and \nevasions as the judges and law officers and every other authority \nin Church and State habitually practised under such a King.  After \na great deal of prevarication on all parts but his own, it was \ndeclared that he must die under his former sentence, now fifteen \nyears old.  So, on the twenty-eighth of October, one thousand six \nhundred and eighteen, he was shut up in the Gate House at \nWestminster to pass his late night on earth, and there he took \nleave of his good and faithful lady who was worthy to have lived in \nbetter days.  At eight o\'clock next morning, after a cheerful \nbreakfast, and a pipe, and a cup of good wine, he was taken to Old \nPalace Yard in Westminster, where the scaffold was set up, and \nwhere so many people of high degree were assembled to see him die, \nthat it was a matter of some difficulty to get him through the \ncrowd.  He behaved most nobly, but if anything lay heavy on his \nmind, it was that Earl of Essex, whose head he had seen roll off; \nand he solemnly said that he had had no hand in bringing him to the \nblock, and that he had shed tears for him when he died.  As the \nmorning was very cold, the Sheriff said, would he come down to a \nfire for a little space, and warm himself?  But Sir Walter thanked \nhim, and said no, he would rather it were done at once, for he was \nill of fever and ague, and in another quarter of an hour his \nshaking fit would come upon him if he were still alive, and his \nenemies might then suppose that he trembled for fear.  With that, \nhe kneeled and made a very beautiful and Christian prayer.  Before \nhe laid his head upon the block he felt the edge of the axe, and \nsaid, with a smile upon his face, that it was a sharp medicine, but \nwould cure the worst disease.  When he was bent down ready for \ndeath, he said to the executioner, finding that he hesitated, \'What \ndost thou fear?  Strike, man!\'  So, the axe came down and struck \nhis head off, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.\n\nThe new favourite got on fast.  He was made a viscount, he was made \nDuke of Buckingham, he was made a marquis, he was made Master of \nthe Horse, he was made Lord High Admiral - and the Chief Commander \nof the gallant English forces that had dispersed the Spanish \nArmada, was displaced to make room for him.  He had the whole \nkingdom at his disposal, and his mother sold all the profits and \nhonours of the State, as if she had kept a shop.  He blazed all \nover with diamonds and other precious stones, from his hatband and \nhis earrings to his shoes.  Yet he was an ignorant presumptuous, \nswaggering compound of knave and fool, with nothing but his beauty \nand his dancing to recommend him.  This is the gentleman who called \nhimself his Majesty\'s dog and slave, and called his Majesty Your \nSowship.  His Sowship called him STEENIE; it is supposed, because \nthat was a nickname for Stephen, and because St. Stephen was \ngenerally represented in pictures as a handsome saint.\n\nHis Sowship was driven sometimes to his wits\'-end by his trimming \nbetween the general dislike of the Catholic religion at home, and \nhis desire to wheedle and flatter it abroad, as his only means of \ngetting a rich princess for his son\'s wife:  a part of whose \nfortune he might cram into his greasy pockets.  Prince Charles - or \nas his Sowship called him, Baby Charles - being now PRINCE OF \nWALES, the old project of a marriage with the Spanish King\'s \ndaughter had been revived for him; and as she could not marry a \nProtestant without leave from the Pope, his Sowship himself \nsecretly and meanly wrote to his Infallibility, asking for it.  The \nnegotiation for this Spanish marriage takes up a larger space in \ngreat books, than you can imagine, but the upshot of it all is, \nthat when it had been held off by the Spanish Court for a long \ntime, Baby Charles and Steenie set off in disguise as Mr. Thomas \nSmith and Mr. John Smith, to see the Spanish Princess; that Baby \nCharles pretended to be desperately in love with her, and jumped \noff walls to look at her, and made a considerable fool of himself \nin a good many ways; that she was called Princess of Wales and that \nthe whole Spanish Court believed Baby Charles to be all but dying \nfor her sake, as he expressly told them he was; that Baby Charles \nand Steenie came back to England, and were received with as much \nrapture as if they had been a blessing to it; that Baby Charles had \nactually fallen in love with HENRIETTA MARIA, the French King\'s \nsister, whom he had seen in Paris; that he thought it a wonderfully \nfine and princely thing to have deceived the Spaniards, all \nthrough; and that he openly said, with a chuckle, as soon as he was \nsafe and sound at home again, that the Spaniards were great fools \nto have believed him.\n\nLike most dishonest men, the Prince and the favourite complained \nthat the people whom they had deluded were dishonest.  They made \nsuch misrepresentations of the treachery of the Spaniards in this \nbusiness of the Spanish match, that the English nation became eager \nfor a war with them.  Although the gravest Spaniards laughed at the \nidea of his Sowship in a warlike attitude, the Parliament granted \nmoney for the beginning of hostilities, and the treaties with Spain \nwere publicly declared to be at an end.  The Spanish ambassador in \nLondon - probably with the help of the fallen favourite, the Earl \nof Somerset - being unable to obtain speech with his Sowship, \nslipped a paper into his hand, declaring that he was a prisoner in \nhis own house, and was entirely governed by Buckingham and his \ncreatures.  The first effect of this letter was that his Sowship \nbegan to cry and whine, and took Baby Charles away from Steenie, \nand went down to Windsor, gabbling all sorts of nonsense.  The end \nof it was that his Sowship hugged his dog and slave, and said he \nwas quite satisfied.\n\nHe had given the Prince and the favourite almost unlimited power to \nsettle anything with the Pope as to the Spanish marriage; and he \nnow, with a view to the French one, signed a treaty that all Roman \nCatholics in England should exercise their religion freely, and \nshould never be required to take any oath contrary thereto.  In \nreturn for this, and for other concessions much less to be \ndefended, Henrietta Maria was to become the Prince\'s wife, and was \nto bring him a fortune of eight hundred thousand crowns.\n\nHis Sowship\'s eyes were getting red with eagerly looking for the \nmoney, when the end of a gluttonous life came upon him; and, after \na fortnight\'s illness, on Sunday the twenty-seventh of March, one \nthousand six hundred and twenty-five, he died.  He had reigned \ntwenty-two years, and was fifty-nine years old.  I know of nothing \nmore abominable in history than the adulation that was lavished on \nthis King, and the vice and corruption that such a barefaced habit \nof lying produced in his court.  It is much to be doubted whether \none man of honour, and not utterly self-disgraced, kept his place \nnear James the First.  Lord Bacon, that able and wise philosopher, \nas the First Judge in the Kingdom in this reign, became a public \nspectacle of dishonesty and corruption; and in his base flattery of \nhis Sowship, and in his crawling servility to his dog and slave, \ndisgraced himself even more.  But, a creature like his Sowship set \nupon a throne is like the Plague, and everybody receives infection \nfrom him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII - ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE FIRST\n\n\n\nBABY CHARLES became KING CHARLES THE FIRST, in the twenty-fifth \nyear of his age.  Unlike his father, he was usually amiable in his \nprivate character, and grave and dignified in his bearing; but, \nlike his father, he had monstrously exaggerated notions of the \nrights of a king, and was evasive, and not to be trusted.  If his \nword could have been relied upon, his history might have had a \ndifferent end.\n\nHis first care was to send over that insolent upstart, Buckingham, \nto bring Henrietta Maria from Paris to be his Queen; upon which \noccasion Buckingham - with his usual audacity - made love to the \nyoung Queen of Austria, and was very indignant indeed with CARDINAL \nRICHELIEU, the French Minister, for thwarting his intentions.  The \nEnglish people were very well disposed to like their new Queen, and \nto receive her with great favour when she came among them as a \nstranger.  But, she held the Protestant religion in great dislike, \nand brought over a crowd of unpleasant priests, who made her do \nsome very ridiculous things, and forced themselves upon the public \nnotice in many disagreeable ways.  Hence, the people soon came to \ndislike her, and she soon came to dislike them; and she did so much \nall through this reign in setting the King (who was dotingly fond \nof her) against his subjects, that it would have been better for \nhim if she had never been born.\n\nNow, you are to understand that King Charles the First - of his own \ndetermination to be a high and mighty King not to be called to \naccount by anybody, and urged on by his Queen besides - \ndeliberately set himself to put his Parliament down and to put \nhimself up. You are also to understand, that even in pursuit of \nthis wrong idea (enough in itself to have ruined any king) he never \ntook a straight course, but always took a crooked one.\n\nHe was bent upon war with Spain, though neither the House of \nCommons nor the people were quite clear as to the justice of that \nwar, now that they began to think a little more about the story of \nthe Spanish match.  But the King rushed into it hotly, raised money \nby illegal means to meet its expenses, and encountered a miserable \nfailure at Cadiz, in the very first year of his reign.  An \nexpedition to Cadiz had been made in the hope of plunder, but as it \nwas not successful, it was necessary to get a grant of money from \nthe Parliament; and when they met, in no very complying humour, \nthe, King told them, \'to make haste to let him have it, or it would \nbe the worse for themselves.\'  Not put in a more complying humour \nby this, they impeached the King\'s favourite, the Duke of \nBuckingham, as the cause (which he undoubtedly was) of many great \npublic grievances and wrongs.  The King, to save him, dissolved the \nParliament without getting the money he wanted; and when the Lords \nimplored him to consider and grant a little delay, he replied, \'No, \nnot one minute.\'  He then began to raise money for himself by the \nfollowing means among others.\n\nHe levied certain duties called tonnage and poundage which had not \nbeen granted by the Parliament, and could lawfully be levied by no \nother power; he called upon the seaport towns to furnish, and to \npay all the cost for three months of, a fleet of armed ships; and \nhe required the people to unite in lending him large sums of money, \nthe repayment of which was very doubtful.  If the poor people \nrefused, they were pressed as soldiers or sailors; if the gentry \nrefused, they were sent to prison.  Five gentlemen, named SIR \nTHOMAS DARNEL, JOHN CORBET, WALTER EARL, JOHN HEVENINGHAM, and \nEVERARD HAMPDEN, for refusing were taken up by a warrant of the \nKing\'s privy council, and were sent to prison without any cause but \nthe King\'s pleasure being stated for their imprisonment.  Then the \nquestion came to be solemnly tried, whether this was not a \nviolation of Magna Charta, and an encroachment by the King on the \nhighest rights of the English people.  His lawyers contended No, \nbecause to encroach upon the rights of the English people would be \nto do wrong, and the King could do no wrong.  The accommodating \njudges decided in favour of this wicked nonsense; and here was a \nfatal division between the King and the people.\n\nFor all this, it became necessary to call another Parliament.  The \npeople, sensible of the danger in which their liberties were, chose \nfor it those who were best known for their determined opposition to \nthe King; but still the King, quite blinded by his determination to \ncarry everything before him, addressed them when they met, in a \ncontemptuous manner, and just told them in so many words that he \nhad only called them together because he wanted money.  The \nParliament, strong enough and resolute enough to know that they \nwould lower his tone, cared little for what he said, and laid \nbefore him one of the great documents of history, which is called \nthe PETITION OF RIGHT, requiring that the free men of England \nshould no longer be called upon to lend the King money, and should \nno longer be pressed or imprisoned for refusing to do so; further, \nthat the free men of England should no longer be seized by the \nKing\'s special mandate or warrant, it being contrary to their \nrights and liberties and the laws of their country.  At first the \nKing returned an answer to this petition, in which he tried to \nshirk it altogether; but, the House of Commons then showing their \ndetermination to go on with the impeachment of Buckingham, the King \nin alarm returned an answer, giving his consent to all that was \nrequired of him.  He not only afterwards departed from his word and \nhonour on these points, over and over again, but, at this very \ntime, he did the mean and dissembling act of publishing his first \nanswer and not his second - merely that the people might suppose \nthat the Parliament had not got the better of him.\n\nThat pestilent Buckingham, to gratify his own wounded vanity, had \nby this time involved the country in war with France, as well as \nwith Spain.  For such miserable causes and such miserable creatures \nare wars sometimes made!  But he was destined to do little more \nmischief in this world.  One morning, as he was going out of his \nhouse to his carriage, he turned to speak to a certain Colonel \nFRYER who was with him; and he was violently stabbed with a knife, \nwhich the murderer left sticking in his heart.  This happened in \nhis hall.  He had had angry words up-stairs, just before, with some \nFrench gentlemen, who were immediately suspected by his servants, \nand had a close escape from being set upon and killed.  In the \nmidst of the noise, the real murderer, who had gone to the kitchen \nand might easily have got away, drew his sword and cried out, \'I am \nthe man!\'  His name was JOHN FELTON, a Protestant and a retired \nofficer in the army.  He said he had had no personal ill-will to \nthe Duke, but had killed him as a curse to the country.  He had \naimed his blow well, for Buckingham had only had time to cry out, \n\'Villain!\' and then he drew out the knife, fell against a table, \nand died.\n\nThe council made a mighty business of examining John Felton about \nthis murder, though it was a plain case enough, one would think.  \nHe had come seventy miles to do it, he told them, and he did it for \nthe reason he had declared; if they put him upon the rack, as that \nnoble MARQUIS OF DORSET whom he saw before him, had the goodness to \nthreaten, he gave that marquis warning, that he would accuse HIM as \nhis accomplice!  The King was unpleasantly anxious to have him \nracked, nevertheless; but as the judges now found out that torture \nwas contrary to the law of England - it is a pity they did not make \nthe discovery a little sooner - John Felton was simply executed for \nthe murder he had done.  A murder it undoubtedly was, and not in \nthe least to be defended:  though he had freed England from one of \nthe most profligate, contemptible, and base court favourites to \nwhom it has ever yielded.\n\nA very different man now arose.  This was SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH, a \nYorkshire gentleman, who had sat in Parliament for a long time, and \nwho had favoured arbitrary and haughty principles, but who had gone \nover to the people\'s side on receiving offence from Buckingham.  \nThe King, much wanting such a man - for, besides being naturally \nfavourable to the King\'s cause, he had great abilities - made him \nfirst a Baron, and then a Viscount, and gave him high employment, \nand won him most completely.\n\nA Parliament, however, was still in existence, and was NOT to be \nwon.";
