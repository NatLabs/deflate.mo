The\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\nfiles per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach 80 billion Etexts.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\n\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/BU\":  and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

They are England and Scotland, and Ireland.  England and \nScotland form the greater part of these Islands.  Ireland is the \nnext in size.  The little neighbouring islands, which are so small \nupon the Map as to be mere dots, are chiefly little bits of \nScotland, - broken off, I dare say, in the course of a great length \nof time, by the power of the restless water.\n\nIn the old days, a long, long while ago, before Our Saviour was \nborn on earth and lay asleep in a manger, these Islands were in the \nsame place, and the stormy sea roared round them, just as it roars \nnow.  But the sea was not alive, then, with great ships and brave \nsailors, sailing to and from all parts of the world.  It was very \nlonely.  The Islands lay solitary, in the great expanse of water.  \nThe foaming waves dashed against their cliffs, and the bleak winds \nblew over their forests; but the winds and waves brought no \nadventurers to land upon the Islands, and the savage Islanders knew \nnothing of the rest of the world, and the rest of the world knew \nnothing of them.\n\nIt is supposed that the Phoenicians, who were an ancient people, \nfamous for carrying on trade, came in ships to these Islands, and \nfound that they produced tin and lead; both very useful things, as \nyou know, and both produced to this very hour upon the sea-coast. \nThe most celebrated tin mines in Cornwall are, still, close to the \nsea.  One of them, which I have seen, is so close to it that it is \nhollowed out underneath the ocean; and the miners say, that in \nstormy weather, when they are at work down in that deep place, they \ncan hear the noise of the waves thundering above their heads.  So, \nthe Phoenicians, coasting about the Islands, would come, without \nmuch difficulty, to where the tin and lead were.\n\nThe Phoenicians traded with the Islanders for these metals, and \ngave the Islanders some other useful things in exchange.  The \nIslanders were, at first, poor savages, going almost naked, or only \ndressed in the rough skins of beasts, and staining their bodies, as \nother savages do, with coloured earths and the juices of plants.  \nBut the Phoenicians, sailing over to the opposite coasts of France \nand Belgium, and saying to the people there, \'We have been to those \nwhite cliffs across the water, which you can see in fine weather, \nand from that country, which is called BRITAIN, we bring this tin \nand lead,\' tempted some of the French and Belgians to come over \nalso.  These people settled themselves on the south coast of \nEngland, which is now called Kent; and, although they were a rough \npeople too, they taught the savage Britons some useful arts, and \nimproved that part of the Islands.  It is probable that other \npeople came over from Spain to Ireland, and settled there.\n\nThus, by little and little, strangers became mixed with the \nIslanders, and the savage Britons grew into a wild, bold people; \nalmost savage, still, especially in the interior of the country \naway from the sea where the foreign settlers seldom went; but \nhardy, brave, and strong.\n\nThe whole country was covered with forests, and swamps.  The \ngreater part of it was very misty and cold.  There were no roads, \nno bridges, no streets, no houses that you would think deserving of \nthe name.  A town was nothing but a collection of straw-covered \nhuts, hidden in a thick wood, with a ditch all round, and a low \nwall, made of mud, or the trunks of trees placed one upon another.  \nThe people planted little or no corn, but lived upon the flesh of \ntheir flocks and cattle.  They made no coins, but used metal rings \nfor money.  They were clever in basket-work, as savage people often \nare; and they could make a coarse kind of cloth, and some very bad \nearthenware.  But in building fortresses they were much more \nclever.\n\nThey made boats of basket-work, covered with the skins of animals, \nbut seldom, if ever, ventured far from the shore.  They made \nswords, of copper mixed with tin; but, these swords were of an \nawkward shape, and so soft that a heavy blow would bend one.  They \nmade light shields, short pointed daggers, and spears - which they \njerked back after they had thrown them at an enemy, by a long strip \nof leather fastened to the stem.  The butt-end was a rattle, to \nfrighten an enemy\'s horse.  The ancient Britons, being divided into \nas many as thirty or forty tribes, each commanded by its own little \nking, were constantly fighting with one another, as savage people \nusually do; and they always fought with these weapons.\n\nThey were very fond of horses.  The standard of Kent was the \npicture of a white horse.  They could break them in and manage them \nwonderfully well.  Indeed, the horses (of which they had an \nabundance, though they were rather small) were so well taught in \nthose days, that they can scarcely be said to have improved since; \nthough the men are so much wiser.  They understood, and obeyed, \nevery word of command; and would stand still by themselves, in all \nthe din and noise of battle, while their masters went to fight on \nfoot.  The Britons could not have succeeded in their most \nremarkable art, without the aid of these sensible and trusty \nanimals.  The art I mean, is the construction and management of \nwar-chariots or cars, for which they have ever been celebrated in \nhistory.  Each of the best sort of these chariots, not quite breast \nhigh in front, and open at the back, contained one man to drive, \nand two or three others to fight - all standing up.  The horses who \ndrew them were so well trained, that they would tear, at full \ngallop, over the most stony ways, and even through the woods; \ndashing down their masters\' enemies beneath their hoofs, and \ncutting them to pieces with the blades of swords, or scythes, which \nwere fastened to the wheels, and stretched out beyond the car on \neach side, for that cruel purpose.  In a moment, while at full \nspeed, the horses would stop, at the driver\'s command.  The men \nwithin would leap out, deal blows about them with their swords like \nhail, leap on the horses, on the pole, spring back into the \nchariots anyhow; and, as soon as they were safe, the horses tore \naway again.\n\nThe Britons had a strange and terrible religion, called the \nReligion of the Druids.  It seems to have been brought over, in \nvery early times indeed, from the opposite country of France, \nanciently called Gaul, and to have mixed up the worship of the \nSerpent, and of the Sun and Moon, with the worship of some of the \nHeathen Gods and Goddesses.  Most of its ceremonies were kept \nsecret by the priests, the Druids, who pretended to be enchanters, \nand who carried magicians\' wands, and wore, each of them, about his \nneck, what he told the ignorant people was a Serpent\'s egg in a \ngolden case.  But it is certain that the Druidical ceremonies \nincluded the sacrifice of human victims, the torture of some \nsuspected criminals, and, on particular occasions, even the burning \nalive, in immense wicker cages, of a number of men and animals \ntogether.  The Druid Priests had some kind of veneration for the \nOak, and for the mistletoe - the same plant that we hang up in \nhouses at Christmas Time now - when its white berries grew upon the \nOak.  They met together in dark woods, which they called Sacred \nGroves; and there they instructed, in their mysterious arts, young \nmen who came to them as pupils, and who sometimes stayed with them \nas long as twenty years.\n\nThese Druids built great Temples and altars, open to the sky, \nfragments of some of which are yet remaining.  Stonehenge, on \nSalisbury Plain, in Wiltshire, is the most extraordinary of these.  \nThree curious stones, called Kits Coty House, on Bluebell Hill, \nnear Maidstone, in Kent, form another.  We know, from examination \nof the great blocks of which such buildings are made, that they \ncould not have been raised without the aid of some ingenious \nmachines, which are common now, but which the ancient Britons \ncertainly did not use in making their own uncomfortable houses.  I \nshould not wonder if the Druids, and their pupils who stayed with \nthem twenty years, knowing more than the rest of the Britons, kept \nthe people out of sight while they made these buildings, and then \npretended that they built them by magic.  Perhaps they had a hand \nin the fortresses too; at all events, as they were very powerful, \nand very much believed in, and as they made and executed the laws, \nand paid no taxes, I don\'t wonder that they liked their trade.  \nAnd, as they persuaded the people the more Druids there were, the \nbetter off the people would be, I don\'t wonder that there were a \ngood many of them.  But it is pleasant to think that there are no \nDruids, NOW, who go on in that way, and pretend to carry \nEnchanters\' Wands and Serpents\' Eggs - and of course there is \nnothing of the kind, anywhere.\n\nSuch was the improved condition of the ancient Britons, fifty-five \nyears before the birth of Our Saviour, when the Romans, under their \ngreat General, Julius Caesar, were masters of all the rest of the \nknown world.  Julius Caesar had then just conquered Gaul; and \nhearing, in Gaul, a good deal about the opposite Island with the \nwhite cliffs, and about the bravery of the Britons who inhabited it \n- some of whom had been fetched over to help the Gauls in the war \nagainst him - he resolved, as he was so near, to come and conquer \nBritain next.\n\nSo, Julius Caesar came sailing over to this Island of ours, with \neighty vessels and twelve thousand men.  And he came from the \nFrench coast between Calais and Boulogne, \'because thence was the \nshortest passage into Britain;\' just for the same reason as our \nsteam-boats now take the same track, every day.  He expected to \nconquer Britain easily:  but it was not such easy work as he \nsupposed - for the bold Britons fought most bravely; and, what with \nnot having his horse-soldiers with him (for they had been driven \nback by a storm), and what with having some of his vessels dashed \nto pieces by a high tide after they were drawn ashore, he ran great \nrisk of being totally defeated.  However, for once that the bold \nBritons beat him, he beat them twice; though not so soundly but \nthat he was very glad to accept their proposals of peace, and go \naway.\n\nBut, in the spring of the next year, he came back; this time, with \neight hundred vessels and thirty thousand men.  The British tribes \nchose, as their general-in-chief, a Briton, whom the Romans in \ntheir Latin language called CASSIVELLAUNUS, but whose British name \nis supposed to have been CASWALLON.  A brave general he was, and \nwell he and his soldiers fought the Roman army!  So well, that \nwhenever in that war the Roman soldiers saw a great cloud of dust, \nand heard the rattle of the rapid British chariots, they trembled \nin their hearts.  Besides a number of smaller battles, there was a \nbattle fought near Canterbury, in Kent; there was a battle fought \nnear Chertsey, in Surrey; there was a battle fought near a marshy \nlittle town in a wood, the capital of that part of Britain which \nbelonged to CASSIVELLAUNUS, and which was probably near what is now \nSaint Albans, in Hertfordshire.  However, brave CASSIVELLAUNUS had \nthe worst of it, on the whole; though he and his men always fought \nlike lions.  As the other British chiefs were jealous of him, and \nwere always quarrelling with him, and with one another, he gave up, \nand proposed peace.  Julius Caesar was very glad to grant peace \neasily, and to go away again with all his remaining ships and men.  \nHe had expected to find pearls in Britain, and he may have found a \nfew for anything I know; but, at all events, he found delicious \noysters, and I am sure he found tough Britons - of whom, I dare \nsay, he made the same complaint as Napoleon Bonaparte the great \nFrench General did, eighteen hundred years afterwards, when he said \nthey were such unreasonable fellows that they never knew when they \nwere beaten.  They never DID know, I believe, and never will.\n\nNearly a hundred years passed on, and all that time, there was \npeace in Britain.  The Britons improved their towns and mode of \nlife:  became more civilised, travelled, and learnt a great deal \nfrom the Gauls and Romans.  At last, the Roman Emperor, Claudius, \nsent AULUS PLAUTIUS, a skilful general, with a mighty force, to \nsubdue the Island, and shortly afterwards arrived himself.  They \ndid little; and OSTORIUS SCAPULA, another general, came.  Some of \nthe British Chiefs of Tribes submitted.  Others resolved to fight \nto the death.  Of these brave men, the bravest was CARACTACUS, or \nCARADOC, who gave battle to the Romans, with his army, among the \nmountains of North Wales.  \'This day,\' said he to his soldiers, \n\'decides the fate of Britain!  Your liberty, or your eternal \nslavery, dates from this hour.  Remember your brave ancestors, who \ndrove the great Caesar himself across the sea!\'  On hearing these \nwords, his men, with a great shout, rushed upon the Romans.  But \nthe strong Roman swords and armour were too much for the weaker \nBritish weapons in close conflict.  The Britons lost the day.  The \nwife and daughter of the brave CARACTACUS were taken prisoners; his \nbrothers delivered themselves up; he himself was betrayed into the \nhands of the Romans by his false and base stepmother:  and they \ncarried him, and all his family, in triumph to Rome.\n\nBut a great man will be great in misfortune, great in prison, great \nin chains.  His noble air, and dignified endurance of distress, so \ntouched the Roman people who thronged the streets to see him, that \nhe and his family were restored to freedom.  No one knows whether \nhis great heart broke, and he died in Rome, or whether he ever \nreturned to his own dear country.  English oaks have grown up from \nacorns, and withered away, when they were hundreds of years old - \nand other oaks have sprung up in their places, and died too, very \naged - since the rest of the history of the brave CARACTACUS was \nforgotten.\n\nStill, the Britons WOULD NOT yield.  They rose again and again, and \ndied by thousands, sword in hand.  They rose, on every possible \noccasion.  SUETONIUS, another Roman general, came, and stormed the \nIsland of Anglesey (then called MONA), which was supposed to be \nsacred, and he burnt the Druids in their own wicker cages, by their \nown fires.  But, even while he was in Britain, with his victorious \ntroops, the BRITONS rose.  Because BOADICEA, a British queen, the \nwidow of the King of the Norfolk and Suffolk people, resisted the \nplundering of her property by the Romans who were settled in \nEngland, she was scourged, by order of CATUS a Roman officer; and \nher two daughters were shamefully insulted in her presence, and her \nhusband\'s relations were made slaves.  To avenge this injury, the \nBritons rose, with all their might and rage.  They drove CATUS into \nGaul; they laid the Roman possessions waste; they forced the Romans \nout of London, then a poor little town, but a trading place; they \nhanged, burnt, crucified, and slew by the sword, seventy thousand \nRomans in a few days.  SUETONIUS strengthened his army, and \nadvanced to give them battle.  They strengthened their army, and \ndesperately attacked his, on the field where it was strongly \nposted.  Before the first charge of the Britons was made, BOADICEA, \nin a war-chariot, with her fair hair streaming in the wind, and her \ninjured daughters lying at her feet, drove among the troops, and \ncried to them for vengeance on their oppressors, the licentious \nRomans.  The Britons fought to the last; but they were vanquished \nwith great slaughter, and the unhappy queen took poison.\n\nStill, the spirit of the Britons was not broken.  When SUETONIUS \nleft the country, they fell upon his troops, and retook the Island \nof Anglesey.  AGRICOLA came, fifteen or twenty years afterwards, \nand retook it once more, and devoted seven years to subduing the \ncountry, especially that part of it which is now called SCOTLAND; \nbut, its people, the Caledonians, resisted him at every inch of \nground.  They fought the bloodiest battles with him; they killed \ntheir very wives and children, to prevent his making prisoners of \nthem; they fell, fighting, in such great numbers that certain hills \nin Scotland are yet supposed to be vast heaps of stones piled up \nabove their graves.  HADRIAN came, thirty years afterwards, and \nstill they resisted him.  SEVERUS came, nearly a hundred years \nafterwards, and they worried his great army like dogs, and rejoiced \nto see them die, by thousands, in the bogs and swamps.  CARACALLA, \nthe son and successor of SEVERUS, did the most to conquer them, for \na time; but not by force of arms.  He knew how little that would \ndo.  He yielded up a quantity of land to the Caledonians, and gave \nthe Britons the same privileges as the Romans possessed.  There was \npeace, after this, for seventy years.\n\nThen new enemies arose.  They were the Saxons, a fierce, sea-faring \npeople from the countries to the North of the Rhine, the great \nriver of Germany on the banks of which the best grapes grow to make \nthe German wine.  They began to come, in pirate ships, to the sea-\ncoast of Gaul and Britain, and to plunder them.  They were repulsed \nby CARAUSIUS, a native either of Belgium or of Britain, who was \nappointed by the Romans to the command, and under whom the Britons \nfirst began to fight upon the sea.  But, after this time, they \nrenewed their ravages.  A few years more, and the Scots (which was \nthen the name for the people of Ireland), and the Picts, a northern \npeople, began to make frequent plundering incursions into the South \nof Britain.  All these attacks were repeated, at intervals, during \ntwo hundred years, and through a long succession of Roman Emperors \nand chiefs; during all which length of time, the Britons rose \nagainst the Romans, over and over again.  At last, in the days of \nthe Roman HONORIUS, when the Roman power all over the world was \nfast declining, and when Rome wanted all her soldiers at home, the \nRomans abandoned all hope of conquering Britain, and went away.  \nAnd still, at last, as at first, the Britons rose against them, in \ntheir old brave manner; for, a very little while before, they had \nturned away the Roman magistrates, and declared themselves an \nindependent people.\n\nFive hundred years had passed, since Julius Caesar\'s first invasion \nof the Island, when the Romans departed from it for ever.  In the \ncourse of that time, although they had been the cause of terrible \nfighting and bloodshed, they had done much to improve the condition \nof the Britons.  They had made great military roads; they had built \nforts; they had taught them how to dress, and arm themselves, much \nbetter than they had ever known how to do before; they had refined \nthe whole British way of living.  AGRICOLA had built a great wall \nof earth, more than seventy miles long, extending from Newcastle to \nbeyond Carlisle, for the purpose of keeping out the Picts and \nScots; HADRIAN had strengthened it; SEVERUS, finding it much in \nwant of repair, had built it afresh of stone.\n\nAbove all, it was in the Roman time, and by means of Roman ships, \nthat the Christian Religion was first brought into Britain, and its \npeople first taught the great lesson that, to be good in the sight \nof GOD, they must love their neighbours as themselves, and do unto \nothers as they would be done by.  The Druids declared that it was \nvery wicked to believe in any such thing, and cursed all the people \nwho did believe it, very heartily.  But, when the people found that \nthey were none the better for the blessings of the Druids, and none \nthe worse for the curses of the Druids, but, that the sun shone and \nthe rain fell without consulting the Druids at all, they just began \nto think that the Druids were mere men, and that it signified very \nlittle whether they cursed or blessed.  After which, the pupils of \nthe Druids fell off greatly in numbers, and the Druids took to \nother trades.\n\nThus I have come to the end of the Roman time in England.  It is \nbut little that is known of those five hundred years; but some \nremains of them are still found.  Often, when labourers are digging \nup the ground, to make foundations for houses or churches, they \nlight on rusty money that once belonged to the Romans.  Fragments \nof plates from which they ate, of goblets from which they drank, \nand of pavement on which they trod, are discovered among the earth \nthat is broken by the plough, or the dust that is crumbled by the \ngardener\'s spade.  Wells that the Romans sunk, still yield water; \nroads that the Romans made, form part of our highways.  In some old \nbattle-fields, British spear-heads and Roman armour have been \nfound, mingled together in decay, as they fell in the thick \npressure of the fight.  Traces of Roman camps overgrown with grass, \nand of mounds that are the burial-places of heaps of Britons, are \nto be seen in almost all parts of the country.  Across the bleak \nmoors of Northumberland, the wall of SEVERUS, overrun with moss and \nweeds, still stretches, a strong ruin; and the shepherds and their \ndogs lie sleeping on it in the summer weather.  On Salisbury Plain, \nStonehenge yet stands:  a monument of the earlier time when the \nRoman name was unknown in Britain, and when the Druids, with their \nbest magic wands, could not have written it in the sands of the \nwild sea-shore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II - ANCIENT ENGLAND UNDER THE EARLY SAXONS\n\n\n\nTHE Romans had scarcely gone away from Britain, when the Britons \nbegan to wish they had never left it.  For, the Romans being gone, \nand the Britons being much reduced in numbers by their long wars, \nthe Picts and Scots came pouring in, over the broken and unguarded \nwall of SEVERUS, in swarms.  They plundered the richest towns, and \nkilled the people; and came back so often for more booty and more \nslaughter, that the unfortunate Britons lived a life of terror.  As \nif the Picts and Scots were not bad enough on land, the Saxons \nattacked the islanders by sea; and, as if something more were still \nwanting to make them miserable, they quarrelled bitterly among \nthemselves as to what prayers they ought to say, and how they ought \nto say them.  The priests, being very angry with one another on \nthese questions, cursed one another in the heartiest manner; and \n(uncommonly like the old Druids) cursed all the people whom they \ncould not persuade.  So, altogether, the Britons were very badly \noff, you may believe.\n\nThey were in such distress, in short, that they sent a letter to \nRome entreating help - which they called the Groans of the Britons; \nand in which they said, \'The barbarians chase us into the sea, the \nsea throws us back upon the barbarians, and we have only the hard \nchoice left us of perishing by the sword, or perishing by the \nwaves.\'  But, the Romans could not help them, even if they were so \ninclined; for they had enough to do to defend themselves against \ntheir own enemies, who were then very fierce and strong.  At last, \nthe Britons, unable to bear their hard condition any longer, \nresolved to make peace with the Saxons, and to invite the Saxons to \ncome into their country, and help them to keep out the Picts and \nScots.\n\nIt was a British Prince named VORTIGERN who took this resolution, \nand who made a treaty of friendship with HENGIST and HORSA, two \nSaxon chiefs.  Both of these names, in the old Saxon language, \nsignify Horse; for the Saxons, like many other nations in a rough \nstate, were fond of giving men the names of animals, as Horse, \nWolf, Bear, Hound.  The Indians of North America, - a very inferior \npeople to the Saxons, though - do the same to this day.\n\nHENGIST and HORSA drove out the Picts and Scots; and VORTIGERN, \nbeing grateful to them for that service, made no opposition to \ntheir settling themselves in that part of England which is called \nthe Isle of Thanet, or to their inviting over more of their \ncountrymen to join them.  But HENGIST had a beautiful daughter \nnamed ROWENA; and when, at a feast, she filled a golden goblet to \nthe brim with wine, and gave it to VORTIGERN, saying in a sweet \nvoice, \'Dear King, thy health!\' the King fell in love with her.  My \nopinion is, that the cunning HENGIST meant him to do so, in order \nthat the Saxons might have greater influence with him; and that the \nfair ROWENA came to that feast, golden goblet and all, on purpose.\n\nAt any rate, they were married; and, long afterwards, whenever the \nKing was angry with the Saxons, or jealous of their encroachments, \nROWENA would put her beautiful arms round his neck, and softly say, \n\'Dear King, they are my people!  Be favourable to them, as you \nloved that Saxon girl who gave you the golden goblet of wine at the \nfeast!\'  And, really, I don\'t see how the King could help himself.\n\nAh!  We must all die!  In the course of years, VORTIGERN died - he \nwas dethroned, and put in prison, first, I am afraid; and ROWENA \ndied; and generations of Saxons and Britons died; and events that \nhappened during a long, long time, would have been quite forgotten \nbut for the tales and songs of the old Bards, who used to go about \nfrom feast to feast, with their white beards, recounting the deeds \nof their forefathers.  Among the histories of which they sang and \ntalked, there was a famous one, concerning the bravery and virtues \nof KING ARTHUR, supposed to have been a British Prince in those old \ntimes.  But, whether such a person really lived, or whether there \nwere several persons whose histories came to be confused together \nunder that one name, or whether all about him was invention, no one \nknows.\n\nI will tell you, shortly, what is most interesting in the early \nSaxon times, as they are described in these songs and stories of \nthe Bards.\n\nIn, and long after, the days of VORTIGERN, fresh bodies of Saxons, \nunder various chiefs, came pouring into Britain.  One body, \nconquering the Britons in the East, and settling there, called \ntheir kingdom Essex; another body settled in the West, and called \ntheir kingdom Wessex; the Northfolk, or Norfolk people, established \nthemselves in one place; the Southfolk, or Suffolk people, \nestablished themselves in another; and gradually seven kingdoms or \nstates arose in England, which were called the Saxon Heptarchy.  \nThe poor Britons, falling back before these crowds of fighting men \nwhom they had innocently invited over as friends, retired into \nWales and the adjacent country; into Devonshire, and into Cornwall.  \nThose parts of England long remained unconquered.  And in Cornwall \nnow - where the sea-coast is very gloomy, steep, and rugged - \nwhere, in the dark winter-time, ships have often been wrecked close \nto the land, and every soul on board has perished - where the winds \nand waves howl drearily and split the solid rocks into arches and \ncaverns - there are very ancient ruins, which the people call the \nruins of KING ARTHUR\'S Castle.\n\nKent is the most famous of the seven Saxon kingdoms, because the \nChristian religion was preached to the Saxons there (who domineered \nover the Britons too much, to care for what THEY said about their \nreligion, or anything else) by AUGUSTINE, a monk from Rome.  KING \nETHELBERT, of Kent, was soon converted; and the moment he said he \nwas a Christian, his courtiers all said THEY were Christians; after \nwhich, ten thousand of his subjects said they were Christians too.  \nAUGUSTINE built a little church, close to this King\'s palace, on \nthe ground now occupied by the beautiful cathedral of Canterbury.  \nSEBERT, the King\'s nephew, built on a muddy marshy place near \nLondon, where there had been a temple to Apollo, a church dedicated \nto Saint Peter, which is now Westminster Abbey.  And, in London \nitself, on the foundation of a temple to Diana, he built another \nlittle church which has risen up, since that old time, to be Saint \nPaul\'s.\n\nAfter the death of ETHELBERT, EDWIN, King of Northumbria, who was \nsuch a good king that it was said a woman or child might openly \ncarry a purse of gold, in his reign, without fear, allowed his \nchild to be baptised, and held a great council to consider whether \nhe and his people should all be Christians or not.  It was decided \nthat they should be.  COIFI, the chief priest of the old religion, \nmade a great speech on the occasion.  In this discourse, he told \nthe people that he had found out the old gods to be impostors.  \'I \nam quite satisfied of it,\' he said.  \'Look at me!  I have been \nserving them all my life, and they have done nothing for me; \nwhereas, if they had been really powerful, they could not have \ndecently done less, in return for all I have done for them, than \nmake my fortune.  As they have never made my fortune, I am quite \nconvinced they are impostors!\'  When this singular priest had \nfinished speaking, he hastily armed himself with sword and lance, \nmounted a war-horse, rode at a furious gallop in sight of all the \npeople to the temple, and flung his lance against it as an insult.  \nFrom that time, the Christian religion spread itself among the \nSaxons, and became their faith.\n\nThe next very famous prince was EGBERT.  He lived about a hundred \nand fifty years afterwards, and claimed to have a better right to \nthe throne of Wessex than BEORTRIC, another Saxon prince who was at \nthe head of that kingdom, and who married EDBURGA, the daughter of \nOFFA, king of another of the seven kingdoms.  This QUEEN EDBURGA \nwas a handsome murderess, who poisoned people when they offended \nher.  One day, she mixed a cup of poison for a certain noble \nbelonging to the court; but her husband drank of it too, by \nmistake, and died.  Upon this, the people revolted, in great \ncrowds; and running to the palace, and thundering at the gates, \ncried, \'Down with the wicked queen, who poisons men!\'  They drove \nher out of the country, and abolished the title she had disgraced.  \nWhen years had passed away, some travellers came home from Italy, \nand said that in the town of Pavia they had seen a ragged beggar-\nwoman, who had once been handsome, but was then shrivelled, bent, \nand yellow, wandering about the streets, crying for bread; and that \nthis beggar-woman was the poisoning English queen.  It was, indeed, \nEDBURGA; and so she died, without a shelter for her wretched head.\n\nEGBERT, not considering himself safe in England, in consequence of \nhis having claimed the crown of Wessex (for he thought his rival \nmight take him prisoner and put him to death), sought refuge at the \ncourt of CHARLEMAGNE, King of France.  On the death of BEORTRIC, so \nunhappily poisoned by mistake, EGBERT came back to Britain; \nsucceeded to the throne of Wessex; conquered some of the other \nmonarchs of the seven kingdoms; added their territories to his own; \nand, for the first time, called the country over which he ruled, \nENGLAND.\n\nAnd now, new enemies arose, who, for a long time, troubled England \nsorely.  These were the Northmen, the people of Denmark and Norway, \nwhom the English called the Danes.  They were a warlike people, \nquite at home upon the sea; not Christians; very daring and cruel.  \nThey came over in ships, and plundered and burned wheresoever they \nlanded.  Once, they beat EGBERT in battle.  Once, EGBERT beat them.  \nBut, they cared no more for being beaten than the English \nthemselves.  In the four following short reigns, of ETHELWULF, and \nhis sons, ETHELBALD, ETHELBERT, and ETHELRED, they came back, over \nand over again, burning and plundering, and laying England waste.  \nIn the last-mentioned reign, they seized EDMUND, King of East \nEngland, and bound him to a tree.  Then, they proposed to him that \nhe should change his religion; but he, being a good Christian, \nsteadily refused.  Upon that, they beat him, made cowardly jests \nupon him, all defenceless as he was, shot arrows at him, and, \nfinally, struck off his head.  It is impossible to say whose head \nthey might have struck off next, but for the death of KING ETHELRED \nfrom a wound he had received in fighting against them, and the \nsuccession to his throne of the best and wisest king that ever \nlived in England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III - ENGLAND UNDER THE GOOD SAXON, ALFRED\n\n\n\nALFRED THE GREAT was a young man, three-and-twenty years of age, \nwhen he became king.  Twice in his childhood, he had been taken to \nRome, where the Saxon nobles were in the habit of going on journeys \nwhich they supposed to be religious; and, once, he had stayed for \nsome time in Paris.  Learning, however, was so little cared for, \nthen, that at twelve years old he had not been taught to read; \nalthough, of the sons of KING ETHELWULF, he, the youngest, was the \nfavourite.  But he had - as most men who grow up to be great and \ngood are generally found to have had - an excellent mother; and, \none day, this lady, whose name was OSBURGA, happened, as she was \nsitting among her sons, to read a book of Saxon poetry.  The art of \nprinting was not known until long and long after that period, and \nthe book, which was written, was what is called \'illuminated,\' with \nbeautiful bright letters, richly painted.  The brothers admiring it \nvery much, their mother said, \'I will give it to that one of you \nfour princes who first learns to read.\'  ALFRED sought out a tutor \nthat very day, applied himself to learn with great diligence, and \nsoon won the book.  He was proud of it, all his life.\n\nThis great king, in the first year of his reign, fought nine \nbattles with the Danes.  He made some treaties with them too, by \nwhich the false Danes swore they would quit the country.  They \npretended to consider that they had taken a very solemn oath, in \nswearing this upon the holy bracelets that they wore, and which \nwere always buried with them when they died; but they cared little \nfor it, for they thought nothing of breaking oaths and treaties \ntoo, as soon as it suited their purpose, and coming back again to \nfight, plunder, and burn, as usual.  One fatal winter, in the \nfourth year of KING ALFRED\'S reign, they spread themselves in great \nnumbers over the whole of England; and so dispersed and routed the \nKing\'s soldiers that the King was left alone, and was obliged to \ndisguise himself as a common peasant, and to take refuge in the \ncottage of one of his cowherds who did not know his face.\n\nHere, KING ALFRED, while the Danes sought him far and near, was \nleft alone one day, by the cowherd\'s wife, to watch some cakes \nwhich she put to bake upon the hearth.  But, being at work upon his \nbow and arrows, with which he hoped to punish the false Danes when \na brighter time should come, and thinking deeply of his poor \nunhappy subjects whom the Danes chased through the land, his noble \nmind forgot the cakes, and they were burnt.  \'What!\' said the \ncowherd\'s wife, who scolded him well when she came back, and little \nthought she was scolding the King, \'you will be ready enough to eat \nthem by-and-by, and yet you cannot watch them, idle dog?\'\n\nAt length, the Devonshire men made head against a new host of Danes \nwho landed on their coast; killed their chief, and captured their \nflag; on which was represented the likeness of a Raven - a very fit \nbird for a thievish army like that, I think.  The loss of their \nstandard troubled the Danes greatly, for they believed it to be \nenchanted - woven by the three daughters of one father in a single \nafternoon - and they had a story among themselves that when they \nwere victorious in battle, the Raven stretched his wings and seemed \nto fly; and that when they were defeated, he would droop.";
