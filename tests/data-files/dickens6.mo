The\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\nfiles per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach 80 billion Etexts.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\n\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/BU\":  and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

They are England and Scotland, and Ireland.  England and \nScotland form the greater part of these Islands.  Ireland is the \nnext in size.  The little neighbouring islands, which are so small \nupon the Map as to be mere dots, are chiefly little bits of \nScotland, - broken off, I dare say, in the course of a great length \nof time, by the power of the restless water.\n\nIn the old days, a long, long while ago, before Our Saviour was \nborn on earth and lay asleep in a manger, these Islands were in the \nsame place, and the stormy sea roared round them, just as it roars \nnow.  But the sea was not alive, then, with great ships and brave \nsailors, sailing to and from all parts of the world.  It was very \nlonely.  The Islands lay solitary, in the great expanse of water.  \nThe foaming waves dashed against their cliffs, and the bleak winds \nblew over their forests; but the winds and waves brought no \nadventurers to land upon the Islands, and the savage Islanders knew \nnothing of the rest of the world, and the rest of the world knew \nnothing of them.\n\nIt is supposed that the Phoenicians, who were an ancient people, \nfamous for carrying on trade, came in ships to these Islands, and \nfound that they produced tin and lead; both very useful things, as \nyou know, and both produced to this very hour upon the sea-coast. \nThe most celebrated tin mines in Cornwall are, still, close to the \nsea.  One of them, which I have seen, is so close to it that it is \nhollowed out underneath the ocean; and the miners say, that in \nstormy weather, when they are at work down in that deep place, they \ncan hear the noise of the waves thundering above their heads.  So, \nthe Phoenicians, coasting about the Islands, would come, without \nmuch difficulty, to where the tin and lead were.\n\nThe Phoenicians traded with the Islanders for these metals, and \ngave the Islanders some other useful things in exchange.  The \nIslanders were, at first, poor savages, going almost naked, or only \ndressed in the rough skins of beasts, and staining their bodies, as \nother savages do, with coloured earths and the juices of plants.  \nBut the Phoenicians, sailing over to the opposite coasts of France \nand Belgium, and saying to the people there, \'We have been to those \nwhite cliffs across the water, which you can see in fine weather, \nand from that country, which is called BRITAIN, we bring this tin \nand lead,\' tempted some of the French and Belgians to come over \nalso.  These people settled themselves on the south coast of \nEngland, which is now called Kent; and, although they were a rough \npeople too, they taught the savage Britons some useful arts, and \nimproved that part of the Islands.  It is probable that other \npeople came over from Spain to Ireland, and settled there.\n\nThus, by little and little, strangers became mixed with the \nIslanders, and the savage Britons grew into a wild, bold people; \nalmost savage, still, especially in the interior of the country \naway from the sea where the foreign settlers seldom went; but \nhardy, brave, and strong.\n\nThe whole country was covered with forests, and swamps.  The \ngreater part of it was very misty and cold.  There were no roads, \nno bridges, no streets, no houses that you would think deserving of \nthe name.  A town was nothing but a collection of straw-covered \nhuts, hidden in a thick wood, with a ditch all round, and a low \nwall, made of mud, or the trunks of trees placed one upon another.  \nThe people planted little or no corn, but lived upon the flesh of \ntheir flocks and cattle.  They made no coins, but used metal rings \nfor money.  They were clever in basket-work, as savage people often \nare; and they could make a coarse kind of cloth, and some very bad \nearthenware.  But in building fortresses they were much more \nclever.\n\nThey made boats of basket-work, covered with the skins of animals, \nbut seldom, if ever, ventured far from the shore.  They made \nswords, of copper mixed with tin; but, these swords were of an \nawkward shape, and so soft that a heavy blow would bend one.  They \nmade light shields, short pointed daggers, and spears - which they \njerked back after they had thrown them at an enemy, by a long strip \nof leather fastened to the stem.  The butt-end was a rattle, to \nfrighten an enemy\'s horse.  The ancient Britons, being divided into \nas many as thirty or forty tribes, each commanded by its own little \nking, were constantly fighting with one another, as savage people \nusually do; and they always fought with these weapons.\n\nThey were very fond of horses.  The standard of Kent was the \npicture of a white horse.  They could break them in and manage them \nwonderfully well.  Indeed, the horses (of which they had an \nabundance, though they were rather small) were so well taught in \nthose days, that they can scarcely be said to have improved since; \nthough the men are so much wiser.  They understood, and obeyed, \nevery word of command; and would stand still by themselves, in all \nthe din and noise of battle, while their masters went to fight on \nfoot.  The Britons could not have succeeded in their most \nremarkable art, without the aid of these sensible and trusty \nanimals.  The art I mean, is the construction and management of \nwar-chariots or cars, for which they have ever been celebrated in \nhistory.  Each of the best sort of these chariots, not quite breast \nhigh in front, and open at the back, contained one man to drive, \nand two or three others to fight - all standing up.  The horses who \ndrew them were so well trained, that they would tear, at full \ngallop, over the most stony ways, and even through the woods; \ndashing down their masters\' enemies beneath their hoofs, and \ncutting them to pieces with the blades of swords, or scythes, which \nwere fastened to the wheels, and stretched out beyond the car on \neach side, for that cruel purpose.  In a moment, while at full \nspeed, the horses would stop, at the driver\'s command.  The men \nwithin would leap out, deal blows about them with their swords like \nhail, leap on the horses, on the pole, spring back into the \nchariots anyhow; and, as soon as they were safe, the horses tore \naway again.\n\nThe Britons had a strange and terrible religion, called the \nReligion of the Druids.  It seems to have been brought over, in \nvery early times indeed, from the opposite country of France, \nanciently called Gaul, and to have mixed up the worship of the \nSerpent, and of the Sun and Moon, with the worship of some of the \nHeathen Gods and Goddesses.  Most of its ceremonies were kept \nsecret by the priests, the Druids, who pretended to be enchanters, \nand who carried magicians\' wands, and wore, each of them, about his \nneck, what he told the ignorant people was a Serpent\'s egg in a \ngolden case.  But it is certain that the Druidical ceremonies \nincluded the sacrifice of human victims, the torture of some \nsuspected criminals, and, on particular occasions, even the burning \nalive, in immense wicker cages, of a number of men and animals \ntogether.  The Druid Priests had some kind of veneration for the \nOak, and for the mistletoe - the same plant that we hang up in \nhouses at Christmas Time now - when its white berries grew upon the \nOak.  They met together in dark woods, which they called Sacred \nGroves; and there they instructed, in their mysterious arts, young \nmen who came to them as pupils, and who sometimes stayed with them \nas long as twenty years.\n\nThese Druids built great Temples and altars, open to the sky, \nfragments of some of which are yet remaining.  Stonehenge, on \nSalisbury Plain, in Wiltshire, is the most extraordinary of these.  \nThree curious stones, called Kits Coty House, on Bluebell Hill, \nnear Maidstone, in Kent, form another.  We know, from examination \nof the great blocks of which such buildings are made, that they \ncould not have been raised without the aid of some ingenious \nmachines, which are common now, but which the ancient Britons \ncertainly did not use in making their own uncomfortable houses.  I \nshould not wonder if the Druids, and their pupils who stayed with \nthem twenty years, knowing more than the rest of the Britons, kept \nthe people out of sight while they made these buildings, and then \npretended that they built them by magic.  Perhaps they had a hand \nin the fortresses too; at all events, as they were very powerful, \nand very much believed in, and as they made and executed the laws, \nand paid no taxes, I don\'t wonder that they liked their trade.  \nAnd, as they persuaded the people the more Druids there were, the \nbetter off the people would be, I don\'t wonder that there were a \ngood many of them.  But it is pleasant to think that there are no \nDruids, NOW, who go on in that way, and pretend to carry \nEnchanters\' Wands and Serpents\' Eggs - and of course there is \nnothing of the kind, anywhere.\n\nSuch was the improved condition of the ancient Britons, fifty-five \nyears before the birth of Our Saviour, when the Romans, under their \ngreat General, Julius Caesar, were masters of all the rest of the \nknown world.  Julius Caesar had then just conquered Gaul; and \nhearing, in Gaul, a good deal about the opposite Island with the \nwhite cliffs, and about the bravery of the Britons who inhabited it \n- some of whom had been fetched over to help the Gauls in the war \nagainst him - he resolved, as he was so near, to come and conquer \nBritain next.\n\nSo, Julius Caesar came sailing over to this Island of ours, with \neighty vessels and twelve thousand men.  And he came from the \nFrench coast between Calais and Boulogne, \'because thence was the \nshortest passage into Britain;\' just for the same reason as our \nsteam-boats now take the same track, every day.  He expected to \nconquer Britain easily:  but it was not such easy work as he \nsupposed - for the bold Britons fought most bravely; and, what with \nnot having his horse-soldiers with him (for they had been driven \nback by a storm), and what with having some of his vessels dashed \nto pieces by a high tide after they were drawn ashore, he ran great \nrisk of being totally defeated.  However, for once that the bold \nBritons beat him, he beat them twice; though not so soundly but \nthat he was very glad to accept their proposals of peace, and go \naway.\n\nBut, in the spring of the next year, he came back; this time, with \neight hundred vessels and thirty thousand men.  The British tribes \nchose, as their general-in-chief, a Briton, whom the Romans in \ntheir Latin language called CASSIVELLAUNUS, but whose British name \nis supposed to have been CASWALLON.  A brave general he was, and \nwell he and his soldiers fought the Roman army!  So well, that \nwhenever in that war the Roman soldiers saw a great cloud of dust, \nand heard the rattle of the rapid British chariots, they trembled \nin their hearts.  Besides a number of smaller battles, there was a \nbattle fought near Canterbury, in Kent; there was a battle fought \nnear Chertsey, in Surrey; there was a battle fought near a marshy \nlittle town in a wood, the capital of that part of Britain which \nbelonged to CASSIVELLAUNUS, and which was probably near what is now \nSaint Albans, in Hertfordshire.  However, brave CASSIVELLAUNUS had \nthe worst of it, on the whole; though he and his men always fought \nlike lions.  As the other British chiefs were jealous of him, and \nwere always quarrelling with him, and with one another, he gave up, \nand proposed peace.  Julius Caesar was very glad to grant peace \neasily, and to go away again with all his remaining ships and men.  \nHe had expected to find pearls in Britain, and he may have found a \nfew for anything I know; but, at all events, he found delicious \noysters, and I am sure he found tough Britons - of whom, I dare \nsay, he made the same complaint as Napoleon Bonaparte the great \nFrench General did, eighteen hundred years afterwards, when he said \nthey were such unreasonable fellows that they never knew when they \nwere beaten.  They never DID know, I believe, and never will.\n\nNearly a hundred years passed on, and all that time, there was \npeace in Britain.  The Britons improved their towns and mode of \nlife:  became more civilised, travelled, and learnt a great deal \nfrom the Gauls and Romans.  At last, the Roman Emperor, Claudius, \nsent AULUS PLAUTIUS, a skilful general, with a mighty force, to \nsubdue the Island, and shortly afterwards arrived himself.  They \ndid little; and OSTORIUS SCAPULA, another general, came.  Some of \nthe British Chiefs of Tribes submitted.  Others resolved to fight \nto the death.  Of these brave men, the bravest was CARACTACUS, or \nCARADOC, who gave battle to the Romans, with his army, among the \nmountains of North Wales.  \'This day,\' said he to his soldiers, \n\'decides the fate of Britain!  Your liberty, or your eternal \nslavery, dates from this hour.  Remember your brave ancestors, who \ndrove the great Caesar himself across the sea!\'  On hearing these \nwords, his men, with a great shout, rushed upon the Romans.  But \nthe strong Roman swords and armour were too much for the weaker \nBritish weapons in close conflict.  The Britons lost the day.  The \nwife and daughter of the brave CARACTACUS were taken prisoners; his \nbrothers delivered themselves up; he himself was betrayed into the \nhands of the Romans by his false and base stepmother:  and they \ncarried him, and all his family, in triumph to Rome.\n\nBut a great man will be great in misfortune, great in prison, great \nin chains.  His noble air, and dignified endurance of distress, so \ntouched the Roman people who thronged the streets to see him, that \nhe and his family were restored to freedom.  No one knows whether \nhis great heart broke, and he died in Rome, or whether he ever \nreturned to his own dear country.  English oaks have grown up from \nacorns, and withered away, when they were hundreds of years old - \nand other oaks have sprung up in their places, and died too, very \naged - since the rest of the history of the brave CARACTACUS was \nforgotten.\n\nStill, the Britons WOULD NOT yield.  They rose again and again, and \ndied by thousands, sword in hand.  They rose, on every possible \noccasion.  SUETONIUS, another Roman general, came, and stormed the \nIsland of Anglesey (then called MONA), which was supposed to be \nsacred, and he burnt the Druids in their own wicker cages, by their \nown fires.  But, even while he was in Britain, with his victorious \ntroops, the BRITONS rose.  Because BOADICEA, a British queen, the \nwidow of the King of the Norfolk and Suffolk people, resisted the \nplundering of her property by the Romans who were settled in \nEngland, she was scourged, by order of CATUS a Roman officer; and \nher two daughters were shamefully insulted in her presence, and her \nhusband\'s relations were made slaves.  To avenge this injury, the \nBritons rose, with all their might and rage.  They drove CATUS into \nGaul; they laid the Roman possessions waste; they forced the Romans \nout of London, then a poor little town, but a trading place; they \nhanged, burnt, crucified, and slew by the sword, seventy thousand \nRomans in a few days.  SUETONIUS strengthened his army, and \nadvanced to give them battle.  They strengthened their army, and \ndesperately attacked his, on the field where it was strongly \nposted.  Before the first charge of the Britons was made, BOADICEA, \nin a war-chariot, with her fair hair streaming in the wind, and her \ninjured daughters lying at her feet, drove among the troops, and \ncried to them for vengeance on their oppressors, the licentious \nRomans.  The Britons fought to the last; but they were vanquished \nwith great slaughter, and the unhappy queen took poison.\n\nStill, the spirit of the Britons was not broken.  When SUETONIUS \nleft the country, they fell upon his troops, and retook the Island \nof Anglesey.  AGRICOLA came, fifteen or twenty years afterwards, \nand retook it once more, and devoted seven years to subduing the \ncountry, especially that part of it which is now called SCOTLAND; \nbut, its people, the Caledonians, resisted him at every inch of \nground.  They fought the bloodiest battles with him; they killed \ntheir very wives and children, to prevent his making prisoners of \nthem; they fell, fighting, in such great numbers that certain hills \nin Scotland are yet supposed to be vast heaps of stones piled up \nabove their graves.  HADRIAN came, thirty years afterwards, and \nstill they resisted him.  SEVERUS came, nearly a hundred years \nafterwards, and they worried his great army like dogs, and rejoiced \nto see them die, by thousands, in the bogs and swamps.  CARACALLA, \nthe son and successor of SEVERUS, did the most to conquer them, for \na time; but not by force of arms.  He knew how little that would \ndo.  He yielded up a quantity of land to the Caledonians, and gave \nthe Britons the same privileges as the Romans possessed.  There was \npeace, after this, for seventy years.\n\nThen new enemies arose.  They were the Saxons, a fierce, sea-faring \npeople from the countries to the North of the Rhine, the great \nriver of Germany on the banks of which the best grapes grow to make \nthe German wine.  They began to come, in pirate ships, to the sea-\ncoast of Gaul and Britain, and to plunder them.  They were repulsed \nby CARAUSIUS, a native either of Belgium or of Britain, who was \nappointed by the Romans to the command, and under whom the Britons \nfirst began to fight upon the sea.  But, after this time, they \nrenewed their ravages.  A few years more, and the Scots (which was \nthen the name for the people of Ireland), and the Picts, a northern \npeople, began to make frequent plundering incursions into the South \nof Britain.  All these attacks were repeated, at intervals, during \ntwo hundred years, and through a long succession of Roman Emperors \nand chiefs; during all which length of time, the Britons rose \nagainst the Romans, over and over again.  At last, in the days of \nthe Roman HONORIUS, when the Roman power all over the world was \nfast declining, and when Rome wanted all her soldiers at home, the \nRomans abandoned all hope of conquering Britain, and went away.  \nAnd still, at last, as at first, the Britons rose against them, in \ntheir old brave manner; for, a very little while before, they had \nturned away the Roman magistrates, and declared themselves an \nindependent people.\n\nFive hundred years had passed, since Julius Caesar\'s first invasion \nof the Island, when the Romans departed from it for ever.  In the \ncourse of that time, although they had been the cause of terrible \nfighting and bloodshed, they had done much to improve the condition \nof the Britons.  They had made great military roads; they had built \nforts; they had taught them how to dress, and arm themselves, much \nbetter than they had ever known how to do before; they had refined \nthe whole British way of living.  AGRICOLA had built a great wall \nof earth, more than seventy miles long, extending from Newcastle to \nbeyond Carlisle, for the purpose of keeping out the Picts and \nScots; HADRIAN had strengthened it; SEVERUS, finding it much in \nwant of repair, had built it afresh of stone.\n\nAbove all, it was in the Roman time, and by means of Roman ships, \nthat the Christian Religion was first brought into Britain, and its \npeople first taught the great lesson that, to be good in the sight \nof GOD, they must love their neighbours as themselves, and do unto \nothers as they would be done by.  The Druids declared that it was \nvery wicked to believe in any such thing, and cursed all the people \nwho did believe it, very heartily.  But, when the people found that \nthey were none the better for the blessings of the Druids, and none \nthe worse for the curses of the Druids, but, that the sun shone and \nthe rain fell without consulting the Druids at all, they just began \nto think that the Druids were mere men, and that it signified very \nlittle whether they cursed or blessed.  After which, the pupils of \nthe Druids fell off greatly in numbers, and the Druids took to \nother trades.\n\nThus I have come to the end of the Roman time in England.  It is \nbut little that is known of those five hundred years; but some \nremains of them are still found.  Often, when labourers are digging \nup the ground, to make foundations for houses or churches, they \nlight on rusty money that once belonged to the Romans.  Fragments \nof plates from which they ate, of goblets from which they drank, \nand of pavement on which they trod, are discovered among the earth \nthat is broken by the plough, or the dust that is crumbled by the \ngardener\'s spade.  Wells that the Romans sunk, still yield water; \nroads that the Romans made, form part of our highways.  In some old \nbattle-fields, British spear-heads and Roman armour have been \nfound, mingled together in decay, as they fell in the thick \npressure of the fight.  Traces of Roman camps overgrown with grass, \nand of mounds that are the burial-places of heaps of Britons, are \nto be seen in almost all parts of the country.  Across the bleak \nmoors of Northumberland, the wall of SEVERUS, overrun with moss and \nweeds, still stretches, a strong ruin; and the shepherds and their \ndogs lie sleeping on it in the summer weather.  On Salisbury Plain, \nStonehenge yet stands:  a monument of the earlier time when the \nRoman name was unknown in Britain, and when the Druids, with their \nbest magic wands, could not have written it in the sands of the \nwild sea-shore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II - ANCIENT ENGLAND UNDER THE EARLY SAXONS\n\n\n\nTHE Romans had scarcely gone away from Britain, when the Britons \nbegan to wish they had never left it.  For, the Romans being gone, \nand the Britons being much reduced in numbers by their long wars, \nthe Picts and Scots came pouring in, over the broken and unguarded \nwall of SEVERUS, in swarms.  They plundered the richest towns, and \nkilled the people; and came back so often for more booty and more \nslaughter, that the unfortunate Britons lived a life of terror.  As \nif the Picts and Scots were not bad enough on land, the Saxons \nattacked the islanders by sea; and, as if something more were still \nwanting to make them miserable, they quarrelled bitterly among \nthemselves as to what prayers they ought to say, and how they ought \nto say them.  The priests, being very angry with one another on \nthese questions, cursed one another in the heartiest manner; and \n(uncommonly like the old Druids) cursed all the people whom they \ncould not persuade.  So, altogether, the Britons were very badly \noff, you may believe.\n\nThey were in such distress, in short, that they sent a letter to \nRome entreating help - which they called the Groans of the Britons; \nand in which they said, \'The barbarians chase us into the sea, the \nsea throws us back upon the barbarians, and we have only the hard \nchoice left us of perishing by the sword, or perishing by the \nwaves.\'  But, the Romans could not help them, even if they were so \ninclined; for they had enough to do to defend themselves against \ntheir own enemies, who were then very fierce and strong.  At last, \nthe Britons, unable to bear their hard condition any longer, \nresolved to make peace with the Saxons, and to invite the Saxons to \ncome into their country, and help them to keep out the Picts and \nScots.\n\nIt was a British Prince named VORTIGERN who took this resolution, \nand who made a treaty of friendship with HENGIST and HORSA, two \nSaxon chiefs.  Both of these names, in the old Saxon language, \nsignify Horse; for the Saxons, like many other nations in a rough \nstate, were fond of giving men the names of animals, as Horse, \nWolf, Bear, Hound.  The Indians of North America, - a very inferior \npeople to the Saxons, though - do the same to this day.\n\nHENGIST and HORSA drove out the Picts and Scots; and VORTIGERN, \nbeing grateful to them for that service, made no opposition to \ntheir settling themselves in that part of England which is called \nthe Isle of Thanet, or to their inviting over more of their \ncountrymen to join them.  But HENGIST had a beautiful daughter \nnamed ROWENA; and when, at a feast, she filled a golden goblet to \nthe brim with wine, and gave it to VORTIGERN, saying in a sweet \nvoice, \'Dear King, thy health!\' the King fell in love with her.  My \nopinion is, that the cunning HENGIST meant him to do so, in order \nthat the Saxons might have greater influence with him; and that the \nfair ROWENA came to that feast, golden goblet and all, on purpose.\n\nAt any rate, they were married; and, long afterwards, whenever the \nKing was angry with the Saxons, or jealous of their encroachments, \nROWENA would put her beautiful arms round his neck, and softly say, \n\'Dear King, they are my people!  Be favourable to them, as you \nloved that Saxon girl who gave you the golden goblet of wine at the \nfeast!\'  And, really, I don\'t see how the King could help himself.\n\nAh!  We must all die!  In the course of years, VORTIGERN died - he \nwas dethroned, and put in prison, first, I am afraid; and ROWENA \ndied; and generations of Saxons and Britons died; and events that \nhappened during a long, long time, would have been quite forgotten \nbut for the tales and songs of the old Bards, who used to go about \nfrom feast to feast, with their white beards, recounting the deeds \nof their forefathers.  Among the histories of which they sang and \ntalked, there was a famous one, concerning the bravery and virtues \nof KING ARTHUR, supposed to have been a British Prince in those old \ntimes.  But, whether such a person really lived, or whether there \nwere several persons whose histories came to be confused together \nunder that one name, or whether all about him was invention, no one \nknows.\n\nI will tell you, shortly, what is most interesting in the early \nSaxon times, as they are described in these songs and stories of \nthe Bards.\n\nIn, and long after, the days of VORTIGERN, fresh bodies of Saxons, \nunder various chiefs, came pouring into Britain.  One body, \nconquering the Britons in the East, and settling there, called \ntheir kingdom Essex; another body settled in the West, and called \ntheir kingdom Wessex; the Northfolk, or Norfolk people, established \nthemselves in one place; the Southfolk, or Suffolk people, \nestablished themselves in another; and gradually seven kingdoms or \nstates arose in England, which were called the Saxon Heptarchy.  \nThe poor Britons, falling back before these crowds of fighting men \nwhom they had innocently invited over as friends, retired into \nWales and the adjacent country; into Devonshire, and into Cornwall.  \nThose parts of England long remained unconquered.  And in Cornwall \nnow - where the sea-coast is very gloomy, steep, and rugged - \nwhere, in the dark winter-time, ships have often been wrecked close \nto the land, and every soul on board has perished - where the winds \nand waves howl drearily and split the solid rocks into arches and \ncaverns - there are very ancient ruins, which the people call the \nruins of KING ARTHUR\'S Castle.\n\nKent is the most famous of the seven Saxon kingdoms, because the \nChristian religion was preached to the Saxons there (who domineered \nover the Britons too much, to care for what THEY said about their \nreligion, or anything else) by AUGUSTINE, a monk from Rome.  KING \nETHELBERT, of Kent, was soon converted; and the moment he said he \nwas a Christian, his courtiers all said THEY were Christians; after \nwhich, ten thousand of his subjects said they were Christians too.  \nAUGUSTINE built a little church, close to this King\'s palace, on \nthe ground now occupied by the beautiful cathedral of Canterbury.  \nSEBERT, the King\'s nephew, built on a muddy marshy place near \nLondon, where there had been a temple to Apollo, a church dedicated \nto Saint Peter, which is now Westminster Abbey.  And, in London \nitself, on the foundation of a temple to Diana, he built another \nlittle church which has risen up, since that old time, to be Saint \nPaul\'s.\n\nAfter the death of ETHELBERT, EDWIN, King of Northumbria, who was \nsuch a good king that it was said a woman or child might openly \ncarry a purse of gold, in his reign, without fear, allowed his \nchild to be baptised, and held a great council to consider whether \nhe and his people should all be Christians or not.  It was decided \nthat they should be.  COIFI, the chief priest of the old religion, \nmade a great speech on the occasion.  In this discourse, he told \nthe people that he had found out the old gods to be impostors.  \'I \nam quite satisfied of it,\' he said.  \'Look at me!  I have been \nserving them all my life, and they have done nothing for me; \nwhereas, if they had been really powerful, they could not have \ndecently done less, in return for all I have done for them, than \nmake my fortune.  As they have never made my fortune, I am quite \nconvinced they are impostors!\'  When this singular priest had \nfinished speaking, he hastily armed himself with sword and lance, \nmounted a war-horse, rode at a furious gallop in sight of all the \npeople to the temple, and flung his lance against it as an insult.  \nFrom that time, the Christian religion spread itself among the \nSaxons, and became their faith.\n\nThe next very famous prince was EGBERT.  He lived about a hundred \nand fifty years afterwards, and claimed to have a better right to \nthe throne of Wessex than BEORTRIC, another Saxon prince who was at \nthe head of that kingdom, and who married EDBURGA, the daughter of \nOFFA, king of another of the seven kingdoms.  This QUEEN EDBURGA \nwas a handsome murderess, who poisoned people when they offended \nher.  One day, she mixed a cup of poison for a certain noble \nbelonging to the court; but her husband drank of it too, by \nmistake, and died.  Upon this, the people revolted, in great \ncrowds; and running to the palace, and thundering at the gates, \ncried, \'Down with the wicked queen, who poisons men!\'  They drove \nher out of the country, and abolished the title she had disgraced.  \nWhen years had passed away, some travellers came home from Italy, \nand said that in the town of Pavia they had seen a ragged beggar-\nwoman, who had once been handsome, but was then shrivelled, bent, \nand yellow, wandering about the streets, crying for bread; and that \nthis beggar-woman was the poisoning English queen.  It was, indeed, \nEDBURGA; and so she died, without a shelter for her wretched head.\n\nEGBERT, not considering himself safe in England, in consequence of \nhis having claimed the crown of Wessex (for he thought his rival \nmight take him prisoner and put him to death), sought refuge at the \ncourt of CHARLEMAGNE, King of France.  On the death of BEORTRIC, so \nunhappily poisoned by mistake, EGBERT came back to Britain; \nsucceeded to the throne of Wessex; conquered some of the other \nmonarchs of the seven kingdoms; added their territories to his own; \nand, for the first time, called the country over which he ruled, \nENGLAND.\n\nAnd now, new enemies arose, who, for a long time, troubled England \nsorely.  These were the Northmen, the people of Denmark and Norway, \nwhom the English called the Danes.  They were a warlike people, \nquite at home upon the sea; not Christians; very daring and cruel.  \nThey came over in ships, and plundered and burned wheresoever they \nlanded.  Once, they beat EGBERT in battle.  Once, EGBERT beat them.  \nBut, they cared no more for being beaten than the English \nthemselves.  In the four following short reigns, of ETHELWULF, and \nhis sons, ETHELBALD, ETHELBERT, and ETHELRED, they came back, over \nand over again, burning and plundering, and laying England waste.  \nIn the last-mentioned reign, they seized EDMUND, King of East \nEngland, and bound him to a tree.  Then, they proposed to him that \nhe should change his religion; but he, being a good Christian, \nsteadily refused.  Upon that, they beat him, made cowardly jests \nupon him, all defenceless as he was, shot arrows at him, and, \nfinally, struck off his head.  It is impossible to say whose head \nthey might have struck off next, but for the death of KING ETHELRED \nfrom a wound he had received in fighting against them, and the \nsuccession to his throne of the best and wisest king that ever \nlived in England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III - ENGLAND UNDER THE GOOD SAXON, ALFRED\n\n\n\nALFRED THE GREAT was a young man, three-and-twenty years of age, \nwhen he became king.  Twice in his childhood, he had been taken to \nRome, where the Saxon nobles were in the habit of going on journeys \nwhich they supposed to be religious; and, once, he had stayed for \nsome time in Paris.  Learning, however, was so little cared for, \nthen, that at twelve years old he had not been taught to read; \nalthough, of the sons of KING ETHELWULF, he, the youngest, was the \nfavourite.  But he had - as most men who grow up to be great and \ngood are generally found to have had - an excellent mother; and, \none day, this lady, whose name was OSBURGA, happened, as she was \nsitting among her sons, to read a book of Saxon poetry.  The art of \nprinting was not known until long and long after that period, and \nthe book, which was written, was what is called \'illuminated,\' with \nbeautiful bright letters, richly painted.  The brothers admiring it \nvery much, their mother said, \'I will give it to that one of you \nfour princes who first learns to read.\'  ALFRED sought out a tutor \nthat very day, applied himself to learn with great diligence, and \nsoon won the book.  He was proud of it, all his life.\n\nThis great king, in the first year of his reign, fought nine \nbattles with the Danes.  He made some treaties with them too, by \nwhich the false Danes swore they would quit the country.  They \npretended to consider that they had taken a very solemn oath, in \nswearing this upon the holy bracelets that they wore, and which \nwere always buried with them when they died; but they cared little \nfor it, for they thought nothing of breaking oaths and treaties \ntoo, as soon as it suited their purpose, and coming back again to \nfight, plunder, and burn, as usual.  One fatal winter, in the \nfourth year of KING ALFRED\'S reign, they spread themselves in great \nnumbers over the whole of England; and so dispersed and routed the \nKing\'s soldiers that the King was left alone, and was obliged to \ndisguise himself as a common peasant, and to take refuge in the \ncottage of one of his cowherds who did not know his face.\n\nHere, KING ALFRED, while the Danes sought him far and near, was \nleft alone one day, by the cowherd\'s wife, to watch some cakes \nwhich she put to bake upon the hearth.  But, being at work upon his \nbow and arrows, with which he hoped to punish the false Danes when \na brighter time should come, and thinking deeply of his poor \nunhappy subjects whom the Danes chased through the land, his noble \nmind forgot the cakes, and they were burnt.  \'What!\' said the \ncowherd\'s wife, who scolded him well when she came back, and little \nthought she was scolding the King, \'you will be ready enough to eat \nthem by-and-by, and yet you cannot watch them, idle dog?\'\n\nAt length, the Devonshire men made head against a new host of Danes \nwho landed on their coast; killed their chief, and captured their \nflag; on which was represented the likeness of a Raven - a very fit \nbird for a thievish army like that, I think.  The loss of their \nstandard troubled the Danes greatly, for they believed it to be \nenchanted - woven by the three daughters of one father in a single \nafternoon - and they had a story among themselves that when they \nwere victorious in battle, the Raven stretched his wings and seemed \nto fly; and that when they were defeated, he would droop.  He had \ngood reason to droop, now, if he could have done anything half so \nsensible; for, KING ALFRED joined the Devonshire men; made a camp \nwith them on a piece of firm ground in the midst of a bog in \nSomersetshire; and prepared for a great attempt for vengeance on \nthe Danes, and the deliverance of his oppressed people.\n\nBut, first, as it was important to know how numerous those \npestilent Danes were, and how they were fortified, KING ALFRED, \nbeing a good musician, disguised himself as a glee-man or minstrel, \nand went, with his harp, to the Danish camp.  He played and sang in \nthe very tent of GUTHRUM the Danish leader, and entertained the \nDanes as they caroused.  While he seemed to think of nothing but \nhis music, he was watchful of their tents, their arms, their \ndiscipline, everything that he desired to know.  And right soon did \nthis great king entertain them to a different tune; for, summoning \nall his true followers to meet him at an appointed place, where \nthey received him with joyful shouts and tears, as the monarch whom \nmany of them had given up for lost or dead, he put himself at their \nhead, marched on the Danish camp, defeated the Danes with great \nslaughter, and besieged them for fourteen days to prevent their \nescape.  But, being as merciful as he was good and brave, he then, \ninstead of killing them, proposed peace:  on condition that they \nshould altogether depart from that Western part of England, and \nsettle in the East; and that GUTHRUM should become a Christian, in \nremembrance of the Divine religion which now taught his conqueror, \nthe noble ALFRED, to forgive the enemy who had so often injured \nhim.  This, GUTHRUM did.  At his baptism, KING ALFRED was his \ngodfather.  And GUTHRUM was an honourable chief who well deserved \nthat clemency; for, ever afterwards he was loyal and faithful to \nthe king.  The Danes under him were faithful too.  They plundered \nand burned no more, but worked like honest men.  They ploughed, and \nsowed, and reaped, and led good honest English lives.  And I hope \nthe children of those Danes played, many a time, with Saxon \nchildren in the sunny fields; and that Danish young men fell in \nlove with Saxon girls, and married them; and that English \ntravellers, benighted at the doors of Danish cottages, often went \nin for shelter until morning; and that Danes and Saxons sat by the \nred fire, friends, talking of KING ALFRED THE GREAT.\n\nAll the Danes were not like these under GUTHRUM; for, after some \nyears, more of them came over, in the old plundering and burning \nway - among them a fierce pirate of the name of HASTINGS, who had \nthe boldness to sail up the Thames to Gravesend, with eighty ships.  \nFor three years, there was a war with these Danes; and there was a \nfamine in the country, too, and a plague, both upon human creatures \nand beasts.  But KING ALFRED, whose mighty heart never failed him, \nbuilt large ships nevertheless, with which to pursue the pirates on \nthe sea; and he encouraged his soldiers, by his brave example, to \nfight valiantly against them on the shore.  At last, he drove them \nall away; and then there was repose in England.\n\nAs great and good in peace, as he was great and good in war, KING \nALFRED never rested from his labours to improve his people.  He \nloved to talk with clever men, and with travellers from foreign \ncountries, and to write down what they told him, for his people to \nread.  He had studied Latin after learning to read English, and now \nanother of his labours was, to translate Latin books into the \nEnglish-Saxon tongue, that his people might be interested, and \nimproved by their contents.  He made just laws, that they might \nlive more happily and freely; he turned away all partial judges, \nthat no wrong might be done them; he was so careful of their \nproperty, and punished robbers so severely, that it was a common \nthing to say that under the great KING ALFRED, garlands of golden \nchains and jewels might have hung across the streets, and no man \nwould have touched one.  He founded schools; he patiently heard \ncauses himself in his Court of Justice; the great desires of his \nheart were, to do right to all his subjects, and to leave England \nbetter, wiser, happier in all ways, than he found it.  His industry \nin these efforts was quite astonishing.  Every day he divided into \ncertain portions, and in each portion devoted himself to a certain \npursuit.  That he might divide his time exactly, he had wax torches \nor candles made, which were all of the same size, were notched \nacross at regular distances, and were always kept burning.  Thus, \nas the candles burnt down, he divided the day into notches, almost \nas accurately as we now divide it into hours upon the clock.  But \nwhen the candles were first invented, it was found that the wind \nand draughts of air, blowing into the palace through the doors and \nwindows, and through the chinks in the walls, caused them to gutter \nand burn unequally.  To prevent this, the King had them put into \ncases formed of wood and white horn.  And these were the first \nlanthorns ever made in England.\n\nAll this time, he was afflicted with a terrible unknown disease, \nwhich caused him violent and frequent pain that nothing could \nrelieve.  He bore it, as he had borne all the troubles of his life, \nlike a brave good man, until he was fifty-three years old; and \nthen, having reigned thirty years, he died.  He died in the year \nnine hundred and one; but, long ago as that is, his fame, and the \nlove and gratitude with which his subjects regarded him, are \nfreshly remembered to the present hour.\n\nIn the next reign, which was the reign of EDWARD, surnamed THE \nELDER, who was chosen in council to succeed, a nephew of KING \nALFRED troubled the country by trying to obtain the throne.  The \nDanes in the East of England took part with this usurper (perhaps \nbecause they had honoured his uncle so much, and honoured him for \nhis uncle\'s sake), and there was hard fighting; but, the King, with \nthe assistance of his sister, gained the day, and reigned in peace \nfor four and twenty years.  He gradually extended his power over \nthe whole of England, and so the Seven Kingdoms were united into \none.\n\nWhen England thus became one kingdom, ruled over by one Saxon king, \nthe Saxons had been settled in the country more than four hundred \nand fifty years.  Great changes had taken place in its customs \nduring that time.  The Saxons were still greedy eaters and great \ndrinkers, and their feasts were often of a noisy and drunken kind; \nbut many new comforts and even elegances had become known, and were \nfast increasing.  Hangings for the walls of rooms, where, in these \nmodern days, we paste up paper, are known to have been sometimes \nmade of silk, ornamented with birds and flowers in needlework.  \nTables and chairs were curiously carved in different woods; were \nsometimes decorated with gold or silver; sometimes even made of \nthose precious metals.  Knives and spoons were used at table; \ngolden ornaments were worn - with silk and cloth, and golden \ntissues and embroideries; dishes were made of gold and silver, \nbrass and bone.  There were varieties of drinking-horns, bedsteads, \nmusical instruments.  A harp was passed round, at a feast, like the \ndrinking-bowl, from guest to guest; and each one usually sang or \nplayed when his turn came.  The weapons of the Saxons were stoutly \nmade, and among them was a terrible iron hammer that gave deadly \nblows, and was long remembered.  The Saxons themselves were a \nhandsome people.  The men were proud of their long fair hair, \nparted on the forehead; their ample beards, their fresh \ncomplexions, and clear eyes.  The beauty of the Saxon women filled \nall England with a new delight and grace.\n\nI have more to tell of the Saxons yet, but I stop to say this now, \nbecause under the GREAT ALFRED, all the best points of the English-\nSaxon character were first encouraged, and in him first shown.  It \nhas been the greatest character among the nations of the earth.  \nWherever the descendants of the Saxon race have gone, have sailed, \nor otherwise made their way, even to the remotest regions of the \nworld, they have been patient, persevering, never to be broken in \nspirit, never to be turned aside from enterprises on which they \nhave resolved.  In Europe, Asia, Africa, America, the whole world \nover; in the desert, in the forest, on the sea; scorched by a \nburning sun, or frozen by ice that never melts; the Saxon blood \nremains unchanged.  Wheresoever that race goes, there, law, and \nindustry, and safety for life and property, and all the great \nresults of steady perseverance, are certain to arise.\n\nI pause to think with admiration, of the noble king who, in his \nsingle person, possessed all the Saxon virtues.  Whom misfortune \ncould not subdue, whom prosperity could not spoil, whose \nperseverance nothing could shake.  Who was hopeful in defeat, and \ngenerous in success.  Who loved justice, freedom, truth, and \nknowledge.  Who, in his care to instruct his people, probably did \nmore to preserve the beautiful old Saxon language, than I can \nimagine.  Without whom, the English tongue in which I tell this \nstory might have wanted half its meaning.  As it is said that his \nspirit still inspires some of our best English laws, so, let you \nand I pray that it may animate our English hearts, at least to this \n- to resolve, when we see any of our fellow-creatures left in \nignorance, that we will do our best, while life is in us, to have \nthem taught; and to tell those rulers whose duty it is to teach \nthem, and who neglect their duty, that they have profited very \nlittle by all the years that have rolled away since the year nine \nhundred and one, and that they are far behind the bright example of \nKING ALFRED THE GREAT.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV - ENGLAND UNDER ATHELSTAN AND THE SIX BOY-KINGS\n\n\n\nATHELSTAN, the son of Edward the Elder, succeeded that king.  He \nreigned only fifteen years; but he remembered the glory of his \ngrandfather, the great Alfred, and governed England well.  He \nreduced the turbulent people of Wales, and obliged them to pay him \na tribute in money, and in cattle, and to send him their best hawks \nand hounds.  He was victorious over the Cornish men, who were not \nyet quite under the Saxon government.  He restored such of the old \nlaws as were good, and had fallen into disuse; made some wise new \nlaws, and took care of the poor and weak.  A strong alliance, made \nagainst him by ANLAF a Danish prince, CONSTANTINE King of the \nScots, and the people of North Wales, he broke and defeated in one \ngreat battle, long famous for the vast numbers slain in it.  After \nthat, he had a quiet reign; the lords and ladies about him had \nleisure to become polite and agreeable; and foreign princes were \nglad (as they have sometimes been since) to come to England on \nvisits to the English court.\n\nWhen Athelstan died, at forty-seven years old, his brother EDMUND, \nwho was only eighteen, became king.  He was the first of six boy-\nkings, as you will presently know.\n\nThey called him the Magnificent, because he showed a taste for \nimprovement and refinement.  But he was beset by the Danes, and had \na short and troubled reign, which came to a troubled end.  One \nnight, when he was feasting in his hall, and had eaten much and \ndrunk deep, he saw, among the company, a noted robber named LEOF, \nwho had been banished from England.  Made very angry by the \nboldness of this man, the King turned to his cup-bearer, and said, \n\'There is a robber sitting at the table yonder, who, for his \ncrimes, is an outlaw in the land - a hunted wolf, whose life any \nman may take, at any time.  Command that robber to depart!\'  \'I \nwill not depart!\' said Leof.  \'No?\' cried the King.  \'No, by the \nLord!\' said Leof.  Upon that the King rose from his seat, and, \nmaking passionately at the robber, and seizing him by his long \nhair, tried to throw him down.  But the robber had a dagger \nunderneath his cloak, and, in the scuffle, stabbed the King to \ndeath.  That done, he set his back against the wall, and fought so \ndesperately, that although he was soon cut to pieces by the King\'s \narmed men, and the wall and pavement were splashed with his blood, \nyet it was not before he had killed and wounded many of them.  You \nmay imagine what rough lives the kings of those times led, when one \nof them could struggle, half drunk, with a public robber in his own \ndining-hall, and be stabbed in presence of the company who ate and \ndrank with him.\n\nThen succeeded the boy-king EDRED, who was weak and sickly in body, \nbut of a strong mind.  And his armies fought the Northmen, the \nDanes, and Norwegians, or the Sea-Kings, as they were called, and \nbeat them for the time.  And, in nine years, Edred died, and passed \naway.\n\nThen came the boy-king EDWY, fifteen years of age; but the real \nking, who had the real power, was a monk named DUNSTAN - a clever \npriest, a little mad, and not a little proud and cruel.\n\nDunstan was then Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, whither the body of \nKing Edmund the Magnificent was carried, to be buried.  While yet a \nboy, he had got out of his bed one night (being then in a fever), \nand walked about Glastonbury Church when it was under repair; and, \nbecause he did not tumble off some scaffolds that were there, and \nbreak his neck, it was reported that he had been shown over the \nbuilding by an angel.  He had also made a harp that was said to \nplay of itself - which it very likely did, as AEolian Harps, which \nare played by the wind, and are understood now, always do.  For \nthese wonders he had been once denounced by his enemies, who were \njealous of his favour with the late King Athelstan, as a magician; \nand he had been waylaid, bound hand and foot, and thrown into a \nmarsh.  But he got out again, somehow, to cause a great deal of \ntrouble yet.\n\nThe priests of those days were, generally, the only scholars.  They \nwere learned in many things.  Having to make their own convents and \nmonasteries on uncultivated grounds that were granted to them by \nthe Crown, it was necessary that they should be good farmers and \ngood gardeners, or their lands would have been too poor to support \nthem.  For the decoration of the chapels where they prayed, and for \nthe comfort of the refectories where they ate and drank, it was \nnecessary that there should be good carpenters, good smiths, good \npainters, among them.  For their greater safety in sickness and \naccident, living alone by themselves in solitary places, it was \nnecessary that they should study the virtues of plants and herbs, \nand should know how to dress cuts, burns, scalds, and bruises, and \nhow to set broken limbs.  Accordingly, they taught themselves, and \none another, a great variety of useful arts; and became skilful in \nagriculture, medicine, surgery, and handicraft.  And when they \nwanted the aid of any little piece of machinery, which would be \nsimple enough now, but was marvellous then, to impose a trick upon \nthe poor peasants, they knew very well how to make it; and DID make \nit many a time and often, I have no doubt.\n\nDunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, was one of the most sagacious \nof these monks.  He was an ingenious smith, and worked at a forge \nin a little cell.  This cell was made too short to admit of his \nlying at full length when he went to sleep - as if THAT did any \ngood to anybody! - and he used to tell the most extraordinary lies \nabout demons and spirits, who, he said, came there to persecute \nhim.  For instance, he related that one day when he was at work, \nthe devil looked in at the little window, and tried to tempt him to \nlead a life of idle pleasure; whereupon, having his pincers in the \nfire, red hot, he seized the devil by the nose, and put him to such \npain, that his bellowings were heard for miles and miles.  Some \npeople are inclined to think this nonsense a part of Dunstan\'s \nmadness (for his head never quite recovered the fever), but I think \nnot.  I observe that it induced the ignorant people to consider him \na holy man, and that it made him very powerful.  Which was exactly \nwhat he always wanted.\n\nOn the day of the coronation of the handsome boy-king Edwy, it was \nremarked by ODO, Archbishop of Canterbury (who was a Dane by \nbirth), that the King quietly left the coronation feast, while all \nthe company were there.  Odo, much displeased, sent his friend \nDunstan to seek him.  Dunstan finding him in the company of his \nbeautiful young wife ELGIVA, and her mother ETHELGIVA, a good and \nvirtuous lady, not only grossly abused them, but dragged the young \nKing back into the feasting-hall by force.  Some, again, think \nDunstan did this because the young King\'s fair wife was his own \ncousin, and the monks objected to people marrying their own \ncousins; but I believe he did it, because he was an imperious, \naudacious, ill-conditioned priest, who, having loved a young lady \nhimself before he became a sour monk, hated all love now, and \neverything belonging to it.\n\nThe young King was quite old enough to feel this insult.  Dunstan \nhad been Treasurer in the last reign, and he soon charged Dunstan \nwith having taken some of the last king\'s money.  The Glastonbury \nAbbot fled to Belgium (very narrowly escaping some pursuers who \nwere sent to put out his eyes, as you will wish they had, when you \nread what follows), and his abbey was given to priests who were \nmarried; whom he always, both before and afterwards, opposed.  But \nhe quickly conspired with his friend, Odo the Dane, to set up the \nKing\'s young brother, EDGAR, as his rival for the throne; and, not \ncontent with this revenge, he caused the beautiful queen Elgiva, \nthough a lovely girl of only seventeen or eighteen, to be stolen \nfrom one of the Royal Palaces, branded in the cheek with a red-hot \niron, and sold into slavery in Ireland.  But the Irish people \npitied and befriended her; and they said, \'Let us restore the girl-\nqueen to the boy-king, and make the young lovers happy!\' and they \ncured her of her cruel wound, and sent her home as beautiful as \nbefore.  But the villain Dunstan, and that other villain, Odo, \ncaused her to be waylaid at Gloucester as she was joyfully hurrying \nto join her husband, and to be hacked and hewn with swords, and to \nbe barbarously maimed and lamed, and left to die.  When Edwy the \nFair (his people called him so, because he was so young and \nhandsome) heard of her dreadful fate, he died of a broken heart; \nand so the pitiful story of the poor young wife and husband ends!  \nAh!  Better to be two cottagers in these better times, than king \nand queen of England in those bad days, though never so fair!\n\nThen came the boy-king, EDGAR, called the Peaceful, fifteen years \nold.  Dunstan, being still the real king, drove all married priests \nout of the monasteries and abbeys, and replaced them by solitary \nmonks like himself, of the rigid order called the Benedictines.  He \nmade himself Archbishop of Canterbury, for his greater glory; and \nexercised such power over the neighbouring British princes, and so \ncollected them about the King, that once, when the King held his \ncourt at Chester, and went on the river Dee to visit the monastery \nof St. John, the eight oars of his boat were pulled (as the people \nused to delight in relating in stories and songs) by eight crowned \nkings, and steered by the King of England.  As Edgar was very \nobedient to Dunstan and the monks, they took great pains to \nrepresent him as the best of kings.  But he was really profligate, \ndebauched, and vicious.  He once forcibly carried off a young lady \nfrom the convent at Wilton; and Dunstan, pretending to be very much \nshocked, condemned him not to wear his crown upon his head for \nseven years - no great punishment, I dare say, as it can hardly \nhave been a more comfortable ornament to wear, than a stewpan \nwithout a handle.  His marriage with his second wife, ELFRIDA, is \none of the worst events of his reign.  Hearing of the beauty of \nthis lady, he despatched his favourite courtier, ATHELWOLD, to her \nfather\'s castle in Devonshire, to see if she were really as \ncharming as fame reported.  Now, she was so exceedingly beautiful \nthat Athelwold fell in love with her himself, and married her; but \nhe told the King that she was only rich - not handsome.  The King, \nsuspecting the truth when they came home, resolved to pay the \nnewly-married couple a visit; and, suddenly, told Athelwold to \nprepare for his immediate coming.  Athelwold, terrified, confessed \nto his young wife what he had said and done, and implored her to \ndisguise her beauty by some ugly dress or silly manner, that he \nmight be safe from the King\'s anger.  She promised that she would; \nbut she was a proud woman, who would far rather have been a queen \nthan the wife of a courtier.  She dressed herself in her best \ndress, and adorned herself with her richest jewels; and when the \nKing came, presently, he discovered the cheat.  So, he caused his \nfalse friend, Athelwold, to be murdered in a wood, and married his \nwidow, this bad Elfrida.  Six or seven years afterwards, he died; \nand was buried, as if he had been all that the monks said he was, \nin the abbey of Glastonbury, which he - or Dunstan for him - had \nmuch enriched.\n\nEngland, in one part of this reign, was so troubled by wolves, \nwhich, driven out of the open country, hid themselves in the \nmountains of Wales when they were not attacking travellers and \nanimals, that the tribute payable by the Welsh people was forgiven \nthem, on condition of their producing, every year, three hundred \nwolves\' heads.  And the Welshmen were so sharp upon the wolves, to \nsave their money, that in four years there was not a wolf left.\n\nThen came the boy-king, EDWARD, called the Martyr, from the manner \nof his death.  Elfrida had a son, named ETHELRED, for whom she \nclaimed the throne; but Dunstan did not choose to favour him, and \nhe made Edward king.  The boy was hunting, one day, down in \nDorsetshire, when he rode near to Corfe Castle, where Elfrida and \nEthelred lived.  Wishing to see them kindly, he rode away from his \nattendants and galloped to the castle gate, where he arrived at \ntwilight, and blew his hunting-horn.  \'You are welcome, dear King,\' \nsaid Elfrida, coming out, with her brightest smiles.  \'Pray you \ndismount and enter.\'  \'Not so, dear madam,\' said the King.  \'My \ncompany will miss me, and fear that I have met with some harm.  \nPlease you to give me a cup of wine, that I may drink here, in the \nsaddle, to you and to my little brother, and so ride away with the \ngood speed I have made in riding here.\'  Elfrida, going in to bring \nthe wine, whispered an armed servant, one of her attendants, who \nstole out of the darkening gateway, and crept round behind the \nKing\'s horse.  As the King raised the cup to his lips, saying, \n\'Health!\' to the wicked woman who was smiling on him, and to his \ninnocent brother whose hand she held in hers, and who was only ten \nyears old, this armed man made a spring and stabbed him in the \nback.  He dropped the cup and spurred his horse away; but, soon \nfainting with loss of blood, dropped from the saddle, and, in his \nfall, entangled one of his feet in the stirrup.  The frightened \nhorse dashed on; trailing his rider\'s curls upon the ground; \ndragging his smooth young face through ruts, and stones, and \nbriers, and fallen leaves, and mud; until the hunters, tracking the \nanimal\'s course by the King\'s blood, caught his bridle, and \nreleased the disfigured body.\n\nThen came the sixth and last of the boy-kings, ETHELRED, whom \nElfrida, when he cried out at the sight of his murdered brother \nriding away from the castle gate, unmercifully beat with a torch \nwhich she snatched from one of the attendants.  The people so \ndisliked this boy, on account of his cruel mother and the murder \nshe had done to promote him, that Dunstan would not have had him \nfor king, but would have made EDGITHA, the daughter of the dead \nKing Edgar, and of the lady whom he stole out of the convent at \nWilton, Queen of England, if she would have consented.  But she \nknew the stories of the youthful kings too well, and would not be \npersuaded from the convent where she lived in peace; so, Dunstan \nput Ethelred on the throne, having no one else to put there, and \ngave him the nickname of THE UNREADY - knowing that he wanted \nresolution and firmness.\n\nAt first, Elfrida possessed great influence over the young King, \nbut, as he grew older and came of age, her influence declined.  The \ninfamous woman, not having it in her power to do any more evil, \nthen retired from court, and, according, to the fashion of the \ntime, built churches and monasteries, to expiate her guilt.  As if \na church, with a steeple reaching to the very stars, would have \nbeen any sign of true repentance for the blood of the poor boy, \nwhose murdered form was trailed at his horse\'s heels!  As if she \ncould have buried her wickedness beneath the senseless stones of \nthe whole world, piled up one upon another, for the monks to live \nin!\n\nAbout the ninth or tenth year of this reign, Dunstan died.  He was \ngrowing old then, but was as stern and artful as ever.  Two \ncircumstances that happened in connexion with him, in this reign of \nEthelred, made a great noise.  Once, he was present at a meeting of \nthe Church, when the question was discussed whether priests should \nhave permission to marry; and, as he sat with his head hung down, \napparently thinking about it, a voice seemed to come out of a \ncrucifix in the room, and warn the meeting to be of his opinion.  \nThis was some juggling of Dunstan\'s, and was probably his own voice \ndisguised.  But he played off a worse juggle than that, soon \nafterwards; for, another meeting being held on the same subject, \nand he and his supporters being seated on one side of a great room, \nand their opponents on the other, he rose and said, \'To Christ \nhimself, as judge, do I commit this cause!\'  Immediately on these \nwords being spoken, the floor where the opposite party sat gave \nway, and some were killed and many wounded.  You may be pretty sure \nthat it had been weakened under Dunstan\'s direction, and that it \nfell at Dunstan\'s signal.  HIS part of the floor did not go down.  \nNo, no.  He was too good a workman for that.\n\nWhen he died, the monks settled that he was a Saint, and called him \nSaint Dunstan ever afterwards.  They might just as well have \nsettled that he was a coach-horse, and could just as easily have \ncalled him one.\n\nEthelred the Unready was glad enough, I dare say, to be rid of this \nholy saint; but, left to himself, he was a poor weak king, and his \nreign was a reign of defeat and shame.  The restless Danes, led by \nSWEYN, a son of the King of Denmark who had quarrelled with his \nfather and had been banished from home, again came into England, \nand, year after year, attacked and despoiled large towns.  To coax \nthese sea-kings away, the weak Ethelred paid them money; but, the \nmore money he paid, the more money the Danes wanted.  At first, he \ngave them ten thousand pounds; on their next invasion, sixteen \nthousand pounds; on their next invasion, four and twenty thousand \npounds:  to pay which large sums, the unfortunate English people \nwere heavily taxed.  But, as the Danes still came back and wanted \nmore, he thought it would be a good plan to marry into some \npowerful foreign family that would help him with soldiers.  So, in \nthe year one thousand and two, he courted and married Emma, the \nsister of Richard Duke of Normandy; a lady who was called the \nFlower of Normandy.\n\nAnd now, a terrible deed was done in England, the like of which was \nnever done on English ground before or since.  On the thirteenth of \nNovember, in pursuance of secret instructions sent by the King over \nthe whole country, the inhabitants of every town and city armed, \nand murdered all the Danes who were their neighbours.\n\nYoung and old, babies and soldiers, men and women, every Dane was \nkilled.  No doubt there were among them many ferocious men who had \ndone the English great wrong, and whose pride and insolence, in \nswaggering in the houses of the English and insulting their wives \nand daughters, had become unbearable; but no doubt there were also \namong them many peaceful Christian Danes who had married English \nwomen and become like English men.  They were all slain, even to \nGUNHILDA, the sister of the King of Denmark, married to an English \nlord; who was first obliged to see the murder of her husband and \nher child, and then was killed herself.\n\nWhen the King of the sea-kings heard of this deed of blood, he \nswore that he would have a great revenge.  He raised an army, and a \nmightier fleet of ships than ever yet had sailed to England; and in \nall his army there was not a slave or an old man, but every soldier \nwas a free man, and the son of a free man, and in the prime of \nlife, and sworn to be revenged upon the English nation, for the \nmassacre of that dread thirteenth of November, when his countrymen \nand countrywomen, and the little children whom they loved, were \nkilled with fire and sword.  And so, the sea-kings came to England \nin many great ships, each bearing the flag of its own commander.  \nGolden eagles, ravens, dragons, dolphins, beasts of prey, \nthreatened England from the prows of those ships, as they came \nonward through the water; and were reflected in the shining shields \nthat hung upon their sides.  The ship that bore the standard of the \nKing of the sea-kings was carved and painted like a mighty serpent; \nand the King in his anger prayed that the Gods in whom he trusted \nmight all desert him, if his serpent did not strike its fangs into \nEngland\'s heart.\n\nAnd indeed it did.  For, the great army landing from the great \nfleet, near Exeter, went forward, laying England waste, and \nstriking their lances in the earth as they advanced, or throwing \nthem into rivers, in token of their making all the island theirs.  \nIn remembrance of the black November night when the Danes were \nmurdered, wheresoever the invaders came, they made the Saxons \nprepare and spread for them great feasts; and when they had eaten \nthose feasts, and had drunk a curse to England with wild \nrejoicings, they drew their swords, and killed their Saxon \nentertainers, and marched on.  For six long years they carried on \nthis war:  burning the crops, farmhouses, barns, mills, granaries; \nkilling the labourers in the fields; preventing the seed from being \nsown in the ground; causing famine and starvation; leaving only \nheaps of ruin and smoking ashes, where they had found rich towns.  \nTo crown this misery, English officers and men deserted, and even \nthe favourites of Ethelred the Unready, becoming traitors, seized \nmany of the English ships, turned pirates against their own \ncountry, and aided by a storm occasioned the loss of nearly the \nwhole English navy.\n\nThere was but one man of note, at this miserable pass, who was true \nto his country and the feeble King.  He was a priest, and a brave \none.  For twenty days, the Archbishop of Canterbury defended that \ncity against its Danish besiegers; and when a traitor in the town \nthrew the gates open and admitted them, he said, in chains, \'I will \nnot buy my life with money that must be extorted from the suffering \npeople.  Do with me what you please!\'  Again and again, he steadily \nrefused to purchase his release with gold wrung from the poor.\n\nAt last, the Danes being tired of this, and being assembled at a \ndrunken merry-making, had him brought into the feasting-hall.\n\n\'Now, bishop,\' they said, \'we want gold!\'\n\nHe looked round on the crowd of angry faces; from the shaggy beards \nclose to him, to the shaggy beards against the walls, where men \nwere mounted on tables and forms to see him over the heads of \nothers:  and he knew that his time was come.\n\n\'I have no gold,\' he said.\n\n\'Get it, bishop!\' they all thundered.\n\n\'That, I have often told you I will not,\' said he.\n\nThey gathered closer round him, threatening, but he stood unmoved.  \nThen, one man struck him; then, another; then a cursing soldier \npicked up from a heap in a corner of the hall, where fragments had \nbeen rudely thrown at dinner, a great ox-bone, and cast it at his \nface, from which the blood came spurting forth; then, others ran to \nthe same heap, and knocked him down with other bones, and bruised \nand battered him; until one soldier whom he had baptised (willing, \nas I hope for the sake of that soldier\'s soul, to shorten the \nsufferings of the good man) struck him dead with his battle-axe.\n\nIf Ethelred had had the heart to emulate the courage of this noble \narchbishop, he might have done something yet.  But he paid the \nDanes forty-eight thousand pounds, instead, and gained so little by \nthe cowardly act, that Sweyn soon afterwards came over to subdue \nall England.  So broken was the attachment of the English people, \nby this time, to their incapable King and their forlorn country \nwhich could not protect them, that they welcomed Sweyn on all \nsides, as a deliverer.  London faithfully stood out, as long as the \nKing was within its walls; but, when he sneaked away, it also \nwelcomed the Dane.  Then, all was over; and the King took refuge \nabroad with the Duke of Normandy, who had already given shelter to \nthe King\'s wife, once the Flower of that country, and to her \nchildren.\n\nStill, the English people, in spite of their sad sufferings, could \nnot quite forget the great King Alfred and the Saxon race.  When \nSweyn died suddenly, in little more than a month after he had been \nproclaimed King of England, they generously sent to Ethelred, to \nsay that they would have him for their King again, \'if he would \nonly govern them better than he had governed them before.\'  The \nUnready, instead of coming himself, sent Edward, one of his sons, \nto make promises for him.  At last, he followed, and the English \ndeclared him King.  The Danes declared CANUTE, the son of Sweyn, \nKing.  Thus, direful war began again, and lasted for three years, \nwhen the Unready died.  And I know of nothing better that he did, \nin all his reign of eight and thirty years.\n\nWas Canute to be King now?  Not over the Saxons, they said; they \nmust have EDMUND, one of the sons of the Unready, who was surnamed \nIRONSIDE, because of his strength and stature.  Edmund and Canute \nthereupon fell to, and fought five battles - O unhappy England, \nwhat a fighting-ground it was! - and then Ironside, who was a big \nman, proposed to Canute, who was a little man, that they two should \nfight it out in single combat.  If Canute had been the big man, he \nwould probably have said yes, but, being the little man, he \ndecidedly said no.  However, he declared that he was willing to \ndivide the kingdom - to take all that lay north of Watling Street, \nas the old Roman military road from Dover to Chester was called, \nand to give Ironside all that lay south of it.  Most men being \nweary of so much bloodshed, this was done.  But Canute soon became \nsole King of England; for Ironside died suddenly within two months.  \nSome think that he was killed, and killed by Canute\'s orders.  No \none knows.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V - ENGLAND UNDER CANUTE THE DANE\n\n\n\nCANUTE reigned eighteen years.  He was a merciless King at first.  \nAfter he had clasped the hands of the Saxon chiefs, in token of the \nsincerity with which he swore to be just and good to them in return \nfor their acknowledging him, he denounced and slew many of them, as \nwell as many relations of the late King.  \'He who brings me the \nhead of one of my enemies,\' he used to say, \'shall be dearer to me \nthan a brother.\'  And he was so severe in hunting down his enemies, \nthat he must have got together a pretty large family of these dear \nbrothers.  He was strongly inclined to kill EDMUND and EDWARD, two \nchildren, sons of poor Ironside; but, being afraid to do so in \nEngland, he sent them over to the King of Sweden, with a request \nthat the King would be so good as \'dispose of them.\'  If the King \nof Sweden had been like many, many other men of that day, he would \nhave had their innocent throats cut; but he was a kind man, and \nbrought them up tenderly.\n\nNormandy ran much in Canute\'s mind.  In Normandy were the two \nchildren of the late king - EDWARD and ALFRED by name; and their \nuncle the Duke might one day claim the crown for them.  But the \nDuke showed so little inclination to do so now, that he proposed to \nCanute to marry his sister, the widow of The Unready; who, being \nbut a showy flower, and caring for nothing so much as becoming a \nqueen again, left her children and was wedded to him.\n\nSuccessful and triumphant, assisted by the valour of the English in \nhis foreign wars, and with little strife to trouble him at home, \nCanute had a prosperous reign, and made many improvements.  He was \na poet and a musician.  He grew sorry, as he grew older, for the \nblood he had shed at first; and went to Rome in a Pilgrim\'s dress, \nby way of washing it out.  He gave a great deal of money to \nforeigners on his journey; but he took it from the English before \nhe started.  On the whole, however, he certainly became a far \nbetter man when he had no opposition to contend with, and was as \ngreat a King as England had known for some time.\n\nThe old writers of history relate how that Canute was one day \ndisgusted with his courtiers for their flattery, and how he caused \nhis chair to be set on the sea-shore, and feigned to command the \ntide as it came up not to wet the edge of his robe, for the land \nwas his; how the tide came up, of course, without regarding him; \nand how he then turned to his flatterers, and rebuked them, saying, \nwhat was the might of any earthly king, to the might of the \nCreator, who could say unto the sea, \'Thus far shalt thou go, and \nno farther!\'  We may learn from this, I think, that a little sense \nwill go a long way in a king; and that courtiers are not easily \ncured of flattery, nor kings of a liking for it.  If the courtiers \nof Canute had not known, long before, that the King was fond of \nflattery, they would have known better than to offer it in such \nlarge doses.  And if they had not known that he was vain of this \nspeech (anything but a wonderful speech it seems to me, if a good \nchild had made it), they would not have been at such great pains to \nrepeat it.  I fancy I see them all on the sea-shore together; the \nKing\'s chair sinking in the sand; the King in a mighty good humour \nwith his own wisdom; and the courtiers pretending to be quite \nstunned by it!\n\nIt is not the sea alone that is bidden to go \'thus far, and no \nfarther.\'  The great command goes forth to all the kings upon the \nearth, and went to Canute in the year one thousand and thirty-five, \nand stretched him dead upon his bed.  Beside it, stood his Norman \nwife.  Perhaps, as the King looked his last upon her, he, who had \nso often thought distrustfully of Normandy, long ago, thought once \nmore of the two exiled Princes in their uncle\'s court, and of the \nlittle favour they could feel for either Danes or Saxons, and of a \nrising cloud in Normandy that slowly moved towards England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI - ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD HAREFOOT, HARDICANUTE, AND EDWARD \nTHE CONFESSOR\n\n\n\nCANUTE left three sons, by name SWEYN, HAROLD, and HARDICANUTE; but \nhis Queen, Emma, once the Flower of Normandy, was the mother of \nonly Hardicanute.  Canute had wished his dominions to be divided \nbetween the three, and had wished Harold to have England; but the \nSaxon people in the South of England, headed by a nobleman with \ngreat possessions, called the powerful EARL GODWIN (who is said to \nhave been originally a poor cow-boy), opposed this, and desired to \nhave, instead, either Hardicanute, or one of the two exiled Princes \nwho were over in Normandy.  It seemed so certain that there would \nbe more bloodshed to settle this dispute, that many people left \ntheir homes, and took refuge in the woods and swamps.  Happily, \nhowever, it was agreed to refer the whole question to a great \nmeeting at Oxford, which decided that Harold should have all the \ncountry north of the Thames, with London for his capital city, and \nthat Hardicanute should have all the south.  The quarrel was so \narranged; and, as Hardicanute was in Denmark troubling himself very \nlittle about anything but eating and getting drunk, his mother and \nEarl Godwin governed the south for him.\n\nThey had hardly begun to do so, and the trembling people who had \nhidden themselves were scarcely at home again, when Edward, the \nelder of the two exiled Princes, came over from Normandy with a few \nfollowers, to claim the English Crown.  His mother Emma, however, \nwho only cared for her last son Hardicanute, instead of assisting \nhim, as he expected, opposed him so strongly with all her influence \nthat he was very soon glad to get safely back.  His brother Alfred \nwas not so fortunate.  Believing in an affectionate letter, written \nsome time afterwards to him and his brother, in his mother\'s name \n(but whether really with or without his mother\'s knowledge is now \nuncertain), he allowed himself to be tempted over to England, with \na good force of soldiers, and landing on the Kentish coast, and \nbeing met and welcomed by Earl Godwin, proceeded into Surrey, as \nfar as the town of Guildford.  Here, he and his men halted in the \nevening to rest, having still the Earl in their company; who had \nordered lodgings and good cheer for them.  But, in the dead of the \nnight, when they were off their guard, being divided into small \nparties sleeping soundly after a long march and a plentiful supper \nin different houses, they were set upon by the King\'s troops, and \ntaken prisoners.  Next morning they were drawn out in a line, to \nthe number of six hundred men, and were barbarously tortured and \nkilled; with the exception of every tenth man, who was sold into \nslavery.  As to the wretched Prince Alfred, he was stripped naked, \ntied to a horse and sent away into the Isle of Ely, where his eyes \nwere torn out of his head, and where in a few days he miserably \ndied.  I am not sure that the Earl had wilfully entrapped him, but \nI suspect it strongly.\n\nHarold was now King all over England, though it is doubtful whether \nthe Archbishop of Canterbury (the greater part of the priests were \nSaxons, and not friendly to the Danes) ever consented to crown him.  \nCrowned or uncrowned, with the Archbishop\'s leave or without it, he \nwas King for four years:  after which short reign he died, and was \nburied; having never done much in life but go a hunting.  He was \nsuch a fast runner at this, his favourite sport, that the people \ncalled him Harold Harefoot.\n\nHardicanute was then at Bruges, in Flanders, plotting, with his \nmother (who had gone over there after the cruel murder of Prince \nAlfred), for the invasion of England.  The Danes and Saxons, \nfinding themselves without a King, and dreading new disputes, made \ncommon cause, and joined in inviting him to occupy the Throne.  He \nconsented, and soon troubled them enough; for he brought over \nnumbers of Danes, and taxed the people so insupportably to enrich \nthose greedy favourites that there were many insurrections, \nespecially one at Worcester, where the citizens rose and killed his \ntax-collectors; in revenge for which he burned their city.  He was \na brutal King, whose first public act was to order the dead body of \npoor Harold Harefoot to be dug up, beheaded, and thrown into the \nriver.  His end was worthy of such a beginning.  He fell down \ndrunk, with a goblet of wine in his hand, at a wedding-feast at \nLambeth, given in honour of the marriage of his standard-bearer, a \nDane named TOWED THE PROUD.  And he never spoke again.\n\nEDWARD, afterwards called by the monks THE CONFESSOR, succeeded; \nand his first act was to oblige his mother Emma, who had favoured \nhim so little, to retire into the country; where she died some ten \nyears afterwards.  He was the exiled prince whose brother Alfred \nhad been so foully killed.  He had been invited over from Normandy \nby Hardicanute, in the course of his short reign of two years, and \nhad been handsomely treated at court.  His cause was now favoured \nby the powerful Earl Godwin, and he was soon made King.  This Earl \nhad been suspected by the people, ever since Prince Alfred\'s cruel \ndeath; he had even been tried in the last reign for the Prince\'s \nmurder, but had been pronounced not guilty; chiefly, as it was \nsupposed, because of a present he had made to the swinish King, of \na gilded ship with a figure-head of solid gold, and a crew of \neighty splendidly armed men.  It was his interest to help the new \nKing with his power, if the new King would help him against the \npopular distrust and hatred.  So they made a bargain.  Edward the \nConfessor got the Throne.  The Earl got more power and more land, \nand his daughter Editha was made queen; for it was a part of their \ncompact that the King should take her for his wife.\n\nBut, although she was a gentle lady, in all things worthy to be \nbeloved - good, beautiful, sensible, and kind - the King from the \nfirst neglected her.  Her father and her six proud brothers, \nresenting this cold treatment, harassed the King greatly by \nexerting all their power to make him unpopular.  Having lived so \nlong in Normandy, he preferred the Normans to the English.  He made \na Norman Archbishop, and Norman Bishops; his great officers and \nfavourites were all Normans; he introduced the Norman fashions and \nthe Norman language; in imitation of the state custom of Normandy, \nhe attached a great seal to his state documents, instead of merely \nmarking them, as the Saxon Kings had done, with the sign of the \ncross - just as poor people who have never been taught to write, \nnow make the same mark for their names.  All this, the powerful \nEarl Godwin and his six proud sons represented to the people as \ndisfavour shown towards the English; and thus they daily increased \ntheir own power, and daily diminished the power of the King.\n\nThey were greatly helped by an event that occurred when he had \nreigned eight years.  Eustace, Earl of Bologne, who had married the \nKing\'s sister, came to England on a visit.  After staying at the \ncourt some time, he set forth, with his numerous train of \nattendants, to return home.  They were to embark at Dover.  \nEntering that peaceful town in armour, they took possession of the \nbest houses, and noisily demanded to be lodged and entertained \nwithout payment.  One of the bold men of Dover, who would not \nendure to have these domineering strangers jingling their heavy \nswords and iron corselets up and down his house, eating his meat \nand drinking his strong liquor, stood in his doorway and refused \nadmission to the first armed man who came there.  The armed man \ndrew, and wounded him.  The man of Dover struck the armed man dead.  \nIntelligence of what he had done, spreading through the streets to \nwhere the Count Eustace and his men were standing by their horses, \nbridle in hand, they passionately mounted, galloped to the house, \nsurrounded it, forced their way in (the doors and windows being \nclosed when they came up), and killed the man of Dover at his own \nfireside.  They then clattered through the streets, cutting down \nand riding over men, women, and children.  This did not last long, \nyou may believe.  The men of Dover set upon them with great fury, \nkilled nineteen of the foreigners, wounded many more, and, \nblockading the road to the port so that they should not embark, \nbeat them out of the town by the way they had come.  Hereupon, \nCount Eustace rides as hard as man can ride to Gloucester, where \nEdward is, surrounded by Norman monks and Norman lords.  \'Justice!\' \ncries the Count, \'upon the men of Dover, who have set upon and \nslain my people!\'  The King sends immediately for the powerful Earl \nGodwin, who happens to be near; reminds him that Dover is under his \ngovernment; and orders him to repair to Dover and do military \nexecution on the inhabitants.  \'It does not become you,\' says the \nproud Earl in reply, \'to condemn without a hearing those whom you \nhave sworn to protect.  I will not do it.\'\n\nThe King, therefore, summoned the Earl, on pain of banishment and \nloss of his titles and property, to appear before the court to \nanswer this disobedience.  The Earl refused to appear.  He, his \neldest son Harold, and his second son Sweyn, hastily raised as many \nfighting men as their utmost power could collect, and demanded to \nhave Count Eustace and his followers surrendered to the justice of \nthe country.  The King, in his turn, refused to give them up, and \nraised a strong force.  After some treaty and delay, the troops of \nthe great Earl and his sons began to fall off.  The Earl, with a \npart of his family and abundance of treasure, sailed to Flanders; \nHarold escaped to Ireland; and the power of the great family was \nfor that time gone in England.  But, the people did not forget \nthem.\n\nThen, Edward the Confessor, with the true meanness of a mean \nspirit, visited his dislike of the once powerful father and sons \nupon the helpless daughter and sister, his unoffending wife, whom \nall who saw her (her husband and his monks excepted) loved.  He \nseized rapaciously upon her fortune and her jewels, and allowing \nher only one attendant, confined her in a gloomy convent, of which \na sister of his - no doubt an unpleasant lady after his own heart - \nwas abbess or jailer.\n\nHaving got Earl Godwin and his six sons well out of his way, the \nKing favoured the Normans more than ever.  He invited over WILLIAM, \nDUKE OF NORMANDY, the son of that Duke who had received him and his \nmurdered brother long ago, and of a peasant girl, a tanner\'s \ndaughter, with whom that Duke had fallen in love for her beauty as \nhe saw her washing clothes in a brook.  William, who was a great \nwarrior, with a passion for fine horses, dogs, and arms, accepted \nthe invitation; and the Normans in England, finding themselves more \nnumerous than ever when he arrived with his retinue, and held in \nstill greater honour at court than before, became more and more \nhaughty towards the people, and were more and more disliked by \nthem.\n\nThe old Earl Godwin, though he was abroad, knew well how the people \nfelt; for, with part of the treasure he had carried away with him, \nhe kept spies and agents in his pay all over England.\n\nAccordingly, he thought the time was come for fitting out a great \nexpedition against the Norman-loving King.  With it, he sailed to \nthe Isle of Wight, where he was joined by his son Harold, the most \ngallant and brave of all his family.  And so the father and son \ncame sailing up the Thames to Southwark; great numbers of the \npeople declaring for them, and shouting for the English Earl and \nthe English Harold, against the Norman favourites!\n\nThe King was at first as blind and stubborn as kings usually have \nbeen whensoever they have been in the hands of monks.  But the \npeople rallied so thickly round the old Earl and his son, and the \nold Earl was so steady in demanding without bloodshed the \nrestoration of himself and his family to their rights, that at last \nthe court took the alarm.  The Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, and \nthe Norman Bishop of London, surrounded by their retainers, fought \ntheir way out of London, and escaped from Essex to France in a \nfishing-boat.  The other Norman favourites dispersed in all \ndirections.  The old Earl and his sons (except Sweyn, who had \ncommitted crimes against the law) were restored to their \npossessions and dignities.  Editha, the virtuous and lovely Queen \nof the insensible King, was triumphantly released from her prison, \nthe convent, and once more sat in her chair of state, arrayed in \nthe jewels of which, when she had no champion to support her \nrights, her cold-blooded husband had deprived her.\n\nThe old Earl Godwin did not long enjoy his restored fortune.  He \nfell down in a fit at the King\'s table, and died upon the third day \nafterwards.  Harold succeeded to his power, and to a far higher \nplace in the attachment of the people than his father had ever \nheld.  By his valour he subdued the King\'s enemies in many bloody \nfights.  He was vigorous against rebels in Scotland - this was the \ntime when Macbeth slew Duncan, upon which event our English \nShakespeare, hundreds of years afterwards, wrote his great tragedy; \nand he killed the restless Welsh King GRIFFITH, and brought his \nhead to England.\n\nWhat Harold was doing at sea, when he was driven on the French \ncoast by a tempest, is not at all certain; nor does it at all \nmatter.  That his ship was forced by a storm on that shore, and \nthat he was taken prisoner, there is no doubt.  In those barbarous \ndays, all shipwrecked strangers were taken prisoners, and obliged \nto pay ransom.  So, a certain Count Guy, who was the Lord of \nPonthieu where Harold\'s disaster happened, seized him, instead of \nrelieving him like a hospitable and Christian lord as he ought to \nhave done, and expected to make a very good thing of it.\n\nBut Harold sent off immediately to Duke William of Normandy, \ncomplaining of this treatment; and the Duke no sooner heard of it \nthan he ordered Harold to be escorted to the ancient town of Rouen, \nwhere he then was, and where he received him as an honoured guest.  \nNow, some writers tell us that Edward the Confessor, who was by \nthis time old and had no children, had made a will, appointing Duke \nWilliam of Normandy his successor, and had informed the Duke of his \nhaving done so.  There is no doubt that he was anxious about his \nsuccessor; because he had even invited over, from abroad, EDWARD \nTHE OUTLAW, a son of Ironside, who had come to England with his \nwife and three children, but whom the King had strangely refused to \nsee when he did come, and who had died in London suddenly (princes \nwere terribly liable to sudden death in those days), and had been \nburied in St. Paul\'s Cathedral.  The King might possibly have made \nsuch a will; or, having always been fond of the Normans, he might \nhave encouraged Norman William to aspire to the English crown, by \nsomething that he said to him when he was staying at the English \ncourt.  But, certainly William did now aspire to it; and knowing \nthat Harold would be a powerful rival, he called together a great \nassembly of his nobles, offered Harold his daughter ADELE in \nmarriage, informed him that he meant on King Edward\'s death to \nclaim the English crown as his own inheritance, and required Harold \nthen and there to swear to aid him.  Harold, being in the Duke\'s \npower, took this oath upon the Missal, or Prayer-book.  It is a \ngood example of the superstitions of the monks, that this Missal, \ninstead of being placed upon a table, was placed upon a tub; which, \nwhen Harold had sworn, was uncovered, and shown to be full of dead \nmen\'s bones - bones, as the monks pretended, of saints.  This was \nsupposed to make Harold\'s oath a great deal more impressive and \nbinding.  As if the great name of the Creator of Heaven and earth \ncould be made more solemn by a knuckle-bone, or a double-tooth, or \na finger-nail, of Dunstan!\n\nWithin a week or two after Harold\'s return to England, the dreary \nold Confessor was found to be dying.  After wandering in his mind \nlike a very weak old man, he died.  As he had put himself entirely \nin the hands of the monks when he was alive, they praised him \nlustily when he was dead.  They had gone so far, already, as to \npersuade him that he could work miracles; and had brought people \nafflicted with a bad disorder of the skin, to him, to be touched \nand cured.  This was called \'touching for the King\'s Evil,\' which \nafterwards became a royal custom.  You know, however, Who really \ntouched the sick, and healed them; and you know His sacred name is \nnot among the dusty line of human kings.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII - ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD THE SECOND, AND CONQUERED BY THE \nNORMANS\n\n\n\nHAROLD was crowned King of England on the very day of the maudlin \nConfessor\'s funeral.  He had good need to be quick about it.  When \nthe news reached Norman William, hunting in his park at Rouen, he \ndropped his bow, returned to his palace, called his nobles to \ncouncil, and presently sent ambassadors to Harold, calling on him \nto keep his oath and resign the Crown.  Harold would do no such \nthing.  The barons of France leagued together round Duke William \nfor the invasion of England.  Duke William promised freely to \ndistribute English wealth and English lands among them.  The Pope \nsent to Normandy a consecrated banner, and a ring containing a hair \nwhich he warranted to have grown on the head of Saint Peter.  He \nblessed the enterprise; and cursed Harold; and requested that the \nNormans would pay \'Peter\'s Pence\' - or a tax to himself of a penny \na year on every house - a little more regularly in future, if they \ncould make it convenient.\n\nKing Harold had a rebel brother in Flanders, who was a vassal of \nHAROLD HARDRADA, King of Norway.  This brother, and this Norwegian \nKing, joining their forces against England, with Duke William\'s \nhelp, won a fight in which the English were commanded by two \nnobles; and then besieged York.  Harold, who was waiting for the \nNormans on the coast at Hastings, with his army, marched to \nStamford Bridge upon the river Derwent to give them instant battle.\n\nHe found them drawn up in a hollow circle, marked out by their \nshining spears.  Riding round this circle at a distance, to survey \nit, he saw a brave figure on horseback, in a blue mantle and a \nbright helmet, whose horse suddenly stumbled and threw him.\n\n\'Who is that man who has fallen?\' Harold asked of one of his \ncaptains.\n\n\'The King of Norway,\' he replied.\n\n\'He is a tall and stately king,\' said Harold, \'but his end is \nnear.\'\n\nHe added, in a little while, \'Go yonder to my brother, and tell \nhim, if he withdraw his troops, he shall be Earl of Northumberland, \nand rich and powerful in England.\'\n\nThe captain rode away and gave the message.\n\n\'What will he give to my friend the King of Norway?\' asked the \nbrother.\n\n\'Seven feet of earth for a grave,\' replied the captain.\n\n\'No more?\' returned the brother, with a smile.\n\n\'The King of Norway being a tall man, perhaps a little more,\' \nreplied the captain.\n\n\'Ride back!\' said the brother, \'and tell King Harold to make ready \nfor the fight!\'\n\nHe did so, very soon.  And such a fight King Harold led against \nthat force, that his brother, and the Norwegian King, and every \nchief of note in all their host, except the Norwegian King\'s son, \nOlave, to whom he gave honourable dismissal, were left dead upon \nthe field.  The victorious army marched to York.  As King Harold \nsat there at the feast, in the midst of all his company, a stir was \nheard at the doors; and messengers all covered with mire from \nriding far and fast through broken ground came hurrying in, to \nreport that the Normans had landed in England.\n\nThe intelligence was true.  They had been tossed about by contrary \nwinds, and some of their ships had been wrecked.  A part of their \nown shore, to which they had been driven back, was strewn with \nNorman bodies.  But they had once more made sail, led by the Duke\'s \nown galley, a present from his wife, upon the prow whereof the \nfigure of a golden boy stood pointing towards England.  By day, the \nbanner of the three Lions of Normandy, the diverse coloured sails, \nthe gilded vans, the many decorations of this gorgeous ship, had \nglittered in the sun and sunny water; by night, a light had \nsparkled like a star at her mast-head.  And now, encamped near \nHastings, with their leader lying in the old Roman castle of \nPevensey, the English retiring in all directions, the land for \nmiles around scorched and smoking, fired and pillaged, was the \nwhole Norman power, hopeful and strong on English ground.\n\nHarold broke up the feast and hurried to London.  Within a week, \nhis army was ready.  He sent out spies to ascertain the Norman \nstrength.  William took them, caused them to be led through his \nwhole camp, and then dismissed.  \'The Normans,\' said these spies to \nHarold, \'are not bearded on the upper lip as we English are, but \nare shorn.  They are priests.\'  \'My men,\' replied Harold, with a \nlaugh, \'will find those priests good soldiers!\'\n\n\'The Saxons,\' reported Duke William\'s outposts of Norman soldiers, \nwho were instructed to retire as King Harold\'s army advanced, \'rush \non us through their pillaged country with the fury of madmen.\'\n\n\'Let them come, and come soon!\' said Duke William.\n\nSome proposals for a reconciliation were made, but were soon \nabandoned.  In the middle of the month of October, in the year one \nthousand and sixty-six, the Normans and the English came front to \nfront.  All night the armies lay encamped before each other, in a \npart of the country then called Senlac, now called (in remembrance \nof them) Battle.  With the first dawn of day, they arose.  There, \nin the faint light, were the English on a hill; a wood behind them; \nin their midst, the Royal banner, representing a fighting warrior, \nwoven in gold thread, adorned with precious stones; beneath the \nbanner, as it rustled in the wind, stood King Harold on foot, with \ntwo of his remaining brothers by his side; around them, still and \nsilent as the dead, clustered the whole English army - every \nsoldier covered by his shield, and bearing in his hand his dreaded \nEnglish battle-axe.\n\nOn an opposite hill, in three lines, archers, foot-soldiers, \nhorsemen, was the Norman force.  Of a sudden, a great battle-cry, \n\'God help us!\' burst from the Norman lines.  The English answered \nwith their own battle-cry, \'God\'s Rood!  Holy Rood!\'  The Normans \nthen came sweeping down the hill to attack the English.\n\nThere was one tall Norman Knight who rode before the Norman army on \na prancing horse, throwing up his heavy sword and catching it, and \nsinging of the bravery of his countrymen.  An English Knight, who \nrode out from the English force to meet him, fell by this Knight\'s \nhand.  Another English Knight rode out, and he fell too.  But then \na third rode out, and killed the Norman.  This was in the first \nbeginning of the fight.  It soon raged everywhere.\n\nThe English, keeping side by side in a great mass, cared no more \nfor the showers of Norman arrows than if they had been showers of \nNorman rain.  When the Norman horsemen rode against them, with \ntheir battle-axes they cut men and horses down.  The Normans gave \nway.  The English pressed forward.  A cry went forth among the \nNorman troops that Duke William was killed.  Duke William took off \nhis helmet, in order that his face might be distinctly seen, and \nrode along the line before his men.  This gave them courage.  As \nthey turned again to face the English, some of their Norman horse \ndivided the pursuing body of the English from the rest, and thus \nall that foremost portion of the English army fell, fighting \nbravely.  The main body still remaining firm, heedless of the \nNorman arrows, and with their battle-axes cutting down the crowds \nof horsemen when they rode up, like forests of young trees, Duke \nWilliam pretended to retreat.  The eager English followed.  The \nNorman army closed again, and fell upon them with great slaughter.\n\n\'Still,\' said Duke William, \'there are thousands of the English, \nfirms as rocks around their King.  Shoot upward, Norman archers, \nthat your arrows may fall down upon their faces!\'\n\nThe sun rose high, and sank, and the battle still raged.  Through \nall the wild October day, the clash and din resounded in the air.  \nIn the red sunset, and in the white moonlight, heaps upon heaps of \ndead men lay strewn, a dreadful spectacle, all over the ground.\n\nKing Harold, wounded with an arrow in the eye, was nearly blind.  \nHis brothers were already killed.  Twenty Norman Knights, whose \nbattered armour had flashed fiery and golden in the sunshine all \nday long, and now looked silvery in the moonlight, dashed forward \nto seize the Royal banner from the English Knights and soldiers, \nstill faithfully collected round their blinded King.  The King \nreceived a mortal wound, and dropped.  The English broke and fled.  \nThe Normans rallied, and the day was lost.\n\nO what a sight beneath the moon and stars, when lights were shining \nin the tent of the victorious Duke William, which was pitched near \nthe spot where Harold fell - and he and his knights were carousing, \nwithin - and soldiers with torches, going slowly to and fro, \nwithout, sought for the corpse of Harold among piles of dead - and \nthe Warrior, worked in golden thread and precious stones, lay low, \nall torn and soiled with blood - and the three Norman Lions kept \nwatch over the field!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII - ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE FIRST, THE NORMAN \nCONQUEROR\n\n\n\nUPON the ground where the brave Harold fell, William the Norman \nafterwards founded an abbey, which, under the name of Battle Abbey, \nwas a rich and splendid place through many a troubled year, though \nnow it is a grey ruin overgrown with ivy.  But the first work he \nhad to do, was to conquer the English thoroughly; and that, as you \nknow by this time, was hard work for any man.\n\nHe ravaged several counties; he burned and plundered many towns; he \nlaid waste scores upon scores of miles of pleasant country; he \ndestroyed innumerable lives.  At length STIGAND, Archbishop of \nCanterbury, with other representatives of the clergy and the \npeople, went to his camp, and submitted to him.  EDGAR, the \ninsignificant son of Edmund Ironside, was proclaimed King by \nothers, but nothing came of it.  He fled to Scotland afterwards, \nwhere his sister, who was young and beautiful, married the Scottish \nKing.  Edgar himself was not important enough for anybody to care \nmuch about him.\n\nOn Christmas Day, William was crowned in Westminster Abbey, under \nthe title of WILLIAM THE FIRST; but he is best known as WILLIAM THE \nCONQUEROR.  It was a strange coronation.  One of the bishops who \nperformed the ceremony asked the Normans, in French, if they would \nhave Duke William for their king?  They answered Yes.  Another of \nthe bishops put the same question to the Saxons, in English.  They \ntoo answered Yes, with a loud shout.  The noise being heard by a \nguard of Norman horse-soldiers outside, was mistaken for resistance \non the part of the English.  The guard instantly set fire to the \nneighbouring houses, and a tumult ensued; in the midst of which the \nKing, being left alone in the Abbey, with a few priests (and they \nall being in a terrible fright together), was hurriedly crowned.  \nWhen the crown was placed upon his head, he swore to govern the \nEnglish as well as the best of their own monarchs.  I dare say you \nthink, as I do, that if we except the Great Alfred, he might pretty \neasily have done that.\n\nNumbers of the English nobles had been killed in the last \ndisastrous battle.  Their estates, and the estates of all the \nnobles who had fought against him there, King William seized upon, \nand gave to his own Norman knights and nobles.  Many great English \nfamilies of the present time acquired their English lands in this \nway, and are very proud of it.\n\nBut what is got by force must be maintained by force.  These nobles \nwere obliged to build castles all over England, to defend their new \nproperty; and, do what he would, the King could neither soothe nor \nquell the nation as he wished.  He gradually introduced the Norman \nlanguage and the Norman customs; yet, for a long time the great \nbody of the English remained sullen and revengeful.  On his going \nover to Normandy, to visit his subjects there, the oppressions of \nhis half-brother ODO, whom he left in charge of his English \nkingdom, drove the people mad.  The men of Kent even invited over, \nto take possession of Dover, their old enemy Count Eustace of \nBoulogne, who had led the fray when the Dover man was slain at his \nown fireside.  The men of Hereford, aided by the Welsh, and \ncommanded by a chief named EDRIC THE WILD, drove the Normans out of \ntheir country.  Some of those who had been dispossessed of their \nlands, banded together in the North of England; some, in Scotland; \nsome, in the thick woods and marshes; and whensoever they could \nfall upon the Normans, or upon the English who had submitted to the \nNormans, they fought, despoiled, and murdered, like the desperate \noutlaws that they were.  Conspiracies were set on foot for a \ngeneral massacre of the Normans, like the old massacre of the \nDanes.  In short, the English were in a murderous mood all through \nthe kingdom.\n\nKing William, fearing he might lose his conquest, came back, and \ntried to pacify the London people by soft words.  He then set forth \nto repress the country people by stern deeds.  Among the towns \nwhich he besieged, and where he killed and maimed the inhabitants \nwithout any distinction, sparing none, young or old, armed or \nunarmed, were Oxford, Warwick, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, \nLincoln, York.  In all these places, and in many others, fire and \nsword worked their utmost horrors, and made the land dreadful to \nbehold.  The streams and rivers were discoloured with blood; the \nsky was blackened with smoke; the fields were wastes of ashes; the \nwaysides were heaped up with dead.  Such are the fatal results of \nconquest and ambition!  Although William was a harsh and angry man, \nI do not suppose that he deliberately meant to work this shocking \nruin, when he invaded England.  But what he had got by the strong \nhand, he could only keep by the strong hand, and in so doing he \nmade England a great grave.\n\nTwo sons of Harold, by name EDMUND and GODWIN, came over from \nIreland, with some ships, against the Normans, but were defeated.  \nThis was scarcely done, when the outlaws in the woods so harassed \nYork, that the Governor sent to the King for help.  The King \ndespatched a general and a large force to occupy the town of \nDurham.  The Bishop of that place met the general outside the town, \nand warned him not to enter, as he would be in danger there.  The \ngeneral cared nothing for the warning, and went in with all his \nmen.  That night, on every hill within sight of Durham, signal \nfires were seen to blaze.  When the morning dawned, the English, \nwho had assembled in great strength, forced the gates, rushed into \nthe town, and slew the Normans every one.  The English afterwards \nbesought the Danes to come and help them.  The Danes came, with two \nhundred and forty ships.  The outlawed nobles joined them; they \ncaptured York, and drove the Normans out of that city.  Then, \nWilliam bribed the Danes to go away; and took such vengeance on the \nEnglish, that all the former fire and sword, smoke and ashes, death \nand ruin, were nothing compared with it.  In melancholy songs, and \ndoleful stories, it was still sung and told by cottage fires on \nwinter evenings, a hundred years afterwards, how, in those dreadful \ndays of the Normans, there was not, from the River Humber to the \nRiver Tyne, one inhabited village left, nor one cultivated field - \nhow there was nothing but a dismal ruin, where the human creatures \nand the beasts lay dead together.\n\nThe outlaws had, at this time, what they called a Camp of Refuge, \nin the midst of the fens of Cambridgeshire.  Protected by those \nmarshy grounds which were difficult of approach, they lay among the \nreeds and rushes, and were hidden by the mists that rose up from \nthe watery earth.  Now, there also was, at that time, over the sea \nin Flanders, an Englishman named HEREWARD, whose father had died in \nhis absence, and whose property had been given to a Norman.  When \nhe heard of this wrong that had been done him (from such of the \nexiled English as chanced to wander into that country), he longed \nfor revenge; and joining the outlaws in their camp of refuge, \nbecame their commander.  He was so good a soldier, that the Normans \nsupposed him to be aided by enchantment.  William, even after he \nhad made a road three miles in length across the Cambridgeshire \nmarshes, on purpose to attack this supposed enchanter, thought it \nnecessary to engage an old lady, who pretended to be a sorceress, \nto come and do a little enchantment in the royal cause.  For this \npurpose she was pushed on before the troops in a wooden tower; but \nHereward very soon disposed of this unfortunate sorceress, by \nburning her, tower and all.  The monks of the convent of Ely near \nat hand, however, who were fond of good living, and who found it \nvery uncomfortable to have the country blockaded and their supplies \nof meat and drink cut off, showed the King a secret way of \nsurprising the camp.  So Hereward was soon defeated.  Whether he \nafterwards died quietly, or whether he was killed after killing \nsixteen of the men who attacked him (as some old rhymes relate that \nhe did), I cannot say.  His defeat put an end to the Camp of \nRefuge; and, very soon afterwards, the King, victorious both in \nScotland and in England, quelled the last rebellious English noble.  \nHe then surrounded himself with Norman lords, enriched by the \nproperty of English nobles; had a great survey made of all the land \nin England, which was entered as the property of its new owners, on \na roll called Doomsday Book; obliged the people to put out their \nfires and candles at a certain hour every night, on the ringing of \na bell which was called The Curfew; introduced the Norman dresses \nand manners; made the Normans masters everywhere, and the English, \nservants; turned out the English bishops, and put Normans in their \nplaces; and showed himself to be the Conqueror indeed.\n\nBut, even with his own Normans, he had a restless life.  They were \nalways hungering and thirsting for the riches of the English; and \nthe more he gave, the more they wanted.  His priests were as greedy \nas his soldiers.  We know of only one Norman who plainly told his \nmaster, the King, that he had come with him to England to do his \nduty as a faithful servant, and that property taken by force from \nother men had no charms for him.  His name was GUILBERT.  We should \nnot forget his name, for it is good to remember and to honour \nhonest men.\n\nBesides all these troubles, William the Conqueror was troubled by \nquarrels among his sons.  He had three living.  ROBERT, called \nCURTHOSE, because of his short legs; WILLIAM, called RUFUS or the \nRed, from the colour of his hair; and HENRY, fond of learning, and \ncalled, in the Norman language, BEAUCLERC, or Fine-Scholar.  When \nRobert grew up, he asked of his father the government of Normandy, \nwhich he had nominally possessed, as a child, under his mother, \nMATILDA.  The King refusing to grant it, Robert became jealous and \ndiscontented; and happening one day, while in this temper, to be \nridiculed by his brothers, who threw water on him from a balcony as \nhe was walking before the door, he drew his sword, rushed up-\nstairs, and was only prevented by the King himself from putting \nthem to death.  That same night, he hotly departed with some \nfollowers from his father\'s court, and endeavoured to take the \nCastle of Rouen by surprise.  Failing in this, he shut himself up \nin another Castle in Normandy, which the King besieged, and where \nRobert one day unhorsed and nearly killed him without knowing who \nhe was.  His submission when he discovered his father, and the \nintercession of the queen and others, reconciled them; but not \nsoundly; for Robert soon strayed abroad, and went from court to \ncourt with his complaints.  He was a gay, careless, thoughtless \nfellow, spending all he got on musicians and dancers; but his \nmother loved him, and often, against the King\'s command, supplied \nhim with money through a messenger named SAMSON.  At length the \nincensed King swore he would tear out Samson\'s eyes; and Samson, \nthinking that his only hope of safety was in becoming a monk, \nbecame one, went on such errands no more, and kept his eyes in his \nhead.\n\nAll this time, from the turbulent day of his strange coronation, \nthe Conqueror had been struggling, you see, at any cost of cruelty \nand bloodshed, to maintain what he had seized.  All his reign, he \nstruggled still, with the same object ever before him.  He was a \nstern, bold man, and he succeeded in it.\n\nHe loved money, and was particular in his eating, but he had only \nleisure to indulge one other passion, and that was his love of \nhunting.  He carried it to such a height that he ordered whole \nvillages and towns to be swept away to make forests for the deer.  \nNot satisfied with sixty-eight Royal Forests, he laid waste an \nimmense district, to form another in Hampshire, called the New \nForest.  The many thousands of miserable peasants who saw their \nlittle houses pulled down, and themselves and children turned into \nthe open country without a shelter, detested him for his merciless \naddition to their many sufferings; and when, in the twenty-first \nyear of his reign (which proved to be the last), he went over to \nRouen, England was as full of hatred against him, as if every leaf \non every tree in all his Royal Forests had been a curse upon his \nhead.  In the New Forest, his son Richard (for he had four sons) \nhad been gored to death by a Stag; and the people said that this so \ncruelly-made Forest would yet be fatal to others of the Conqueror\'s \nrace.\n\nHe was engaged in a dispute with the King of France about some \nterritory.  While he stayed at Rouen, negotiating with that King, \nhe kept his bed and took medicines:  being advised by his \nphysicians to do so, on account of having grown to an unwieldy \nsize.  Word being brought to him that the King of France made light \nof this, and joked about it, he swore in a great rage that he \nshould rue his jests.  He assembled his army, marched into the \ndisputed territory, burnt - his old way! - the vines, the crops, \nand fruit, and set the town of Mantes on fire.  But, in an evil \nhour; for, as he rode over the hot ruins, his horse, setting his \nhoofs upon some burning embers, started, threw him forward against \nthe pommel of the saddle, and gave him a mortal hurt.  For six \nweeks he lay dying in a monastery near Rouen, and then made his \nwill, giving England to William, Normandy to Robert, and five \nthousand pounds to Henry.  And now, his violent deeds lay heavy on \nhis mind.  He ordered money to be given to many English churches \nand monasteries, and - which was much better repentance - released \nhis prisoners of state, some of whom had been confined in his \ndungeons twenty years.\n\nIt was a September morning, and the sun was rising, when the King \nwas awakened from slumber by the sound of a church bell.  \'What \nbell is that?\' he faintly asked.  They told him it was the bell of \nthe chapel of Saint Mary.  \'I commend my soul,\' said he, \'to Mary!\' \nand died.\n\nThink of his name, The Conqueror, and then consider how he lay in \ndeath!  The moment he was dead, his physicians, priests, and \nnobles, not knowing what contest for the throne might now take \nplace, or what might happen in it, hastened away, each man for \nhimself and his own property; the mercenary servants of the court \nbegan to rob and plunder; the body of the King, in the indecent \nstrife, was rolled from the bed, and lay alone, for hours, upon the \nground.  O Conqueror, of whom so many great names are proud now, of \nwhom so many great names thought nothing then, it were better to \nhave conquered one true heart, than England!\n\nBy-and-by, the priests came creeping in with prayers and candles; \nand a good knight, named HERLUIN, undertook (which no one else \nwould do) to convey the body to Caen, in Normandy, in order that it \nmight be buried in St. Stephen\'s church there, which the Conqueror \nhad founded.  But fire, of which he had made such bad use in his \nlife, seemed to follow him of itself in death.  A great \nconflagration broke out in the town when the body was placed in the \nchurch; and those present running out to extinguish the flames, it \nwas once again left alone.\n\nIt was not even buried in peace.  It was about to be let down, in \nits Royal robes, into a tomb near the high altar, in presence of a \ngreat concourse of people, when a loud voice in the crowd cried \nout, \'This ground is mine!  Upon it, stood my father\'s house.  This \nKing despoiled me of both ground and house to build this church.  \nIn the great name of GOD, I here forbid his body to be covered with \nthe earth that is my right!\'  The priests and bishops present, \nknowing the speaker\'s right, and knowing that the King had often \ndenied him justice, paid him down sixty shillings for the grave.  \nEven then, the corpse was not at rest.  The tomb was too small, and \nthey tried to force it in.  It broke, a dreadful smell arose, the \npeople hurried out into the air, and, for the third time, it was \nleft alone.\n\nWhere were the Conqueror\'s three sons, that they were not at their \nfather\'s burial?  Robert was lounging among minstrels, dancers, and \ngamesters, in France or Germany.  Henry was carrying his five \nthousand pounds safely away in a convenient chest he had got made.  \nWilliam the Red was hurrying to England, to lay hands upon the \nRoyal treasure and the crown.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX - ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE SECOND, CALLED RUFUS\n\n\n\nWILLIAM THE RED, in breathless haste, secured the three great forts \nof Dover, Pevensey, and Hastings, and made with hot speed for \nWinchester, where the Royal treasure was kept.  The treasurer \ndelivering him the keys, he found that it amounted to sixty \nthousand pounds in silver, besides gold and jewels.  Possessed of \nthis wealth, he soon persuaded the Archbishop of Canterbury to \ncrown him, and became William the Second, King of England.\n\nRufus was no sooner on the throne, than he ordered into prison \nagain the unhappy state captives whom his father had set free, and \ndirected a goldsmith to ornament his father\'s tomb profusely with \ngold and silver.  It would have been more dutiful in him to have \nattended the sick Conqueror when he was dying; but England itself, \nlike this Red King, who once governed it, has sometimes made \nexpensive tombs for dead men whom it treated shabbily when they \nwere alive.\n\nThe King\'s brother, Robert of Normandy, seeming quite content to be \nonly Duke of that country; and the King\'s other brother, Fine-\nScholar, being quiet enough with his five thousand pounds in a \nchest; the King flattered himself, we may suppose, with the hope of \nan easy reign.  But easy reigns were difficult to have in those \ndays.  The turbulent Bishop ODO (who had blessed the Norman army at \nthe Battle of Hastings, and who, I dare say, took all the credit of \nthe victory to himself) soon began, in concert with some powerful \nNorman nobles, to trouble the Red King.\n\nThe truth seems to be that this bishop and his friends, who had \nlands in England and lands in Normandy, wished to hold both under \none Sovereign; and greatly preferred a thoughtless good-natured \nperson, such as Robert was, to Rufus; who, though far from being an \namiable man in any respect, was keen, and not to be imposed upon.  \nThey declared in Robert\'s favour, and retired to their castles \n(those castles were very troublesome to kings) in a sullen humour.  \nThe Red King, seeing the Normans thus falling from him, revenged \nhimself upon them by appealing to the English; to whom he made a \nvariety of promises, which he never meant to perform - in \nparticular, promises to soften the cruelty of the Forest Laws; and \nwho, in return, so aided him with their valour, that ODO was \nbesieged in the Castle of Rochester, and forced to abandon it, and \nto depart from England for ever:  whereupon the other rebellious \nNorman nobles were soon reduced and scattered.\n\nThen, the Red King went over to Normandy, where the people suffered \ngreatly under the loose rule of Duke Robert.  The King\'s object was \nto seize upon the Duke\'s dominions.  This, the Duke, of course, \nprepared to resist; and miserable war between the two brothers \nseemed inevitable, when the powerful nobles on both sides, who had \nseen so much of war, interfered to prevent it.  A treaty was made.  \nEach of the two brothers agreed to give up something of his claims, \nand that the longer-liver of the two should inherit all the \ndominions of the other.  When they had come to this loving \nunderstanding, they embraced and joined their forces against Fine-\nScholar; who had bought some territory of Robert with a part of his \nfive thousand pounds, and was considered a dangerous individual in \nconsequence.\n\nSt. Michael\'s Mount, in Normandy (there is another St. Michael\'s \nMount, in Cornwall, wonderfully like it), was then, as it is now, a \nstrong place perched upon the top of a high rock, around which, \nwhen the tide is in, the sea flows, leaving no road to the \nmainland.  In this place, Fine-Scholar shut himself up with his \nsoldiers, and here he was closely besieged by his two brothers.  At \none time, when he was reduced to great distress for want of water, \nthe generous Robert not only permitted his men to get water, but \nsent Fine-Scholar wine from his own table; and, on being \nremonstrated with by the Red King, said \'What! shall we let our own \nbrother die of thirst?  Where shall we get another, when he is \ngone?\'  At another time, the Red King riding alone on the shore of \nthe bay, looking up at the Castle, was taken by two of Fine-\nScholar\'s men, one of whom was about to kill him, when he cried \nout, \'Hold, knave!  I am the King of England!\'  The story says that \nthe soldier raised him from the ground respectfully and humbly, and \nthat the King took him into his service.  The story may or may not \nbe true; but at any rate it is true that Fine-Scholar could not \nhold out against his united brothers, and that he abandoned Mount \nSt. Michael, and wandered about - as poor and forlorn as other \nscholars have been sometimes known to be.\n\nThe Scotch became unquiet in the Red King\'s time, and were twice \ndefeated - the second time, with the loss of their King, Malcolm, \nand his son.  The Welsh became unquiet too.  Against them, Rufus \nwas less successful; for they fought among their native mountains, \nand did great execution on the King\'s troops.  Robert of Normandy \nbecame unquiet too; and, complaining that his brother the King did \nnot faithfully perform his part of their agreement, took up arms, \nand obtained assistance from the King of France, whom Rufus, in the \nend, bought off with vast sums of money.  England became unquiet \ntoo.  Lord Mowbray, the powerful Earl of Northumberland, headed a \ngreat conspiracy to depose the King, and to place upon the throne, \nSTEPHEN, the Conqueror\'s near relative.  The plot was discovered; \nall the chief conspirators were seized; some were fined, some were \nput in prison, some were put to death.  The Earl of Northumberland \nhimself was shut up in a dungeon beneath Windsor Castle, where he \ndied, an old man, thirty long years afterwards.  The Priests in \nEngland were more unquiet than any other class or power; for the \nRed King treated them with such small ceremony that he refused to \nappoint new bishops or archbishops when the old ones died, but kept \nall the wealth belonging to those offices in his own hands.  In \nreturn for this, the Priests wrote his life when he was dead, and \nabused him well.  I am inclined to think, myself, that there was \nlittle to choose between the Priests and the Red King; that both \nsides were greedy and designing; and that they were fairly matched.\n\nThe Red King was false of heart, selfish, covetous, and mean.  He \nhad a worthy minister in his favourite, Ralph, nicknamed - for \nalmost every famous person had a nickname in those rough days - \nFlambard, or the Firebrand.  Once, the King being ill, became \npenitent, and made ANSELM, a foreign priest and a good man, \nArchbishop of Canterbury.  But he no sooner got well again than he \nrepented of his repentance, and persisted in wrongfully keeping to \nhimself some of the wealth belonging to the archbishopric.  This \nled to violent disputes, which were aggravated by there being in \nRome at that time two rival Popes; each of whom declared he was the \nonly real original infallible Pope, who couldn\'t make a mistake.  \nAt last, Anselm, knowing the Red King\'s character, and not feeling \nhimself safe in England, asked leave to return abroad.  The Red \nKing gladly gave it; for he knew that as soon as Anselm was gone, \nhe could begin to store up all the Canterbury money again, for his \nown use.\n\nBy such means, and by taxing and oppressing the English people in \nevery possible way, the Red King became very rich.  When he wanted \nmoney for any purpose, he raised it by some means or other, and \ncared nothing for the injustice he did, or the misery he caused.  \nHaving the opportunity of buying from Robert the whole duchy of \nNormandy for five years, he taxed the English people more than \never, and made the very convents sell their plate and valuables to \nsupply him with the means to make the purchase.  But he was as \nquick and eager in putting down revolt as he was in raising money; \nfor, a part of the Norman people objecting - very naturally, I \nthink - to being sold in this way, he headed an army against them \nwith all the speed and energy of his father.  He was so impatient, \nthat he embarked for Normandy in a great gale of wind.  And when \nthe sailors told him it was dangerous to go to sea in such angry \nweather, he replied, \'Hoist sail and away!  Did you ever hear of a \nking who was drowned?\'\n\nYou will wonder how it was that even the careless Robert came to \nsell his dominions.  It happened thus.  It had long been the custom \nfor many English people to make journeys to Jerusalem, which were \ncalled pilgrimages, in order that they might pray beside the tomb \nof Our Saviour there.  Jerusalem belonging to the Turks, and the \nTurks hating Christianity, these Christian travellers were often \ninsulted and ill used.  The Pilgrims bore it patiently for some \ntime, but at length a remarkable man, of great earnestness and \neloquence, called PETER THE HERMIT, began to preach in various \nplaces against the Turks, and to declare that it was the duty of \ngood Christians to drive away those unbelievers from the tomb of \nOur Saviour, and to take possession of it, and protect it.  An \nexcitement such as the world had never known before was created.  \nThousands and thousands of men of all ranks and conditions departed \nfor Jerusalem to make war against the Turks.  The war is called in \nhistory the first Crusade, and every Crusader wore a cross marked \non his right shoulder.\n\nAll the Crusaders were not zealous Christians.  Among them were \nvast numbers of the restless, idle, profligate, and adventurous \nspirit of the time.  Some became Crusaders for the love of change; \nsome, in the hope of plunder; some, because they had nothing to do \nat home; some, because they did what the priests told them; some, \nbecause they liked to see foreign countries; some, because they \nwere fond of knocking men about, and would as soon knock a Turk \nabout as a Christian.  Robert of Normandy may have been influenced \nby all these motives; and by a kind desire, besides, to save the \nChristian Pilgrims from bad treatment in future.  He wanted to \nraise a number of armed men, and to go to the Crusade.  He could \nnot do so without money.  He had no money; and he sold his \ndominions to his brother, the Red King, for five years.  With the \nlarge sum he thus obtained, he fitted out his Crusaders gallantly, \nand went away to Jerusalem in martial state.  The Red King, who \nmade money out of everything, stayed at home, busily squeezing more \nmoney out of Normans and English.\n\nAfter three years of great hardship and suffering - from shipwreck \nat sea; from travel in strange lands; from hunger, thirst, and \nfever, upon the burning sands of the desert; and from the fury of \nthe Turks - the valiant Crusaders got possession of Our Saviour\'s \ntomb.  The Turks were still resisting and fighting bravely, but \nthis success increased the general desire in Europe to join the \nCrusade.  Another great French Duke was proposing to sell his \ndominions for a term to the rich Red King, when the Red King\'s \nreign came to a sudden and violent end.\n\nYou have not forgotten the New Forest which the Conqueror made, and \nwhich the miserable people whose homes he had laid waste, so hated.  \nThe cruelty of the Forest Laws, and the torture and death they \nbrought upon the peasantry, increased this hatred.  The poor \npersecuted country people believed that the New Forest was \nenchanted.  They said that in thunder-storms, and on dark nights, \ndemons appeared, moving beneath the branches of the gloomy trees.  \nThey said that a terrible spectre had foretold to Norman hunters \nthat the Red King should be punished there.  And now, in the \npleasant season of May, when the Red King had reigned almost \nthirteen years; and a second Prince of the Conqueror\'s blood - \nanother Richard, the son of Duke Robert - was killed by an arrow in \nthis dreaded Forest; the people said that the second time was not \nthe last, and that there was another death to come.\n\nIt was a lonely forest, accursed in the people\'s hearts for the \nwicked deeds that had been done to make it; and no man save the \nKing and his Courtiers and Huntsmen, liked to stray there.  But, in \nreality, it was like any other forest.  In the spring, the green \nleaves broke out of the buds; in the summer, flourished heartily, \nand made deep shades; in the winter, shrivelled and blew down, and \nlay in brown heaps on the moss.  Some trees were stately, and grew \nhigh and strong; some had fallen of themselves; some were felled by \nthe forester\'s axe; some were hollow, and the rabbits burrowed at \ntheir roots; some few were struck by lightning, and stood white and \nbare.  There were hill-sides covered with rich fern, on which the \nmorning dew so beautifully sparkled; there were brooks, where the \ndeer went down to drink, or over which the whole herd bounded, \nflying from the arrows of the huntsmen; there were sunny glades, \nand solemn places where but little light came through the rustling \nleaves.  The songs of the birds in the New Forest were pleasanter \nto hear than the shouts of fighting men outside; and even when the \nRed King and his Court came hunting through its solitudes, cursing \nloud and riding hard, with a jingling of stirrups and bridles and \nknives and daggers, they did much less harm there than among the \nEnglish or Normans, and the stags died (as they lived) far easier \nthan the people.\n\nUpon a day in August, the Red King, now reconciled to his brother, \nFine-Scholar, came with a great train to hunt in the New Forest.  \nFine-Scholar was of the party.  They were a merry party, and had \nlain all night at Malwood-Keep, a hunting-lodge in the forest, \nwhere they had made good cheer, both at supper and breakfast, and \nhad drunk a deal of wine.  The party dispersed in various \ndirections, as the custom of hunters then was.  The King took with \nhim only SIR WALTER TYRREL, who was a famous sportsman, and to whom \nhe had given, before they mounted horse that morning, two fine \narrows.\n\nThe last time the King was ever seen alive, he was riding with Sir \nWalter Tyrrel, and their dogs were hunting together.\n\nIt was almost night, when a poor charcoal-burner, passing through \nthe forest with his cart, came upon the solitary body of a dead \nman, shot with an arrow in the breast, and still bleeding.  He got \nit into his cart.  It was the body of the King.  Shaken and \ntumbled, with its red beard all whitened with lime and clotted with \nblood, it was driven in the cart by the charcoal-burner next day to \nWinchester Cathedral, where it was received and buried.\n\nSir Walter Tyrrel, who escaped to Normandy, and claimed the \nprotection of the King of France, swore in France that the Red King \nwas suddenly shot dead by an arrow from an unseen hand, while they \nwere hunting together; that he was fearful of being suspected as \nthe King\'s murderer; and that he instantly set spurs to his horse, \nand fled to the sea-shore.  Others declared that the King and Sir \nWalter Tyrrel were hunting in company, a little before sunset, \nstanding in bushes opposite one another, when a stag came between \nthem.  That the King drew his bow and took aim, but the string \nbroke.  That the King then cried, \'Shoot, Walter, in the Devil\'s \nname!\'  That Sir Walter shot.  That the arrow glanced against a \ntree, was turned aside from the stag, and struck the King from his \nhorse, dead.\n\nBy whose hand the Red King really fell, and whether that hand \ndespatched the arrow to his breast by accident or by design, is \nonly known to GOD.  Some think his brother may have caused him to \nbe killed; but the Red King had made so many enemies, both among \npriests and people, that suspicion may reasonably rest upon a less \nunnatural murderer.  Men know no more than that he was found dead \nin the New Forest, which the suffering people had regarded as a \ndoomed ground for his race.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIRST, CALLED FINE-SCHOLAR\n\n\n\nFINE-SCHOLAR, on hearing of the Red King\'s death, hurried to \nWinchester with as much speed as Rufus himself had made, to seize \nthe Royal treasure.  But the keeper of the treasure who had been \none of the hunting-party in the Forest, made haste to Winchester \ntoo, and, arriving there at about the same time, refused to yield \nit up.  Upon this, Fine-Scholar drew his sword, and threatened to \nkill the treasurer; who might have paid for his fidelity with his \nlife, but that he knew longer resistance to be useless when he \nfound the Prince supported by a company of powerful barons, who \ndeclared they were determined to make him King.  The treasurer, \ntherefore, gave up the money and jewels of the Crown:  and on the \nthird day after the death of the Red King, being a Sunday, Fine-\nScholar stood before the high altar in Westminster Abbey, and made \na solemn declaration that he would resign the Church property which \nhis brother had seized; that he would do no wrong to the nobles; \nand that he would restore to the people the laws of Edward the \nConfessor, with all the improvements of William the Conqueror.  So \nbegan the reign of KING HENRY THE FIRST.\n\nThe people were attached to their new King, both because he had \nknown distresses, and because he was an Englishman by birth and not \na Norman.  To strengthen this last hold upon them, the King wished \nto marry an English lady; and could think of no other wife than \nMAUD THE GOOD, the daughter of the King of Scotland.  Although this \ngood Princess did not love the King, she was so affected by the \nrepresentations the nobles made to her of the great charity it \nwould be in her to unite the Norman and Saxon races, and prevent \nhatred and bloodshed between them for the future, that she \nconsented to become his wife.  After some disputing among the \npriests, who said that as she had been in a convent in her youth, \nand had worn the veil of a nun, she could not lawfully be married - \nagainst which the Princess stated that her aunt, with whom she had \nlived in her youth, had indeed sometimes thrown a piece of black \nstuff over her, but for no other reason than because the nun\'s veil \nwas the only dress the conquering Normans respected in girl or \nwoman, and not because she had taken the vows of a nun, which she \nnever had - she was declared free to marry, and was made King \nHenry\'s Queen.  A good Queen she was; beautiful, kind-hearted, and \nworthy of a better husband than the King.\n\nFor he was a cunning and unscrupulous man, though firm and clever.  \nHe cared very little for his word, and took any means to gain his \nends.  All this is shown in his treatment of his brother Robert - \nRobert, who had suffered him to be refreshed with water, and who \nhad sent him the wine from his own table, when he was shut up, with \nthe crows flying below him, parched with thirst, in the castle on \nthe top of St. Michael\'s Mount, where his Red brother would have \nlet him die.\n\nBefore the King began to deal with Robert, he removed and disgraced \nall the favourites of the late King; who were for the most part \nbase characters, much detested by the people.  Flambard, or \nFirebrand, whom the late King had made Bishop of Durham, of all \nthings in the world, Henry imprisoned in the Tower; but Firebrand \nwas a great joker and a jolly companion, and made himself so \npopular with his guards that they pretended to know nothing about a \nlong rope that was sent into his prison at the bottom of a deep \nflagon of wine.  The guards took the wine, and Firebrand took the \nrope; with which, when they were fast asleep, he let himself down \nfrom a window in the night, and so got cleverly aboard ship and \naway to Normandy.\n\nNow Robert, when his brother Fine-Scholar came to the throne, was \nstill absent in the Holy Land.  Henry pretended that Robert had \nbeen made Sovereign of that country; and he had been away so long, \nthat the ignorant people believed it.  But, behold, when Henry had \nbeen some time King of England, Robert came home to Normandy; \nhaving leisurely returned from Jerusalem through Italy, in which \nbeautiful country he had enjoyed himself very much, and had married \na lady as beautiful as itself!  In Normandy, he found Firebrand \nwaiting to urge him to assert his claim to the English crown, and \ndeclare war against King Henry.  This, after great loss of time in \nfeasting and dancing with his beautiful Italian wife among his \nNorman friends, he at last did.\n\nThe English in general were on King Henry\'s side, though many of \nthe Normans were on Robert\'s.  But the English sailors deserted the \nKing, and took a great part of the English fleet over to Normandy; \nso that Robert came to invade this country in no foreign vessels, \nbut in English ships.  The virtuous Anselm, however, whom Henry had \ninvited back from abroad, and made Archbishop of Canterbury, was \nsteadfast in the King\'s cause; and it was so well supported that \nthe two armies, instead of fighting, made a peace.  Poor Robert, \nwho trusted anybody and everybody, readily trusted his brother, the \nKing; and agreed to go home and receive a pension from England, on \ncondition that all his followers were fully pardoned.  This the \nKing very faithfully promised, but Robert was no sooner gone than \nhe began to punish them.\n\nAmong them was the Earl of Shrewsbury, who, on being summoned by \nthe King to answer to five-and-forty accusations, rode away to one \nof his strong castles, shut himself up therein, called around him \nhis tenants and vassals, and fought for his liberty, but was \ndefeated and banished.  Robert, with all his faults, was so true to \nhis word, that when he first heard of this nobleman having risen \nagainst his brother, he laid waste the Earl of Shrewsbury\'s estates \nin Normandy, to show the King that he would favour no breach of \ntheir treaty.  Finding, on better information, afterwards, that the \nEarl\'s only crime was having been his friend, he came over to \nEngland, in his old thoughtless, warm-hearted way, to intercede \nwith the King, and remind him of the solemn promise to pardon all \nhis followers.\n\nThis confidence might have put the false King to the blush, but it \ndid not.  Pretending to be very friendly, he so surrounded his \nbrother with spies and traps, that Robert, who was quite in his \npower, had nothing for it but to renounce his pension and escape \nwhile he could.  Getting home to Normandy, and understanding the \nKing better now, he naturally allied himself with his old friend \nthe Earl of Shrewsbury, who had still thirty castles in that \ncountry.  This was exactly what Henry wanted.  He immediately \ndeclared that Robert had broken the treaty, and next year invaded \nNormandy.\n\nHe pretended that he came to deliver the Normans, at their own \nrequest, from his brother\'s misrule.  There is reason to fear that \nhis misrule was bad enough; for his beautiful wife had died, \nleaving him with an infant son, and his court was again so \ncareless, dissipated, and ill-regulated, that it was said he \nsometimes lay in bed of a day for want of clothes to put on - his \nattendants having stolen all his dresses.  But he headed his army \nlike a brave prince and a gallant soldier, though he had the \nmisfortune to be taken prisoner by King Henry, with four hundred of \nhis Knights.  Among them was poor harmless Edgar Atheling, who \nloved Robert well.  Edgar was not important enough to be severe \nwith.  The King afterwards gave him a small pension, which he lived \nupon and died upon, in peace, among the quiet woods and fields of \nEngland.\n\nAnd Robert - poor, kind, generous, wasteful, heedless Robert, with \nso many faults, and yet with virtues that might have made a better \nand a happier man - what was the end of him?  If the King had had \nthe magnanimity to say with a kind air, \'Brother, tell me, before \nthese noblemen, that from this time you will be my faithful \nfollower and friend, and never raise your hand against me or my \nforces more!\' he might have trusted Robert to the death.  But the \nKing was not a magnanimous man.  He sentenced his brother to be \nconfined for life in one of the Royal Castles.  In the beginning of \nhis imprisonment, he was allowed to ride out, guarded; but he one \nday broke away from his guard and galloped of.  He had the evil \nfortune to ride into a swamp, where his horse stuck fast and he was \ntaken.  When the King heard of it he ordered him to be blinded, \nwhich was done by putting a red-hot metal basin on his eyes.\n\nAnd so, in darkness and in prison, many years, he thought of all \nhis past life, of the time he had wasted, of the treasure he had \nsquandered, of the opportunities he had lost, of the youth he had \nthrown away, of the talents he had neglected.  Sometimes, on fine \nautumn mornings, he would sit and think of the old hunting parties \nin the free Forest, where he had been the foremost and the gayest.  \nSometimes, in the still nights, he would wake, and mourn for the \nmany nights that had stolen past him at the gaming-table; \nsometimes, would seem to hear, upon the melancholy wind, the old \nsongs of the minstrels; sometimes, would dream, in his blindness, \nof the light and glitter of the Norman Court.  Many and many a \ntime, he groped back, in his fancy, to Jerusalem, where he had \nfought so well; or, at the head of his brave companions, bowed his \nfeathered helmet to the shouts of welcome greeting him in Italy, \nand seemed again to walk among the sunny vineyards, or on the shore \nof the blue sea, with his lovely wife.  And then, thinking of her \ngrave, and of his fatherless boy, he would stretch out his solitary \narms and weep.\n\nAt length, one day, there lay in prison, dead, with cruel and \ndisfiguring scars upon his eyelids, bandaged from his jailer\'s \nsight, but on which the eternal Heavens looked down, a worn old man \nof eighty.  He had once been Robert of Normandy.  Pity him!\n\nAt the time when Robert of Normandy was taken prisoner by his \nbrother, Robert\'s little son was only five years old.  This child \nwas taken, too, and carried before the King, sobbing and crying; \nfor, young as he was, he knew he had good reason to be afraid of \nhis Royal uncle.  The King was not much accustomed to pity those \nwho were in his power, but his cold heart seemed for the moment to \nsoften towards the boy.  He was observed to make a great effort, as \nif to prevent himself from being cruel, and ordered the child to be \ntaken away; whereupon a certain Baron, who had married a daughter \nof Duke Robert\'s (by name, Helie of Saint Saen), took charge of \nhim, tenderly.  The King\'s gentleness did not last long.  Before \ntwo years were over, he sent messengers to this lord\'s Castle to \nseize the child and bring him away.  The Baron was not there at the \ntime, but his servants were faithful, and carried the boy off in \nhis sleep and hid him.  When the Baron came home, and was told what \nthe King had done, he took the child abroad, and, leading him by \nthe hand, went from King to King and from Court to Court, relating \nhow the child had a claim to the throne of England, and how his \nuncle the King, knowing that he had that claim, would have murdered \nhim, perhaps, but for his escape.\n\nThe youth and innocence of the pretty little WILLIAM FITZ-ROBERT \n(for that was his name) made him many friends at that time.  When \nhe became a young man, the King of France, uniting with the French \nCounts of Anjou and Flanders, supported his cause against the King \nof England, and took many of the King\'s towns and castles in \nNormandy.  But, King Henry, artful and cunning always, bribed some \nof William\'s friends with money, some with promises, some with \npower.  He bought off the Count of Anjou, by promising to marry his \neldest son, also named WILLIAM, to the Count\'s daughter; and indeed \nthe whole trust of this King\'s life was in such bargains, and he \nbelieved (as many another King has done since, and as one King did \nin France a very little time ago) that every man\'s truth and honour \ncan be bought at some price.  For all this, he was so afraid of \nWilliam Fitz-Robert and his friends, that, for a long time, he \nbelieved his life to be in danger; and never lay down to sleep, \neven in his palace surrounded by his guards, without having a sword \nand buckler at his bedside.\n\nTo strengthen his power, the King with great ceremony betrothed his \neldest daughter MATILDA, then a child only eight years old, to be \nthe wife of Henry the Fifth, the Emperor of Germany.  To raise her \nmarriage-portion, he taxed the English people in a most oppressive \nmanner; then treated them to a great procession, to restore their \ngood humour; and sent Matilda away, in fine state, with the German \nambassadors, to be educated in the country of her future husband.\n\nAnd now his Queen, Maud the Good, unhappily died.  It was a sad \nthought for that gentle lady, that the only hope with which she had \nmarried a man whom she had never loved - the hope of reconciling \nthe Norman and English races - had failed.  At the very time of her \ndeath, Normandy and all France was in arms against England; for, so \nsoon as his last danger was over, King Henry had been false to all \nthe French powers he had promised, bribed, and bought, and they had \nnaturally united against him.  After some fighting, however, in \nwhich few suffered but the unhappy common people (who always \nsuffered, whatsoever was the matter), he began to promise, bribe, \nand buy again; and by those means, and by the help of the Pope, who \nexerted himself to save more bloodshed, and by solemnly declaring, \nover and over again, that he really was in earnest this time, and \nwould keep his word, the King made peace.\n\nOne of the first consequences of this peace was, that the King went \nover to Normandy with his son Prince William and a great retinue, \nto have the Prince acknowledged as his successor by the Norman \nNobles, and to contract the promised marriage (this was one of the \nmany promises the King had broken) between him and the daughter of \nthe Count of Anjou.  Both these things were triumphantly done, with \ngreat show and rejoicing; and on the twenty-fifth of November, in \nthe year one thousand one hundred and twenty, the whole retinue \nprepared to embark at the Port of Barfleur, for the voyage home.\n\nOn that day, and at that place, there came to the King, Fitz-\nStephen, a sea-captain, and said:\n\n\'My liege, my father served your father all his life, upon the sea.  \nHe steered the ship with the golden boy upon the prow, in which \nyour father sailed to conquer England.  I beseech you to grant me \nthe same office.  I have a fair vessel in the harbour here, called \nThe White Ship, manned by fifty sailors of renown.  I pray you, \nSire, to let your servant have the honour of steering you in The \nWhite Ship to England!\'\n\n\'I am sorry, friend,\' replied the King, \'that my vessel is already \nchosen, and that I cannot (therefore) sail with the son of the man \nwho served my father.  But the Prince and all his company shall go \nalong with you, in the fair White Ship, manned by the fifty sailors \nof renown.\'\n\nAn hour or two afterwards, the King set sail in the vessel he had \nchosen, accompanied by other vessels, and, sailing all night with a \nfair and gentle wind, arrived upon the coast of England in the \nmorning.  While it was yet night, the people in some of those ships \nheard a faint wild cry come over the sea, and wondered what it was.\n\nNow, the Prince was a dissolute, debauched young man of eighteen, \nwho bore no love to the English, and had declared that when he came \nto the throne he would yoke them to the plough like oxen.  He went \naboard The White Ship, with one hundred and forty youthful Nobles \nlike himself, among whom were eighteen noble ladies of the highest \nrank.  All this gay company, with their servants and the fifty \nsailors, made three hundred souls aboard the fair White Ship.\n\n\'Give three casks of wine, Fitz-Stephen,\' said the Prince, \'to the \nfifty sailors of renown!  My father the King has sailed out of the \nharbour.  What time is there to make merry here, and yet reach \nEngland with the rest?\'\n\n\'Prince!\' said Fitz-Stephen, \'before morning, my fifty and The \nWhite Ship shall overtake the swiftest vessel in attendance on your \nfather the King, if we sail at midnight!\'\n\nThen the Prince commanded to make merry; and the sailors drank out \nthe three casks of wine; and the Prince and all the noble company \ndanced in the moonlight on the deck of The White Ship.\n\nWhen, at last, she shot out of the harbour of Barfleur, there was \nnot a sober seaman on board.  But the sails were all set, and the \noars all going merrily.  Fitz-Stephen had the helm.  The gay young \nnobles and the beautiful ladies, wrapped in mantles of various \nbright colours to protect them from the cold, talked, laughed, and \nsang.  The Prince encouraged the fifty sailors to row harder yet, \nfor the honour of The White Ship.\n\nCrash!  A terrific cry broke from three hundred hearts.  It was the \ncry the people in the distant vessels of the King heard faintly on \nthe water.  The White Ship had struck upon a rock - was filling - \ngoing down!\n\nFitz-Stephen hurried the Prince into a boat, with some few Nobles.  \n\'Push off,\' he whispered; \'and row to land.  It is not far, and the \nsea is smooth.  The rest of us must die.\'\n\nBut, as they rowed away, fast, from the sinking ship, the Prince \nheard the voice of his sister MARIE, the Countess of Perche, \ncalling for help.  He never in his life had been so good as he was \nthen.  He cried in an agony, \'Row back at any risk!  I cannot bear \nto leave her!\'\n\nThey rowed back.  As the Prince held out his arms to catch his \nsister, such numbers leaped in, that the boat was overset.  And in \nthe same instant The White Ship went down.\n\nOnly two men floated.  They both clung to the main yard of the \nship, which had broken from the mast, and now supported them.  One \nasked the other who he was?  He said, \'I am a nobleman, GODFREY by \nname, the son of GILBERT DE L\'AIGLE.  And you?\' said he.  \'I am \nBEROLD, a poor butcher of Rouen,\' was the answer.  Then, they said \ntogether, \'Lord be merciful to us both!\' and tried to encourage one \nanother, as they drifted in the cold benumbing sea on that \nunfortunate November night.\n\nBy-and-by, another man came swimming towards them, whom they knew, \nwhen he pushed aside his long wet hair, to be Fitz-Stephen.  \'Where \nis the Prince?\' said he.  \'Gone! Gone!\' the two cried together.  \n\'Neither he, nor his brother, nor his sister, nor the King\'s niece, \nnor her brother, nor any one of all the brave three hundred, noble \nor commoner, except we three, has risen above the water!\'  Fitz-\nStephen, with a ghastly face, cried, \'Woe! woe, to me!\' and sunk to \nthe bottom.\n\nThe other two clung to the yard for some hours.  At length the \nyoung noble said faintly, \'I am exhausted, and chilled with the \ncold, and can hold no longer.  Farewell, good friend!  God preserve \nyou!\'  So, he dropped and sunk; and of all the brilliant crowd, the \npoor Butcher of Rouen alone was saved.  In the morning, some \nfishermen saw him floating in his sheep-skin coat, and got him into \ntheir boat - the sole relater of the dismal tale.\n\nFor three days, no one dared to carry the intelligence to the King.  \nAt length, they sent into his presence a little boy, who, weeping \nbitterly, and kneeling at his feet, told him that The White Ship \nwas lost with all on board.  The King fell to the ground like a \ndead man, and never, never afterwards, was seen to smile.\n\nBut he plotted again, and promised again, and bribed and bought \nagain, in his old deceitful way.  Having no son to succeed him, \nafter all his pains (\'The Prince will never yoke us to the plough, \nnow!\' said the English people), he took a second wife - ADELAIS or \nALICE, a duke\'s daughter, and the Pope\'s niece.  Having no more \nchildren, however, he proposed to the Barons to swear that they \nwould recognise as his successor, his daughter Matilda, whom, as \nshe was now a widow, he married to the eldest son of the Count of \nAnjou, GEOFFREY, surnamed PLANTAGENET, from a custom he had of \nwearing a sprig of flowering broom (called Genàt in French) in his \ncap for a feather.  As one false man usually makes many, and as a \nfalse King, in particular, is pretty certain to make a false Court, \nthe Barons took the oath about the succession of Matilda (and her \nchildren after her), twice over, without in the least intending to \nkeep it.  The King was now relieved from any remaining fears of \nWilliam Fitz-Robert, by his death in the Monastery of St. Omer, in \nFrance, at twenty-six years old, of a pike-wound in the hand.  And \nas Matilda gave birth to three sons, he thought the succession to \nthe throne secure.\n\nHe spent most of the latter part of his life, which was troubled by \nfamily quarrels, in Normandy, to be near Matilda.  When he had \nreigned upward of thirty-five years, and was sixty-seven years old, \nhe died of an indigestion and fever, brought on by eating, when he \nwas far from well, of a fish called Lamprey, against which he had \noften been cautioned by his physicians.  His remains were brought \nover to Reading Abbey to be buried.\n\nYou may perhaps hear the cunning and promise-breaking of King Henry \nthe First, called \'policy\' by some people, and \'diplomacy\' by \nothers.  Neither of these fine words will in the least mean that it \nwas true; and nothing that is not true can possibly be good.\n\nHis greatest merit, that I know of, was his love of learning - I \nshould have given him greater credit even for that, if it had been \nstrong enough to induce him to spare the eyes of a certain poet he \nonce took prisoner, who was a knight besides.  But he ordered the \npoet\'s eyes to be torn from his head, because he had laughed at him \nin his verses; and the poet, in the pain of that torture, dashed \nout his own brains against his prison wall.  King Henry the First \nwas avaricious, revengeful, and so false, that I suppose a man \nnever lived whose word was less to be relied upon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI - ENGLAND UNDER MATILDA AND STEPHEN\n\n\n\nTHE King was no sooner dead than all the plans and schemes he had \nlaboured at so long, and lied so much for, crumbled away like a \nhollow heap of sand.  STEPHEN, whom he had never mistrusted or \nsuspected, started up to claim the throne.\n\nStephen was the son of ADELA, the Conqueror\'s daughter, married to \nthe Count of Blois.  To Stephen, and to his brother HENRY, the late \nKing had been liberal; making Henry Bishop of Winchester, and \nfinding a good marriage for Stephen, and much enriching him.  This \ndid not prevent Stephen from hastily producing a false witness, a \nservant of the late King, to swear that the King had named him for \nhis heir upon his death-bed.  On this evidence the Archbishop of \nCanterbury crowned him.  The new King, so suddenly made, lost not a \nmoment in seizing the Royal treasure, and hiring foreign soldiers \nwith some of it to protect his throne.\n\nIf the dead King had even done as the false witness said, he would \nhave had small right to will away the English people, like so many \nsheep or oxen, without their consent.  But he had, in fact, \nbequeathed all his territory to Matilda; who, supported by ROBERT, \nEarl of Gloucester, soon began to dispute the crown.  Some of the \npowerful barons and priests took her side; some took Stephen\'s; all \nfortified their castles; and again the miserable English people \nwere involved in war, from which they could never derive advantage \nwhosoever was victorious, and in which all parties plundered, \ntortured, starved, and ruined them.\n\nFive years had passed since the death of Henry the First - and \nduring those five years there had been two terrible invasions by \nthe people of Scotland under their King, David, who was at last \ndefeated with all his army - when Matilda, attended by her brother \nRobert and a large force, appeared in England to maintain her \nclaim.  A battle was fought between her troops and King Stephen\'s \nat Lincoln; in which the King himself was taken prisoner, after \nbravely fighting until his battle-axe and sword were broken, and \nwas carried into strict confinement at Gloucester.  Matilda then \nsubmitted herself to the Priests, and the Priests crowned her Queen \nof England.\n\nShe did not long enjoy this dignity.  The people of London had a \ngreat affection for Stephen; many of the Barons considered it \ndegrading to be ruled by a woman; and the Queen\'s temper was so \nhaughty that she made innumerable enemies.  The people of London \nrevolted; and, in alliance with the troops of Stephen, besieged her \nat Winchester, where they took her brother Robert prisoner, whom, \nas her best soldier and chief general, she was glad to exchange for \nStephen himself, who thus regained his liberty.  Then, the long war \nwent on afresh.  Once, she was pressed so hard in the Castle of \nOxford, in the winter weather when the snow lay thick upon the \nground, that her only chance of escape was to dress herself all in \nwhite, and, accompanied by no more than three faithful Knights, \ndressed in like manner that their figures might not be seen from \nStephen\'s camp as they passed over the snow, to steal away on foot, \ncross the frozen Thames, walk a long distance, and at last gallop \naway on horseback.  All this she did, but to no great purpose then; \nfor her brother dying while the struggle was yet going on, she at \nlast withdrew to Normandy.\n\nIn two or three years after her withdrawal her cause appeared in \nEngland, afresh, in the person of her son Henry, young Plantagenet, \nwho, at only eighteen years of age, was very powerful:  not only on \naccount of his mother having resigned all Normandy to him, but also \nfrom his having married ELEANOR, the divorced wife of the French \nKing, a bad woman, who had great possessions in France.  Louis, the \nFrench King, not relishing this arrangement, helped EUSTACE, King \nStephen\'s son, to invade Normandy:  but Henry drove their united \nforces out of that country, and then returned here, to assist his \npartisans, whom the King was then besieging at Wallingford upon the \nThames.  Here, for two days, divided only by the river, the two \narmies lay encamped opposite to one another - on the eve, as it \nseemed to all men, of another desperate fight, when the EARL OF \nARUNDEL took heart and said \'that it was not reasonable to prolong \nthe unspeakable miseries of two kingdoms to minister to the \nambition of two princes.\'\n\nMany other noblemen repeating and supporting this when it was once \nuttered, Stephen and young Plantagenet went down, each to his own \nbank of the river, and held a conversation across it, in which they \narranged a truce; very much to the dissatisfaction of Eustace, who \nswaggered away with some followers, and laid violent hands on the \nAbbey of St. Edmund\'s-Bury, where he presently died mad.  The truce \nled to a solemn council at Winchester, in which it was agreed that \nStephen should retain the crown, on condition of his declaring \nHenry his successor; that WILLIAM, another son of the King\'s, \nshould inherit his father\'s rightful possessions; and that all the \nCrown lands which Stephen had given away should be recalled, and \nall the Castles he had permitted to be built demolished.  Thus \nterminated the bitter war, which had now lasted fifteen years, and \nhad again laid England waste.  In the next year STEPHEN died, after \na troubled reign of nineteen years.\n\nAlthough King Stephen was, for the time in which he lived, a humane \nand moderate man, with many excellent qualities; and although \nnothing worse is known of him than his usurpation of the Crown, \nwhich he probably excused to himself by the consideration that King \nHenry the First was a usurper too - which was no excuse at all; the \npeople of England suffered more in these dread nineteen years, than \nat any former period even of their suffering history.  In the \ndivision of the nobility between the two rival claimants of the \nCrown, and in the growth of what is called the Feudal System (which \nmade the peasants the born vassals and mere slaves of the Barons), \nevery Noble had his strong Castle, where he reigned the cruel king \nof all the neighbouring people.  Accordingly, he perpetrated \nwhatever cruelties he chose.  And never were worse cruelties \ncommitted upon earth than in wretched England in those nineteen \nyears.\n\nThe writers who were living then describe them fearfully.  They say \nthat the castles were filled with devils rather than with men; that \nthe peasants, men and women, were put into dungeons for their gold \nand silver, were tortured with fire and smoke, were hung up by the \nthumbs, were hung up by the heels with great weights to their \nheads, were torn with jagged irons, killed with hunger, broken to \ndeath in narrow chests filled with sharp-pointed stones, murdered \nin countless fiendish ways.  In England there was no corn, no meat, \nno cheese, no butter, there were no tilled lands, no harvests.  \nAshes of burnt towns, and dreary wastes, were all that the \ntraveller, fearful of the robbers who prowled abroad at all hours, \nwould see in a long day\'s journey; and from sunrise until night, he \nwould not come upon a home.\n\nThe clergy sometimes suffered, and heavily too, from pillage, but \nmany of them had castles of their own, and fought in helmet and \narmour like the barons, and drew lots with other fighting men for \ntheir share of booty.  The Pope (or Bishop of Rome), on King \nStephen\'s resisting his ambition, laid England under an Interdict \nat one period of this reign; which means that he allowed no service \nto be performed in the churches, no couples to be married, no bells \nto be rung, no dead bodies to be buried.  Any man having the power \nto refuse these things, no matter whether he were called a Pope or \na Poulterer, would, of course, have the power of afflicting numbers \nof innocent people.  That nothing might be wanting to the miseries \nof King Stephen\'s time, the Pope threw in this contribution to the \npublic store - not very like the widow\'s contribution, as I think, \nwhen Our Saviour sat in Jerusalem over-against the Treasury, \'and \nshe threw in two mites, which make a farthing.\'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SECOND - PART THE FIRST\n\n\n\nHENRY PLANTAGENET, when he was but twenty-one years old, quietly \nsucceeded to the throne of England, according to his agreement made \nwith the late King at Winchester.  Six weeks after Stephen\'s death, \nhe and his Queen, Eleanor, were crowned in that city; into which \nthey rode on horseback in great state, side by side, amidst much \nshouting and rejoicing, and clashing of music, and strewing of \nflowers.\n\nThe reign of King Henry the Second began well.  The King had great \npossessions, and (what with his own rights, and what with those of \nhis wife) was lord of one-third part of France.  He was a young man \nof vigour, ability, and resolution, and immediately applied himself \nto remove some of the evils which had arisen in the last unhappy \nreign.  He revoked all the grants of land that had been hastily \nmade, on either side, during the late struggles; he obliged numbers \nof disorderly soldiers to depart from England; he reclaimed all the \ncastles belonging to the Crown; and he forced the wicked nobles to \npull down their own castles, to the number of eleven hundred, in \nwhich such dismal cruelties had been inflicted on the people.  The \nKing\'s brother, GEOFFREY, rose against him in France, while he was \nso well employed, and rendered it necessary for him to repair to \nthat country; where, after he had subdued and made a friendly \narrangement with his brother (who did not live long), his ambition \nto increase his possessions involved him in a war with the French \nKing, Louis, with whom he had been on such friendly terms just \nbefore, that to the French King\'s infant daughter, then a baby in \nthe cradle, he had promised one of his little sons in marriage, who \nwas a child of five years old.  However, the war came to nothing at \nlast, and the Pope made the two Kings friends again.\n\nNow, the clergy, in the troubles of the last reign, had gone on \nvery ill indeed.  There were all kinds of criminals among them - \nmurderers, thieves, and vagabonds; and the worst of the matter was, \nthat the good priests would not give up the bad priests to justice, \nwhen they committed crimes, but persisted in sheltering and \ndefending them.  The King, well knowing that there could be no \npeace or rest in England while such things lasted, resolved to \nreduce the power of the clergy; and, when he had reigned seven \nyears, found (as he considered) a good opportunity for doing so, in \nthe death of the Archbishop of Canterbury.  \'I will have for the \nnew Archbishop,\' thought the King, \'a friend in whom I can trust, \nwho will help me to humble these rebellious priests, and to have \nthem dealt with, when they do wrong, as other men who do wrong are \ndealt with.\'  So, he resolved to make his favourite, the new \nArchbishop; and this favourite was so extraordinary a man, and his \nstory is so curious, that I must tell you all about him.\n\nOnce upon a time, a worthy merchant of London, named GILBERT A \nBECKET, made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and was taken prisoner \nby a Saracen lord.  This lord, who treated him kindly and not like \na slave, had one fair daughter, who fell in love with the merchant; \nand who told him that she wanted to become a Christian, and was \nwilling to marry him if they could fly to a Christian country.  The \nmerchant returned her love, until he found an opportunity to \nescape, when he did not trouble himself about the Saracen lady, but \nescaped with his servant Richard, who had been taken prisoner along \nwith him, and arrived in England and forgot her.  The Saracen lady, \nwho was more loving than the merchant, left her father\'s house in \ndisguise to follow him, and made her way, under many hardships, to \nthe sea-shore.  The merchant had taught her only two English words \n(for I suppose he must have learnt the Saracen tongue himself, and \nmade love in that language), of which LONDON was one, and his own \nname, GILBERT, the other.  She went among the ships, saying, \n\'London! London!\' over and over again, until the sailors understood \nthat she wanted to find an English vessel that would carry her \nthere; so they showed her such a ship, and she paid for her passage \nwith some of her jewels, and sailed away.  Well!  The merchant was \nsitting in his counting-house in London one day, when he heard a \ngreat noise in the street; and presently Richard came running in \nfrom the warehouse, with his eyes wide open and his breath almost \ngone, saying, \'Master, master, here is the Saracen lady!\'  The \nmerchant thought Richard was mad; but Richard said, \'No, master!  \nAs I live, the Saracen lady is going up and down the city, calling \nGilbert!  Gilbert!\'  Then, he took the merchant by the sleeve, and \npointed out of window; and there they saw her among the gables and \nwater-spouts of the dark, dirty street, in her foreign dress, so \nforlorn, surrounded by a wondering crowd, and passing slowly along, \ncalling Gilbert, Gilbert!  When the merchant saw her, and thought \nof the tenderness she had shown him in his captivity, and of her \nconstancy, his heart was moved, and he ran down into the street; \nand she saw him coming, and with a great cry fainted in his arms.  \nThey were married without loss of time, and Richard (who was an \nexcellent man) danced with joy the whole day of the wedding; and \nthey all lived happy ever afterwards.\n\nThis merchant and this Saracen lady had one son, THOMAS A BECKET.  \nHe it was who became the Favourite of King Henry the Second.\n\nHe had become Chancellor, when the King thought of making him \nArchbishop.  He was clever, gay, well educated, brave; had fought \nin several battles in France; had defeated a French knight in \nsingle combat, and brought his horse away as a token of the \nvictory.  He lived in a noble palace, he was the tutor of the young \nPrince Henry, he was served by one hundred and forty knights, his \nriches were immense.  The King once sent him as his ambassador to \nFrance; and the French people, beholding in what state he \ntravelled, cried out in the streets, \'How splendid must the King of \nEngland be, when this is only the Chancellor!\'  They had good \nreason to wonder at the magnificence of Thomas a Becket, for, when \nhe entered a French town, his procession was headed by two hundred \nand fifty singing boys; then, came his hounds in couples; then, \neight waggons, each drawn by five horses driven by five drivers:  \ntwo of the waggons filled with strong ale to be given away to the \npeople; four, with his gold and silver plate and stately clothes; \ntwo, with the dresses of his numerous servants.  Then, came twelve \nhorses, each with a monkey on his back; then, a train of people \nbearing shields and leading fine war-horses splendidly equipped; \nthen, falconers with hawks upon their wrists; then, a host of \nknights, and gentlemen and priests; then, the Chancellor with his \nbrilliant garments flashing in the sun, and all the people capering \nand shouting with delight.\n\nThe King was well pleased with all this, thinking that it only made \nhimself the more magnificent to have so magnificent a favourite; \nbut he sometimes jested with the Chancellor upon his splendour too.  \nOnce, when they were riding together through the streets of London \nin hard winter weather, they saw a shivering old man in rags.  \n\'Look at the poor object!\' said the King.  \'Would it not be a \ncharitable act to give that aged man a comfortable warm cloak?\'  \n\'Undoubtedly it would,\' said Thomas a Becket, \'and you do well, \nSir, to think of such Christian duties.\'  \'Come!\' cried the King, \n\'then give him your cloak!\'  It was made of rich crimson trimmed \nwith ermine.  The King tried to pull it off, the Chancellor tried \nto keep it on, both were near rolling from their saddles in the \nmud, when the Chancellor submitted, and the King gave the cloak to \nthe old beggar:  much to the beggar\'s astonishment, and much to the \nmerriment of all the courtiers in attendance.  For, courtiers are \nnot only eager to laugh when the King laughs, but they really do \nenjoy a laugh against a Favourite.\n\n\'I will make,\' thought King Henry the second, \'this Chancellor of \nmine, Thomas a Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury.  He will then be \nthe head of the Church, and, being devoted to me, will help me to \ncorrect the Church.  He has always upheld my power against the \npower of the clergy, and once publicly told some bishops (I \nremember), that men of the Church were equally bound to me, with \nmen of the sword.  Thomas a Becket is the man, of all other men in \nEngland, to help me in my great design.\'  So the King, regardless \nof all objection, either that he was a fighting man, or a lavish \nman, or a courtly man, or a man of pleasure, or anything but a \nlikely man for the office, made him Archbishop accordingly.\n\nNow, Thomas a Becket was proud and loved to be famous.  He was \nalready famous for the pomp of his life, for his riches, his gold \nand silver plate, his waggons, horses, and attendants.  He could do \nno more in that way than he had done; and being tired of that kind \nof fame (which is a very poor one), he longed to have his name \ncelebrated for something else.  Nothing, he knew, would render him \nso famous in the world, as the setting of his utmost power and \nability against the utmost power and ability of the King.  He \nresolved with the whole strength of his mind to do it.\n\nHe may have had some secret grudge against the King besides.  The \nKing may have offended his proud humour at some time or other, for \nanything I know.  I think it likely, because it is a common thing \nfor Kings, Princes, and other great people, to try the tempers of \ntheir favourites rather severely.  Even the little affair of the \ncrimson cloak must have been anything but a pleasant one to a \nhaughty man.  Thomas a Becket knew better than any one in England \nwhat the King expected of him.  In all his sumptuous life, he had \nnever yet been in a position to disappoint the King.  He could take \nup that proud stand now, as head of the Church; and he determined \nthat it should be written in history, either that he subdued the \nKing, or that the King subdued him.\n\nSo, of a sudden, he completely altered the whole manner of his \nlife.  He turned off all his brilliant followers, ate coarse food, \ndrank bitter water, wore next his skin sackcloth covered with dirt \nand vermin (for it was then thought very religious to be very \ndirty), flogged his back to punish himself, lived chiefly in a \nlittle cell, washed the feet of thirteen poor people every day, and \nlooked as miserable as he possibly could.  If he had put twelve \nhundred monkeys on horseback instead of twelve, and had gone in \nprocession with eight thousand waggons instead of eight, he could \nnot have half astonished the people so much as by this great \nchange.  It soon caused him to be more talked about as an \nArchbishop than he had been as a Chancellor.\n\nThe King was very angry; and was made still more so, when the new \nArchbishop, claiming various estates from the nobles as being \nrightfully Church property, required the King himself, for the same \nreason, to give up Rochester Castle, and Rochester City too.  Not \nsatisfied with this, he declared that no power but himself should \nappoint a priest to any Church in the part of England over which he \nwas Archbishop; and when a certain gentleman of Kent made such an \nappointment, as he claimed to have the right to do, Thomas a Becket \nexcommunicated him.\n\nExcommunication was, next to the Interdict I told you of at the \nclose of the last chapter, the great weapon of the clergy.  It \nconsisted in declaring the person who was excommunicated, an \noutcast from the Church and from all religious offices; and in \ncursing him all over, from the top of his head to the sole of his \nfoot, whether he was standing up, lying down, sitting, kneeling, \nwalking, running, hopping, jumping, gaping, coughing, sneezing, or \nwhatever else he was doing.  This unchristian nonsense would of \ncourse have made no sort of difference to the person cursed - who \ncould say his prayers at home if he were shut out of church, and \nwhom none but GOD could judge - but for the fears and superstitions \nof the people, who avoided excommunicated persons, and made their \nlives unhappy.  So, the King said to the New Archbishop, \'Take off \nthis Excommunication from this gentleman of Kent.\'  To which the \nArchbishop replied, \'I shall do no such thing.\'\n\nThe quarrel went on.  A priest in Worcestershire committed a most \ndreadful murder, that aroused the horror of the whole nation.  The \nKing demanded to have this wretch delivered up, to be tried in the \nsame court and in the same way as any other murderer.  The \nArchbishop refused, and kept him in the Bishop\'s prison.  The King, \nholding a solemn assembly in Westminster Hall, demanded that in \nfuture all priests found guilty before their Bishops of crimes \nagainst the law of the land should be considered priests no longer, \nand should be delivered over to the law of the land for punishment.  \nThe Archbishop again refused.  The King required to know whether \nthe clergy would obey the ancient customs of the country?  Every \npriest there, but one, said, after Thomas a Becket, \'Saving my \norder.\'  This really meant that they would only obey those customs \nwhen they did not interfere with their own claims; and the King \nwent out of the Hall in great wrath.\n\nSome of the clergy began to be afraid, now, that they were going \ntoo far.  Though Thomas a Becket was otherwise as unmoved as \nWestminster Hall, they prevailed upon him, for the sake of their \nfears, to go to the King at Woodstock, and promise to observe the \nancient customs of the country, without saying anything about his \norder.  The King received this submission favourably, and summoned \na great council of the clergy to meet at the Castle of Clarendon, \nby Salisbury.  But when the council met, the Archbishop again \ninsisted on the words \'saying my order;\' and he still insisted, \nthough lords entreated him, and priests wept before him and knelt \nto him, and an adjoining room was thrown open, filled with armed \nsoldiers of the King, to threaten him.  At length he gave way, for \nthat time, and the ancient customs (which included what the King \nhad demanded in vain) were stated in writing, and were signed and \nsealed by the chief of the clergy, and were called the \nConstitutions of Clarendon.\n\nThe quarrel went on, for all that.  The Archbishop tried to see the \nKing.  The King would not see him.  The Archbishop tried to escape \nfrom England.  The sailors on the coast would launch no boat to \ntake him away.  Then, he again resolved to do his worst in \nopposition to the King, and began openly to set the ancient customs \nat defiance.\n\nThe King summoned him before a great council at Northampton, where \nhe accused him of high treason, and made a claim against him, which \nwas not a just one, for an enormous sum of money.  Thomas a Becket \nwas alone against the whole assembly, and the very Bishops advised \nhim to resign his office and abandon his contest with the King.  \nHis great anxiety and agitation stretched him on a sick-bed for two \ndays, but he was still undaunted.  He went to the adjourned \ncouncil, carrying a great cross in his right hand, and sat down \nholding it erect before him.  The King angrily retired into an \ninner room.  The whole assembly angrily retired and left him there.  \nBut there he sat.  The Bishops came out again in a body, and \nrenounced him as a traitor.  He only said, \'I hear!\' and sat there \nstill.  They retired again into the inner room, and his trial \nproceeded without him.  By-and-by, the Earl of Leicester, heading \nthe barons, came out to read his sentence.  He refused to hear it, \ndenied the power of the court, and said he would refer his cause to \nthe Pope.  As he walked out of the hall, with the cross in his \nhand, some of those present picked up rushes - rushes were strewn \nupon the floors in those days by way of carpet - and threw them at \nhim.  He proudly turned his head, and said that were he not \nArchbishop, he would chastise those cowards with the sword he had \nknown how to use in bygone days.  He then mounted his horse, and \nrode away, cheered and surrounded by the common people, to whom he \nthrew open his house that night and gave a supper, supping with \nthem himself.  That same night he secretly departed from the town; \nand so, travelling by night and hiding by day, and calling himself \n\'Brother Dearman,\' got away, not without difficulty, to Flanders.\n\nThe struggle still went on.  The angry King took possession of the \nrevenues of the archbishopric, and banished all the relations and \nservants of Thomas a Becket, to the number of four hundred.  The \nPope and the French King both protected him, and an abbey was \nassigned for his residence.  Stimulated by this support, Thomas a \nBecket, on a great festival day, formally proceeded to a great \nchurch crowded with people, and going up into the pulpit publicly \ncursed and excommunicated all who had supported the Constitutions \nof Clarendon:  mentioning many English noblemen by name, and not \ndistantly hinting at the King of England himself.\n\nWhen intelligence of this new affront was carried to the King in \nhis chamber, his passion was so furious that he tore his clothes, \nand rolled like a madman on his bed of straw and rushes.  But he \nwas soon up and doing.  He ordered all the ports and coasts of \nEngland to be narrowly watched, that no letters of Interdict might \nbe brought into the kingdom; and sent messengers and bribes to the \nPope\'s palace at Rome.  Meanwhile, Thomas a Becket, for his part, \nwas not idle at Rome, but constantly employed his utmost arts in \nhis own behalf.  Thus the contest stood, until there was peace \nbetween France and England (which had been for some time at war), \nand until the two children of the two Kings were married in \ncelebration of it.  Then, the French King brought about a meeting \nbetween Henry and his old favourite, so long his enemy.\n\nEven then, though Thomas a Becket knelt before the King, he was \nobstinate and immovable as to those words about his order.  King \nLouis of France was weak enough in his veneration for Thomas a \nBecket and such men, but this was a little too much for him.  He \nsaid that a Becket \'wanted to be greater than the saints and better \nthan St. Peter,\' and rode away from him with the King of England.  \nHis poor French Majesty asked a Becket\'s pardon for so doing, \nhowever, soon afterwards, and cut a very pitiful figure.\n\nAt last, and after a world of trouble, it came to this.  There was \nanother meeting on French ground between King Henry and Thomas a \nBecket, and it was agreed that Thomas a Becket should be Archbishop \nof Canterbury, according to the customs of former Archbishops, and \nthat the King should put him in possession of the revenues of that \npost.  And now, indeed, you might suppose the struggle at an end, \nand Thomas a Becket at rest.  NO, not even yet.  For Thomas a \nBecket hearing, by some means, that King Henry, when he was in \ndread of his kingdom being placed under an interdict, had had his \neldest son Prince Henry secretly crowned, not only persuaded the \nPope to suspend the Archbishop of York who had performed that \nceremony, and to excommunicate the Bishops who had assisted at it, \nbut sent a messenger of his own into England, in spite of all the \nKing\'s precautions along the coast, who delivered the letters of \nexcommunication into the Bishops\' own hands.  Thomas a Becket then \ncame over to England himself, after an absence of seven years.  He \nwas privately warned that it was dangerous to come, and that an \nireful knight, named RANULF DE BROC, had threatened that he should \nnot live to eat a loaf of bread in England; but he came.\n\nThe common people received him well, and marched about with him in \na soldierly way, armed with such rustic weapons as they could get.  \nHe tried to see the young prince who had once been his pupil, but \nwas prevented.  He hoped for some little support among the nobles \nand priests, but found none.  He made the most of the peasants who \nattended him, and feasted them, and went from Canterbury to Harrow-\non-the-Hill, and from Harrow-on-the-Hill back to Canterbury, and on \nChristmas Day preached in the Cathedral there, and told the people \nin his sermon that he had come to die among them, and that it was \nlikely he would be murdered.  He had no fear, however - or, if he \nhad any, he had much more obstinacy - for he, then and there, \nexcommunicated three of his enemies, of whom Ranulf de Broc, the \nireful knight, was one.\n\nAs men in general had no fancy for being cursed, in their sitting \nand walking, and gaping and sneezing, and all the rest of it, it \nwas very natural in the persons so freely excommunicated to \ncomplain to the King.  It was equally natural in the King, who had \nhoped that this troublesome opponent was at last quieted, to fall \ninto a mighty rage when he heard of these new affronts; and, on the \nArchbishop of York telling him that he never could hope for rest \nwhile Thomas a Becket lived, to cry out hastily before his court, \n\'Have I no one here who will deliver me from this man?\'  There were \nfour knights present, who, hearing the King\'s words, looked at one \nanother, and went out.\n\nThe names of these knights were REGINALD FITZURSE, WILLIAM TRACY, \nHUGH DE MORVILLE, and RICHARD BRITO; three of whom had been in the \ntrain of Thomas a Becket in the old days of his splendour.  They \nrode away on horseback, in a very secret manner, and on the third \nday after Christmas Day arrived at Saltwood House, not far from \nCanterbury, which belonged to the family of Ranulf de Broc.  They \nquietly collected some followers here, in case they should need \nany; and proceeding to Canterbury, suddenly appeared (the four \nknights and twelve men) before the Archbishop, in his own house, at \ntwo o\'clock in the afternoon.  They neither bowed nor spoke, but \nsat down on the floor in silence, staring at the Archbishop.\n\nThomas a Becket said, at length, \'What do you want?\'\n\n\'We want,\' said Reginald Fitzurse, \'the excommunication taken from \nthe Bishops, and you to answer for your offences to the King.\'  \nThomas a Becket defiantly replied, that the power of the clergy was \nabove the power of the King.  That it was not for such men as they \nwere, to threaten him.  That if he were threatened by all the \nswords in England, he would never yield.\n\n\'Then we will do more than threaten!\' said the knights.  And they \nwent out with the twelve men, and put on their armour, and drew \ntheir shining swords, and came back.\n\nHis servants, in the meantime, had shut up and barred the great \ngate of the palace.  At first, the knights tried to shatter it with \ntheir battle-axes; but, being shown a window by which they could \nenter, they let the gate alone, and climbed in that way.  While \nthey were battering at the door, the attendants of Thomas a Becket \nhad implored him to take refuge in the Cathedral; in which, as a \nsanctuary or sacred place, they thought the knights would dare to \ndo no violent deed.  He told them, again and again, that he would \nnot stir.  Hearing the distant voices of the monks singing the \nevening service, however, he said it was now his duty to attend, \nand therefore, and for no other reason, he would go.\n\nThere was a near way between his Palace and the Cathedral, by some \nbeautiful old cloisters which you may yet see.  He went into the \nCathedral, without any hurry, and having the Cross carried before \nhim as usual.  When he was safely there, his servants would have \nfastened the door, but he said NO! it was the house of God and not \na fortress.\n\nAs he spoke, the shadow of Reginald Fitzurse appeared in the \nCathedral doorway, darkening the little light there was outside, on \nthe dark winter evening.  This knight said, in a strong voice, \n\'Follow me, loyal servants of the King!\'  The rattle of the armour \nof the other knights echoed through the Cathedral, as they came \nclashing in.\n\nIt was so dark, in the lofty aisles and among the stately pillars \nof the church, and there were so many hiding-places in the crypt \nbelow and in the narrow passages above, that Thomas a Becket might \neven at that pass have saved himself if he would.  But he would \nnot.  He told the monks resolutely that he would not.  And though \nthey all dispersed and left him there with no other follower than \nEDWARD GRYME, his faithful cross-bearer, he was as firm then, as \never he had been in his life.\n\nThe knights came on, through the darkness, making a terrible noise \nwith their armed tread upon the stone pavement of the church.  \n\'Where is the traitor?\' they cried out.  He made no answer.  But \nwhen they cried, \'Where is the Archbishop?\' he said proudly, \'I am \nhere!\' and came out of the shade and stood before them.\n\nThe knights had no desire to kill him, if they could rid the King \nand themselves of him by any other means.  They told him he must \neither fly or go with them.  He said he would do neither; and he \nthrew William Tracy off with such force when he took hold of his \nsleeve, that Tracy reeled again.  By his reproaches and his \nsteadiness, he so incensed them, and exasperated their fierce \nhumour, that Reginald Fitzurse, whom he called by an ill name, \nsaid, \'Then die!\' and struck at his head.  But the faithful Edward \nGryme put out his arm, and there received the main force of the \nblow, so that it only made his master bleed.  Another voice from \namong the knights again called to Thomas a Becket to fly; but, with \nhis blood running down his face, and his hands clasped, and his \nhead bent, he commanded himself to God, and stood firm.  Then they \ncruelly killed him close to the altar of St. Bennet; and his body \nfell upon the pavement, which was dirtied with his blood and \nbrains.\n\nIt is an awful thing to think of the murdered mortal, who had so \nshowered his curses about, lying, all disfigured, in the church, \nwhere a few lamps here and there were but red specks on a pall of \ndarkness; and to think of the guilty knights riding away on \nhorseback, looking over their shoulders at the dim Cathedral, and \nremembering what they had left inside.\n\n\nPART THE SECOND\n\n\nWHEN the King heard how Thomas a Becket had lost his life in \nCanterbury Cathedral, through the ferocity of the four Knights, he \nwas filled with dismay.  Some have supposed that when the King \nspoke those hasty words, \'Have I no one here who will deliver me \nfrom this man?\' he wished, and meant a Becket to be slain.  But few \nthings are more unlikely; for, besides that the King was not \nnaturally cruel (though very passionate), he was wise, and must \nhave known full well what any stupid man in his dominions must have \nknown, namely, that such a murder would rouse the Pope and the \nwhole Church against him.\n\nHe sent respectful messengers to the Pope, to represent his \ninnocence (except in having uttered the hasty words); and he swore \nsolemnly and publicly to his innocence, and contrived in time to \nmake his peace.  As to the four guilty Knights, who fled into \nYorkshire, and never again dared to show themselves at Court, the \nPope excommunicated them; and they lived miserably for some time, \nshunned by all their countrymen.  At last, they went humbly to \nJerusalem as a penance, and there died and were buried.\n\nIt happened, fortunately for the pacifying of the Pope, that an \nopportunity arose very soon after the murder of a Becket, for the \nKing to declare his power in Ireland - which was an acceptable \nundertaking to the Pope, as the Irish, who had been converted to \nChristianity by one Patricius (otherwise Saint Patrick) long ago, \nbefore any Pope existed, considered that the Pope had nothing at \nall to do with them, or they with the Pope, and accordingly refused \nto pay him Peter\'s Pence, or that tax of a penny a house which I \nhave elsewhere mentioned.  The King\'s opportunity arose in this \nway.\n\nThe Irish were, at that time, as barbarous a people as you can well \nimagine.  They were continually quarrelling and fighting, cutting \none another\'s throats, slicing one another\'s noses, burning one \nanother\'s houses, carrying away one another\'s wives, and committing \nall sorts of violence.  The country was divided into five kingdoms \n- DESMOND, THOMOND, CONNAUGHT, ULSTER, and LEINSTER - each governed \nby a separate King, of whom one claimed to be the chief of the \nrest.  Now, one of these Kings, named DERMOND MAC MURROUGH (a wild \nkind of name, spelt in more than one wild kind of way), had carried \noff the wife of a friend of his, and concealed her on an island in \na bog.  The friend resenting this (though it was quite the custom \nof the country), complained to the chief King, and, with the chief \nKing\'s help, drove Dermond Mac Murrough out of his dominions.  \nDermond came over to England for revenge; and offered to hold his \nrealm as a vassal of King Henry, if King Henry would help him to \nregain it.  The King consented to these terms; but only assisted \nhim, then, with what were called Letters Patent, authorising any \nEnglish subjects who were so disposed, to enter into his service, \nand aid his cause.\n\nThere was, at Bristol, a certain EARL RICHARD DE CLARE, called \nSTRONGBOW; of no very good character; needy and desperate, and \nready for anything that offered him a chance of improving his \nfortunes.  There were, in South Wales, two other broken knights of \nthe same good-for-nothing sort, called ROBERT FITZ-STEPHEN, and \nMAURICE FITZ-GERALD.  These three, each with a small band of \nfollowers, took up Dermond\'s cause; and it was agreed that if it \nproved successful, Strongbow should marry Dermond\'s daughter EVA, \nand be declared his heir.\n\nThe trained English followers of these knights were so superior in \nall the discipline of battle to the Irish, that they beat them \nagainst immense superiority of numbers.  In one fight, early in the \nwar, they cut off three hundred heads, and laid them before Mac \nMurrough; who turned them every one up with his hands, rejoicing, \nand, coming to one which was the head of a man whom he had much \ndisliked, grasped it by the hair and ears, and tore off the nose \nand lips with his teeth.  You may judge from this, what kind of a \ngentleman an Irish King in those times was.  The captives, all \nthrough this war, were horribly treated; the victorious party \nmaking nothing of breaking their limbs, and casting them into the \nsea from the tops of high rocks.  It was in the midst of the \nmiseries and cruelties attendant on the taking of Waterford, where \nthe dead lay piled in the streets, and the filthy gutters ran with \nblood, that Strongbow married Eva.  An odious marriage-company \nthose mounds of corpse\'s must have made, I think, and one quite \nworthy of the young lady\'s father.\n\nHe died, after Waterford and Dublin had been taken, and various \nsuccesses achieved; and Strongbow became King of Leinster.  Now \ncame King Henry\'s opportunity.  To restrain the growing power of \nStrongbow, he himself repaired to Dublin, as Strongbow\'s Royal \nMaster, and deprived him of his kingdom, but confirmed him in the \nenjoyment of great possessions.  The King, then, holding state in \nDublin, received the homage of nearly all the Irish Kings and \nChiefs, and so came home again with a great addition to his \nreputation as Lord of Ireland, and with a new claim on the favour \nof the Pope.  And now, their reconciliation was completed - more \neasily and mildly by the Pope, than the King might have expected, I \nthink.\n\nAt this period of his reign, when his troubles seemed so few and \nhis prospects so bright, those domestic miseries began which \ngradually made the King the most unhappy of men, reduced his great \nspirit, wore away his health, and broke his heart.\n\nHe had four sons.  HENRY, now aged eighteen - his secret crowning \nof whom had given such offence to Thomas a Becket.  RICHARD, aged \nsixteen; GEOFFREY, fifteen; and JOHN, his favourite, a young boy \nwhom the courtiers named LACKLAND, because he had no inheritance, \nbut to whom the King meant to give the Lordship of Ireland.  All \nthese misguided boys, in their turn, were unnatural sons to him, \nand unnatural brothers to each other.  Prince Henry, stimulated by \nthe French King, and by his bad mother, Queen Eleanor, began the \nundutiful history,\n\nFirst, he demanded that his young wife, MARGARET, the French King\'s \ndaughter, should be crowned as well as he.  His father, the King, \nconsented, and it was done.  It was no sooner done, than he \ndemanded to have a part of his father\'s dominions, during his \nfather\'s life.  This being refused, he made off from his father in \nthe night, with his bad heart full of bitterness, and took refuge \nat the French King\'s Court.  Within a day or two, his brothers \nRichard and Geoffrey followed.  Their mother tried to join them - \nescaping in man\'s clothes - but she was seized by King Henry\'s men, \nand immured in prison, where she lay, deservedly, for sixteen \nyears.  Every day, however, some grasping English noblemen, to whom \nthe King\'s protection of his people from their avarice and \noppression had given offence, deserted him and joined the Princes.  \nEvery day he heard some fresh intelligence of the Princes levying \narmies against him; of Prince Henry\'s wearing a crown before his \nown ambassadors at the French Court, and being called the Junior \nKing of England; of all the Princes swearing never to make peace \nwith him, their father, without the consent and approval of the \nBarons of France.  But, with his fortitude and energy unshaken, \nKing Henry met the shock of these disasters with a resolved and \ncheerful face.  He called upon all Royal fathers who had sons, to \nhelp him, for his cause was theirs; he hired, out of his riches, \ntwenty thousand men to fight the false French King, who stirred his \nown blood against him; and he carried on the war with such vigour, \nthat Louis soon proposed a conference to treat for peace.\n\nThe conference was held beneath an old wide-spreading green elm-\ntree, upon a plain in France.  It led to nothing.  The war \nrecommenced.  Prince Richard began his fighting career, by leading \nan army against his father; but his father beat him and his army \nback; and thousands of his men would have rued the day in which \nthey fought in such a wicked cause, had not the King received news \nof an invasion of England by the Scots, and promptly come home \nthrough a great storm to repress it.  And whether he really began \nto fear that he suffered these troubles because a Becket had been \nmurdered; or whether he wished to rise in the favour of the Pope, \nwho had now declared a Becket to be a saint, or in the favour of \nhis own people, of whom many believed that even a Becket\'s \nsenseless tomb could work miracles, I don\'t know:  but the King no \nsooner landed in England than he went straight to Canterbury; and \nwhen he came within sight of the distant Cathedral, he dismounted \nfrom his horse, took off his shoes, and walked with bare and \nbleeding feet to a Becket\'s grave.  There, he lay down on the \nground, lamenting, in the presence of many people; and by-and-by he \nwent into the Chapter House, and, removing his clothes from his \nback and shoulders, submitted himself to be beaten with knotted \ncords (not beaten very hard, I dare say though) by eighty Priests, \none after another.  It chanced that on the very day when the King \nmade this curious exhibition of himself, a complete victory was \nobtained over the Scots; which very much delighted the Priests, who \nsaid that it was won because of his great example of repentance.  \nFor the Priests in general had found out, since a Becket\'s death, \nthat they admired him of all things - though they had hated him \nvery cordially when he was alive.\n\nThe Earl of Flanders, who was at the head of the base conspiracy of \nthe King\'s undutiful sons and their foreign friends, took the \nopportunity of the King being thus employed at home, to lay siege \nto Rouen, the capital of Normandy.  But the King, who was \nextraordinarily quick and active in all his movements, was at \nRouen, too, before it was supposed possible that he could have left \nEngland; and there he so defeated the said Earl of Flanders, that \nthe conspirators proposed peace, and his bad sons Henry and \nGeoffrey submitted.  Richard resisted for six weeks; but, being \nbeaten out of castle after castle, he at last submitted too, and \nhis father forgave him.\n\nTo forgive these unworthy princes was only to afford them \nbreathing-time for new faithlessness.  They were so false, \ndisloyal, and dishonourable, that they were no more to be trusted \nthan common thieves.  In the very next year, Prince Henry rebelled \nagain, and was again forgiven.  In eight years more, Prince Richard \nrebelled against his elder brother; and Prince Geoffrey infamously \nsaid that the brothers could never agree well together, unless they \nwere united against their father.  In the very next year after \ntheir reconciliation by the King, Prince Henry again rebelled \nagainst his father; and again submitted, swearing to be true; and \nwas again forgiven; and again rebelled with Geoffrey.\n\nBut the end of this perfidious Prince was come.  He fell sick at a \nFrench town; and his conscience terribly reproaching him with his \nbaseness, he sent messengers to the King his father, imploring him \nto come and see him, and to forgive him for the last time on his \nbed of death.  The generous King, who had a royal and forgiving \nmind towards his children always, would have gone; but this Prince \nhad been so unnatural, that the noblemen about the King suspected \ntreachery, and represented to him that he could not safely trust \nhis life with such a traitor, though his own eldest son.  Therefore \nthe King sent him a ring from off his finger as a token of \nforgiveness; and when the Prince had kissed it, with much grief and \nmany tears, and had confessed to those around him how bad, and \nwicked, and undutiful a son he had been; he said to the attendant \nPriests:  \'O, tie a rope about my body, and draw me out of bed, and \nlay me down upon a bed of ashes, that I may die with prayers to God \nin a repentant manner!\'  And so he died, at twenty-seven years old.\n\nThree years afterwards, Prince Geoffrey, being unhorsed at a \ntournament, had his brains trampled out by a crowd of horses \npassing over him.  So, there only remained Prince Richard, and \nPrince John - who had grown to be a young man now, and had solemnly \nsworn to be faithful to his father.  Richard soon rebelled again, \nencouraged by his friend the French King, PHILIP THE SECOND (son of \nLouis, who was dead); and soon submitted and was again forgiven, \nswearing on the New Testament never to rebel again; and in another \nyear or so, rebelled again; and, in the presence of his father, \nknelt down on his knee before the King of France; and did the \nFrench King homage:  and declared that with his aid he would \npossess himself, by force, of all his father\'s French dominions.\n\nAnd yet this Richard called himself a soldier of Our Saviour!  And \nyet this Richard wore the Cross, which the Kings of France and \nEngland had both taken, in the previous year, at a brotherly \nmeeting underneath the old wide-spreading elm-tree on the plain, \nwhen they had sworn (like him) to devote themselves to a new \nCrusade, for the love and honour of the Truth!\n\nSick at heart, wearied out by the falsehood of his sons, and almost \nready to lie down and die, the unhappy King who had so long stood \nfirm, began to fail.  But the Pope, to his honour, supported him; \nand obliged the French King and Richard, though successful in \nfight, to treat for peace.  Richard wanted to be Crowned King of \nEngland, and pretended that he wanted to be married (which he \nreally did not) to the French King\'s sister, his promised wife, \nwhom King Henry detained in England.  King Henry wanted, on the \nother hand, that the French King\'s sister should be married to his \nfavourite son, John:  the only one of his sons (he said) who had \nnever rebelled against him.  At last King Henry, deserted by his \nnobles one by one, distressed, exhausted, broken-hearted, consented \nto establish peace.\n\nOne final heavy sorrow was reserved for him, even yet.  When they \nbrought him the proposed treaty of peace, in writing, as he lay \nvery ill in bed, they brought him also the list of the deserters \nfrom their allegiance, whom he was required to pardon.  The first \nname upon this list was John, his favourite son, in whom he had \ntrusted to the last.\n\n\'O John! child of my heart!\' exclaimed the King, in a great agony \nof mind.  \'O John, whom I have loved the best!  O John, for whom I \nhave contended through these many troubles!  Have you betrayed me \ntoo!\'  And then he lay down with a heavy groan, and said, \'Now let \nthe world go as it will.  I care for nothing more!\'\n\nAfter a time, he told his attendants to take him to the French town \nof Chinon - a town he had been fond of, during many years.  But he \nwas fond of no place now; it was too true that he could care for \nnothing more upon this earth.  He wildly cursed the hour when he \nwas born, and cursed the children whom he left behind him; and \nexpired.\n\nAs, one hundred years before, the servile followers of the Court \nhad abandoned the Conqueror in the hour of his death, so they now \nabandoned his descendant.  The very body was stripped, in the \nplunder of the Royal chamber; and it was not easy to find the means \nof carrying it for burial to the abbey church of Fontevraud.\n\nRichard was said in after years, by way of flattery, to have the \nheart of a Lion.  It would have been far better, I think, to have \nhad the heart of a Man.  His heart, whatever it was, had cause to \nbeat remorsefully within his breast, when he came - as he did - \ninto the solemn abbey, and looked on his dead father\'s uncovered \nface.  His heart, whatever it was, had been a black and perjured \nheart, in all its dealings with the deceased King, and more \ndeficient in a single touch of tenderness than any wild beast\'s in \nthe forest.\n\nThere is a pretty story told of this Reign, called the story of \nFAIR ROSAMOND.  It relates how the King doted on Fair Rosamond, who \nwas the loveliest girl in all the world; and how he had a beautiful \nBower built for her in a Park at Woodstock; and how it was erected \nin a labyrinth, and could only be found by a clue of silk.  How the \nbad Queen Eleanor, becoming jealous of Fair Rosamond, found out the \nsecret of the clue, and one day, appeared before her, with a dagger \nand a cup of poison, and left her to the choice between those \ndeaths.  How Fair Rosamond, after shedding many piteous tears and \noffering many useless prayers to the cruel Queen, took the poison, \nand fell dead in the midst of the beautiful bower, while the \nunconscious birds sang gaily all around her.\n\nNow, there WAS a fair Rosamond, and she was (I dare say) the \nloveliest girl in all the world, and the King was certainly very \nfond of her, and the bad Queen Eleanor was certainly made jealous.  \nBut I am afraid - I say afraid, because I like the story so much - \nthat there was no bower, no labyrinth, no silken clue, no dagger, \nno poison.  I am afraid fair Rosamond retired to a nunnery near \nOxford, and died there, peaceably; her sister-nuns hanging a silken \ndrapery over her tomb, and often dressing it with flowers, in \nremembrance of the youth and beauty that had enchanted the King \nwhen he too was young, and when his life lay fair before him.\n\nIt was dark and ended now; faded and gone.  Henry Plantagenet lay \nquiet in the abbey church of Fontevraud, in the fifty-seventh year \nof his age - never to be completed - after governing England well, \nfor nearly thirty-five years.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII - ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE FIRST, CALLED THE LION-\nHEART\n\n\n\nIN the year of our Lord one thousand one hundred and eighty-nine, \nRichard of the Lion Heart succeeded to the throne of King Henry the \nSecond, whose paternal heart he had done so much to break.  He had \nbeen, as we have seen, a rebel from his boyhood; but, the moment he \nbecame a king against whom others might rebel, he found out that \nrebellion was a great wickedness.  In the heat of this pious \ndiscovery, he punished all the leading people who had befriended \nhim against his father.  He could scarcely have done anything that \nwould have been a better instance of his real nature, or a better \nwarning to fawners and parasites not to trust in lion-hearted \nprinces.\n\nHe likewise put his late father\'s treasurer in chains, and locked \nhim up in a dungeon from which he was not set free until he had \nrelinquished, not only all the Crown treasure, but all his own \nmoney too.  So, Richard certainly got the Lion\'s share of the \nwealth of this wretched treasurer, whether he had a Lion\'s heart or \nnot.\n\nHe was crowned King of England, with great pomp, at Westminster:  \nwalking to the Cathedral under a silken canopy stretched on the \ntops of four lances, each carried by a great lord.  On the day of \nhis coronation, a dreadful murdering of the Jews took place, which \nseems to have given great delight to numbers of savage persons \ncalling themselves Christians.  The King had issued a proclamation \nforbidding the Jews (who were generally hated, though they were the \nmost useful merchants in England) to appear at the ceremony; but as \nthey had assembled in London from all parts, bringing presents to \nshow their respect for the new Sovereign, some of them ventured \ndown to Westminster Hall with their gifts; which were very readily \naccepted.  It is supposed, now, that some noisy fellow in the \ncrowd, pretending to be a very delicate Christian, set up a howl at \nthis, and struck a Jew who was trying to get in at the Hall door \nwith his present.  A riot arose.  The Jews who had got into the \nHall, were driven forth; and some of the rabble cried out that the \nnew King had commanded the unbelieving race to be put to death.  \nThereupon the crowd rushed through the narrow streets of the city, \nslaughtering all the Jews they met; and when they could find no \nmore out of doors (on account of their having fled to their houses, \nand fastened themselves in), they ran madly about, breaking open \nall the houses where the Jews lived, rushing in and stabbing or \nspearing them, sometimes even flinging old people and children out \nof window into blazing fires they had lighted up below.  This great \ncruelty lasted four-and-twenty hours, and only three men were \npunished for it.  Even they forfeited their lives not for murdering \nand robbing the Jews, but for burning the houses of some \nChristians.\n\nKing Richard, who was a strong, restless, burly man, with one idea \nalways in his head, and that the very troublesome idea of breaking \nthe heads of other men, was mightily impatient to go on a Crusade \nto the Holy Land, with a great army.  As great armies could not be \nraised to go, even to the Holy Land, without a great deal of money, \nhe sold the Crown domains, and even the high offices of State; \nrecklessly appointing noblemen to rule over his English subjects, \nnot because they were fit to govern, but because they could pay \nhigh for the privilege.  In this way, and by selling pardons at a \ndear rate and by varieties of avarice and oppression, he scraped \ntogether a large treasure.  He then appointed two Bishops to take \ncare of his kingdom in his absence, and gave great powers and \npossessions to his brother John, to secure his friendship.  John \nwould rather have been made Regent of England; but he was a sly \nman, and friendly to the expedition; saying to himself, no doubt, \n\'The more fighting, the more chance of my brother being killed; and \nwhen he IS killed, then I become King John!\'\n\nBefore the newly levied army departed from England, the recruits \nand the general populace distinguished themselves by astonishing \ncruelties on the unfortunate Jews:  whom, in many large towns, they \nmurdered by hundreds in the most horrible manner.\n\nAt York, a large body of Jews took refuge in the Castle, in the \nabsence of its Governor, after the wives and children of many of \nthem had been slain before their eyes.  Presently came the \nGovernor, and demanded admission.  \'How can we give it thee, O \nGovernor!\' said the Jews upon the walls, \'when, if we open the gate \nby so much as the width of a foot, the roaring crowd behind thee \nwill press in and kill us?\'\n\nUpon this, the unjust Governor became angry, and told the people \nthat he approved of their killing those Jews; and a mischievous \nmaniac of a friar, dressed all in white, put himself at the head of \nthe assault, and they assaulted the Castle for three days.\n\nThen said JOCEN, the head-Jew (who was a Rabbi or Priest), to the \nrest, \'Brethren, there is no hope for us with the Christians who \nare hammering at the gates and walls, and who must soon break in.  \nAs we and our wives and children must die, either by Christian \nhands, or by our own, let it be by our own.  Let us destroy by fire \nwhat jewels and other treasure we have here, then fire the castle, \nand then perish!\'\n\nA few could not resolve to do this, but the greater part complied.  \nThey made a blazing heap of all their valuables, and, when those \nwere consumed, set the castle in flames.  While the flames roared \nand crackled around them, and shooting up into the sky, turned it \nblood-red, Jocen cut the throat of his beloved wife, and stabbed \nhimself.  All the others who had wives or children, did the like \ndreadful deed.  When the populace broke in, they found (except the \ntrembling few, cowering in corners, whom they soon killed) only \nheaps of greasy cinders, with here and there something like part of \nthe blackened trunk of a burnt tree, but which had lately been a \nhuman creature, formed by the beneficent hand of the Creator as \nthey were.\n\nAfter this bad beginning, Richard and his troops went on, in no \nvery good manner, with the Holy Crusade.  It was undertaken jointly \nby the King of England and his old friend Philip of France.  They \ncommenced the business by reviewing their forces, to the number of \none hundred thousand men.  Afterwards, they severally embarked \ntheir troops for Messina, in Sicily, which was appointed as the \nnext place of meeting.\n\nKing Richard\'s sister had married the King of this place, but he \nwas dead:  and his uncle TANCRED had usurped the crown, cast the \nRoyal Widow into prison, and possessed himself of her estates.  \nRichard fiercely demanded his sister\'s release, the restoration of \nher lands, and (according to the Royal custom of the Island) that \nshe should have a golden chair, a golden table, four-and-twenty \nsilver cups, and four-and-twenty silver dishes.  As he was too \npowerful to be successfully resisted, Tancred yielded to his \ndemands; and then the French King grew jealous, and complained that \nthe English King wanted to be absolute in the Island of Messina and \neverywhere else.  Richard, however, cared little or nothing for \nthis complaint; and in consideration of a present of twenty \nthousand pieces of gold, promised his pretty little nephew ARTHUR, \nthen a child of two years old, in marriage to Tancred\'s daughter.  \nWe shall hear again of pretty little Arthur by-and-by.\n\nThis Sicilian affair arranged without anybody\'s brains being \nknocked out (which must have rather disappointed him), King Richard \ntook his sister away, and also a fair lady named BERENGARIA, with \nwhom he had fallen in love in France, and whom his mother, Queen \nEleanor (so long in prison, you remember, but released by Richard \non his coming to the Throne), had brought out there to be his wife; \nand sailed with them for Cyprus.\n\nHe soon had the pleasure of fighting the King of the Island of \nCyprus, for allowing his subjects to pillage some of the English \ntroops who were shipwrecked on the shore; and easily conquering \nthis poor monarch, he seized his only daughter, to be a companion \nto the lady Berengaria, and put the King himself into silver \nfetters.  He then sailed away again with his mother, sister, wife, \nand the captive princess; and soon arrived before the town of Acre, \nwhich the French King with his fleet was besieging from the sea.  \nBut the French King was in no triumphant condition, for his army \nhad been thinned by the swords of the Saracens, and wasted by the \nplague; and SALADIN, the brave Sultan of the Turks, at the head of \na numerous army, was at that time gallantly defending the place \nfrom the hills that rise above it.\n\nWherever the united army of Crusaders went, they agreed in few \npoints except in gaming, drinking, and quarrelling, in a most \nunholy manner; in debauching the people among whom they tarried, \nwhether they were friends or foes; and in carrying disturbance and \nruin into quiet places.  The French King was jealous of the English \nKing, and the English King was jealous of the French King, and the \ndisorderly and violent soldiers of the two nations were jealous of \none another; consequently, the two Kings could not at first agree, \neven upon a joint assault on Acre; but when they did make up their \nquarrel for that purpose, the Saracens promised to yield the town, \nto give up to the Christians the wood of the Holy Cross, to set at \nliberty all their Christian captives, and to pay two hundred \nthousand pieces of gold.  All this was to be done within forty \ndays; but, not being done, King Richard ordered some three thousand \nSaracen prisoners to be brought out in the front of his camp, and \nthere, in full view of their own countrymen, to be butchered.\n\nThe French King had no part in this crime; for he was by that time \ntravelling homeward with the greater part of his men; being \noffended by the overbearing conduct of the English King; being \nanxious to look after his own dominions; and being ill, besides, \nfrom the unwholesome air of that hot and sandy country.  King \nRichard carried on the war without him; and remained in the East, \nmeeting with a variety of adventures, nearly a year and a half.  \nEvery night when his army was on the march, and came to a halt, the \nheralds cried out three times, to remind all the soldiers of the \ncause in which they were engaged, \'Save the Holy Sepulchre!\' and \nthen all the soldiers knelt and said \'Amen!\'  Marching or \nencamping, the army had continually to strive with the hot air of \nthe glaring desert, or with the Saracen soldiers animated and \ndirected by the brave Saladin, or with both together.  Sickness and \ndeath, battle and wounds, were always among them; but through every \ndifficulty King Richard fought like a giant, and worked like a \ncommon labourer.  Long and long after he was quiet in his grave, \nhis terrible battle-axe, with twenty English pounds of English \nsteel in its mighty head, was a legend among the Saracens; and when \nall the Saracen and Christian hosts had been dust for many a year, \nif a Saracen horse started at any object by the wayside, his rider \nwould exclaim, \'What dost thou fear, Fool?  Dost thou think King \nRichard is behind it?\'\n\nNo one admired this King\'s renown for bravery more than Saladin \nhimself, who was a generous and gallant enemy.  When Richard lay \nill of a fever, Saladin sent him fresh fruits from Damascus, and \nsnow from the mountain-tops.  Courtly messages and compliments were \nfrequently exchanged between them - and then King Richard would \nmount his horse and kill as many Saracens as he could; and Saladin \nwould mount his, and kill as many Christians as he could.  In this \nway King Richard fought to his heart\'s content at Arsoof and at \nJaffa; and finding himself with nothing exciting to do at Ascalon, \nexcept to rebuild, for his own defence, some fortifications there \nwhich the Saracens had destroyed, he kicked his ally the Duke of \nAustria, for being too proud to work at them.\n\nThe army at last came within sight of the Holy City of Jerusalem; \nbut, being then a mere nest of jealousy, and quarrelling and \nfighting, soon retired, and agreed with the Saracens upon a truce \nfor three years, three months, three days, and three hours.  Then, \nthe English Christians, protected by the noble Saladin from Saracen \nrevenge, visited Our Saviour\'s tomb; and then King Richard embarked \nwith a small force at Acre to return home.\n\nBut he was shipwrecked in the Adriatic Sea, and was fain to pass \nthrough Germany, under an assumed name.  Now, there were many \npeople in Germany who had served in the Holy Land under that proud \nDuke of Austria who had been kicked; and some of them, easily \nrecognising a man so remarkable as King Richard, carried their \nintelligence to the kicked Duke, who straightway took him prisoner \nat a little inn near Vienna.\n\nThe Duke\'s master the Emperor of Germany, and the King of France, \nwere equally delighted to have so troublesome a monarch in safe \nkeeping.  Friendships which are founded on a partnership in doing \nwrong, are never true; and the King of France was now quite as \nheartily King Richard\'s foe, as he had ever been his friend in his \nunnatural conduct to his father.  He monstrously pretended that \nKing Richard had designed to poison him in the East; he charged him \nwith having murdered, there, a man whom he had in truth befriended; \nhe bribed the Emperor of Germany to keep him close prisoner; and, \nfinally, through the plotting of these two princes, Richard was \nbrought before the German legislature, charged with the foregoing \ncrimes, and many others.  But he defended himself so well, that \nmany of the assembly were moved to tears by his eloquence and \nearnestness.  It was decided that he should be treated, during the \nrest of his captivity, in a manner more becoming his dignity than \nhe had been, and that he should be set free on the payment of a \nheavy ransom.  This ransom the English people willingly raised.  \nWhen Queen Eleanor took it over to Germany, it was at first evaded \nand refused.  But she appealed to the honour of all the princes of \nthe German Empire in behalf of her son, and appealed so well that \nit was accepted, and the King released.  Thereupon, the King of \nFrance wrote to Prince John - \'Take care of thyself.  The devil is \nunchained!\'\n\nPrince John had reason to fear his brother, for he had been a \ntraitor to him in his captivity.  He had secretly joined the French \nKing; had vowed to the English nobles and people that his brother \nwas dead; and had vainly tried to seize the crown.  He was now in \nFrance, at a place called Evreux.  Being the meanest and basest of \nmen, he contrived a mean and base expedient for making himself \nacceptable to his brother.  He invited the French officers of the \ngarrison in that town to dinner, murdered them all, and then took \nthe fortress.  With this recommendation to the good will of a lion-\nhearted monarch, he hastened to King Richard, fell on his knees \nbefore him, and obtained the intercession of Queen Eleanor.  \'I \nforgive him,\' said the King, \'and I hope I may forget the injury he \nhas done me, as easily as I know he will forget my pardon.\'\n\nWhile King Richard was in Sicily, there had been trouble in his \ndominions at home:  one of the bishops whom he had left in charge \nthereof, arresting the other; and making, in his pride and \nambition, as great a show as if he were King himself.  But the King \nhearing of it at Messina, and appointing a new Regency, this \nLONGCHAMP (for that was his name) had fled to France in a woman\'s \ndress, and had there been encouraged and supported by the French \nKing.  With all these causes of offence against Philip in his mind, \nKing Richard had no sooner been welcomed home by his enthusiastic \nsubjects with great display and splendour, and had no sooner been \ncrowned afresh at Winchester, than he resolved to show the French \nKing that the Devil was unchained indeed, and made war against him \nwith great fury.\n\nThere was fresh trouble at home about this time, arising out of the \ndiscontents of the poor people, who complained that they were far \nmore heavily taxed than the rich, and who found a spirited champion \nin WILLIAM FITZ-OSBERT, called LONGBEARD.  He became the leader of \na secret society, comprising fifty thousand men; he was seized by \nsurprise; he stabbed the citizen who first laid hands upon him; and \nretreated, bravely fighting, to a church, which he maintained four \ndays, until he was dislodged by fire, and run through the body as \nhe came out.  He was not killed, though; for he was dragged, half \ndead, at the tail of a horse to Smithfield, and there hanged.  \nDeath was long a favourite remedy for silencing the people\'s \nadvocates; but as we go on with this history, I fancy we shall find \nthem difficult to make an end of, for all that.\n\nThe French war, delayed occasionally by a truce, was still in \nprogress when a certain Lord named VIDOMAR, Viscount of Limoges, \nchanced to find in his ground a treasure of ancient coins.  As the \nKing\'s vassal, he sent the King half of it; but the King claimed \nthe whole.  The lord refused to yield the whole.  The King besieged \nthe lord in his castle, swore that he would take the castle by \nstorm, and hang every man of its defenders on the battlements.\n\nThere was a strange old song in that part of the country, to the \neffect that in Limoges an arrow would be made by which King Richard \nwould die.  It may be that BERTRAND DE GOURDON, a young man who was \none of the defenders of the castle, had often sung it or heard it \nsung of a winter night, and remembered it when he saw, from his \npost upon the ramparts, the King attended only by his chief officer \nriding below the walls surveying the place.  He drew an arrow to \nthe head, took steady aim, said between his teeth, \'Now I pray God \nspeed thee well, arrow!\' discharged it, and struck the King in the \nleft shoulder.\n\nAlthough the wound was not at first considered dangerous, it was \nsevere enough to cause the King to retire to his tent, and direct \nthe assault to be made without him.  The castle was taken; and \nevery man of its defenders was hanged, as the King had sworn all \nshould be, except Bertrand de Gourdon, who was reserved until the \nroyal pleasure respecting him should be known.\n\nBy that time unskilful treatment had made the wound mortal and the \nKing knew that he was dying.  He directed Bertrand to be brought \ninto his tent.  The young man was brought there, heavily chained, \nKing Richard looked at him steadily.  He looked, as steadily, at \nthe King.\n\n\'Knave!\' said King Richard.  \'What have I done to thee that thou \nshouldest take my life?\'\n\n\'What hast thou done to me?\' replied the young man.  \'With thine \nown hands thou hast killed my father and my two brothers.  Myself \nthou wouldest have hanged.  Let me die now, by any torture that \nthou wilt.  My comfort is, that no torture can save Thee.  Thou too \nmust die; and, through me, the world is quit of thee!\'\n\nAgain the King looked at the young man steadily.  Again the young \nman looked steadily at him.  Perhaps some remembrance of his \ngenerous enemy Saladin, who was not a Christian, came into the mind \nof the dying King.\n\n\'Youth!\' he said, \'I forgive thee.  Go unhurt!\'  Then, turning to \nthe chief officer who had been riding in his company when he \nreceived the wound, King Richard said:\n\n\'Take off his chains, give him a hundred shillings, and let him \ndepart.\'\n\nHe sunk down on his couch, and a dark mist seemed in his weakened \neyes to fill the tent wherein he had so often rested, and he died.  \nHis age was forty-two; he had reigned ten years.  His last command \nwas not obeyed; for the chief officer flayed Bertrand de Gourdon \nalive, and hanged him.\n\nThere is an old tune yet known - a sorrowful air will sometimes \noutlive many generations of strong men, and even last longer than \nbattle-axes with twenty pounds of steel in the head - by which this \nKing is said to have been discovered in his captivity.  BLONDEL, a \nfavourite Minstrel of King Richard, as the story relates, \nfaithfully seeking his Royal master, went singing it outside the \ngloomy walls of many foreign fortresses and prisons; until at last \nhe heard it echoed from within a dungeon, and knew the voice, and \ncried out in ecstasy, \'O Richard, O my King!\'  You may believe it, \nif you like; it would be easy to believe worse things.  Richard was \nhimself a Minstrel and a Poet.  If he had not been a Prince too, he \nmight have been a better man perhaps, and might have gone out of \nthe world with less bloodshed and waste of life to answer for.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV - ENGLAND UNDER KING JOHN, CALLED LACKLAND\n\n\n\nAT two-and-thirty years of age, JOHN became King of England.  His \npretty little nephew ARTHUR had the best claim to the throne; but \nJohn seized the treasure, and made fine promises to the nobility, \nand got himself crowned at Westminster within a few weeks after his \nbrother Richard\'s death.  I doubt whether the crown could possibly \nhave been put upon the head of a meaner coward, or a more \ndetestable villain, if England had been searched from end to end to \nfind him out.\n\nThe French King, Philip, refused to acknowledge the right of John \nto his new dignity, and declared in favour of Arthur.  You must not \nsuppose that he had any generosity of feeling for the fatherless \nboy; it merely suited his ambitious schemes to oppose the King of \nEngland.  So John and the French King went to war about Arthur.\n\nHe was a handsome boy, at that time only twelve years old.  He was \nnot born when his father, Geoffrey, had his brains trampled out at \nthe tournament; and, besides the misfortune of never having known a \nfather\'s guidance and protection, he had the additional misfortune \nto have a foolish mother (CONSTANCE by name), lately married to her \nthird husband.  She took Arthur, upon John\'s accession, to the \nFrench King, who pretended to be very much his friend, and who made \nhim a Knight, and promised him his daughter in marriage; but, who \ncared so little about him in reality, that finding it his interest \nto make peace with King John for a time, he did so without the \nleast consideration for the poor little Prince, and heartlessly \nsacrificed all his interests.\n\nYoung Arthur, for two years afterwards, lived quietly; and in the \ncourse of that time his mother died.  But, the French King then \nfinding it his interest to quarrel with King John again, again made \nArthur his pretence, and invited the orphan boy to court.  \'You \nknow your rights, Prince,\' said the French King, \'and you would \nlike to be a King.  Is it not so?\'  \'Truly,\' said Prince Arthur, \'I \nshould greatly like to be a King!\'  \'Then,\' said Philip, \'you shall \nhave two hundred gentlemen who are Knights of mine, and with them \nyou shall go to win back the provinces belonging to you, of which \nyour uncle, the usurping King of England, has taken possession.  I \nmyself, meanwhile, will head a force against him in Normandy.\'  \nPoor Arthur was so flattered and so grateful that he signed a \ntreaty with the crafty French King, agreeing to consider him his \nsuperior Lord, and that the French King should keep for himself \nwhatever he could take from King John.\n\nNow, King John was so bad in all ways, and King Philip was so \nperfidious, that Arthur, between the two, might as well have been a \nlamb between a fox and a wolf.  But, being so young, he was ardent \nand flushed with hope; and, when the people of Brittany (which was \nhis inheritance) sent him five hundred more knights and five \nthousand foot soldiers, he believed his fortune was made.  The \npeople of Brittany had been fond of him from his birth, and had \nrequested that he might be called Arthur, in remembrance of that \ndimly-famous English Arthur, of whom I told you early in this book, \nwhom they believed to have been the brave friend and companion of \nan old King of their own.  They had tales among them about a \nprophet called MERLIN (of the same old time), who had foretold that \ntheir own King should be restored to them after hundreds of years; \nand they believed that the prophecy would be fulfilled in Arthur; \nthat the time would come when he would rule them with a crown of \nBrittany upon his head; and when neither King of France nor King of \nEngland would have any power over them.  When Arthur found himself \nriding in a glittering suit of armour on a richly caparisoned \nhorse, at the head of his train of knights and soldiers, he began \nto believe this too, and to consider old Merlin a very superior \nprophet.\n\nHe did not know - how could he, being so innocent and \ninexperienced? - that his little army was a mere nothing against \nthe power of the King of England.  The French King knew it; but the \npoor boy\'s fate was little to him, so that the King of England was \nworried and distressed.  Therefore, King Philip went his way into \nNormandy and Prince Arthur went his way towards Mirebeau, a French \ntown near Poictiers, both very well pleased.\n\nPrince Arthur went to attack the town of Mirebeau, because his \ngrandmother Eleanor, who has so often made her appearance in this \nhistory (and who had always been his mother\'s enemy), was living \nthere, and because his Knights said, \'Prince, if you can take her \nprisoner, you will be able to bring the King your uncle to terms!\'  \nBut she was not to be easily taken.  She was old enough by this \ntime - eighty - but she was as full of stratagem as she was full of \nyears and wickedness.  Receiving intelligence of young Arthur\'s \napproach, she shut herself up in a high tower, and encouraged her \nsoldiers to defend it like men.  Prince Arthur with his little army \nbesieged the high tower.  King John, hearing how matters stood, \ncame up to the rescue, with HIS army.  So here was a strange \nfamily-party!  The boy-Prince besieging his grandmother, and his \nuncle besieging him!\n\nThis position of affairs did not last long.  One summer night King \nJohn, by treachery, got his men into the town, surprised Prince \nArthur\'s force, took two hundred of his knights, and seized the \nPrince himself in his bed.  The Knights were put in heavy irons, \nand driven away in open carts drawn by bullocks, to various \ndungeons where they were most inhumanly treated, and where some of \nthem were starved to death.  Prince Arthur was sent to the castle \nof Falaise.\n\nOne day, while he was in prison at that castle, mournfully thinking \nit strange that one so young should be in so much trouble, and \nlooking out of the small window in the deep dark wall, at the \nsummer sky and the birds, the door was softly opened, and he saw \nhis uncle the King standing in the shadow of the archway, looking \nvery grim.\n\n\'Arthur,\' said the King, with his wicked eyes more on the stone \nfloor than on his nephew, \'will you not trust to the gentleness, \nthe friendship, and the truthfulness of your loving uncle?\'\n\n\'I will tell my loving uncle that,\' replied the boy, \'when he does \nme right.  Let him restore to me my kingdom of England, and then \ncome to me and ask the question.\'\n\nThe King looked at him and went out.  \'Keep that boy close \nprisoner,\' said he to the warden of the castle.\n\nThen, the King took secret counsel with the worst of his nobles how \nthe Prince was to be got rid of.  Some said, \'Put out his eyes and \nkeep him in prison, as Robort of Normandy was kept.\'  Others said, \n\'Have him stabbed.\'  Others, \'Have him hanged.\'  Others, \'Have him \npoisoned.\'\n\nKing John, feeling that in any case, whatever was done afterwards, \nit would be a satisfaction to his mind to have those handsome eyes \nburnt out that had looked at him so proudly while his own royal \neyes were blinking at the stone floor, sent certain ruffians to \nFalaise to blind the boy with red-hot irons.  But Arthur so \npathetically entreated them, and shed such piteous tears, and so \nappealed to HUBERT DE BOURG (or BURGH), the warden of the castle, \nwho had a love for him, and was an honourable, tender man, that \nHubert could not bear it.  To his eternal honour he prevented the \ntorture from being performed, and, at his own risk, sent the \nsavages away.\n\nThe chafed and disappointed King bethought himself of the stabbing \nsuggestion next, and, with his shuffling manner and his cruel face, \nproposed it to one William de Bray.  \'I am a gentleman and not an \nexecutioner,\' said William de Bray, and left the presence with \ndisdain.\n\nBut it was not difficult for a King to hire a murderer in those \ndays.  King John found one for his money, and sent him down to the \ncastle of Falaise.  \'On what errand dost thou come?\' said Hubert to \nthis fellow.  \'To despatch young Arthur,\' he returned.  \'Go back to \nhim who sent thee,\' answered Hubert, \'and say that I will do it!\'\n\nKing John very well knowing that Hubert would never do it, but that \nhe courageously sent this reply to save the Prince or gain time, \ndespatched messengers to convey the young prisoner to the castle of \nRouen.\n\nArthur was soon forced from the good Hubert - of whom he had never \nstood in greater need than then - carried away by night, and lodged \nin his new prison:  where, through his grated window, he could hear \nthe deep waters of the river Seine, rippling against the stone wall \nbelow.\n\nOne dark night, as he lay sleeping, dreaming perhaps of rescue by \nthose unfortunate gentlemen who were obscurely suffering and dying \nin his cause, he was roused, and bidden by his jailer to come down \nthe staircase to the foot of the tower.  He hurriedly dressed \nhimself and obeyed.  When they came to the bottom of the winding \nstairs, and the night air from the river blew upon their faces, the \njailer trod upon his torch and put it out.  Then, Arthur, in the \ndarkness, was hurriedly drawn into a solitary boat.  And in that \nboat, he found his uncle and one other man.\n\nHe knelt to them, and prayed them not to murder him.  Deaf to his \nentreaties, they stabbed him and sunk his body in the river with \nheavy stones.  When the spring-morning broke, the tower-door was \nclosed, the boat was gone, the river sparkled on its way, and never \nmore was any trace of the poor boy beheld by mortal eyes.\n\nThe news of this atrocious murder being spread in England, awakened \na hatred of the King (already odious for his many vices, and for \nhis having stolen away and married a noble lady while his own wife \nwas living) that never slept again through his whole reign.  In \nBrittany, the indignation was intense.  Arthur\'s own sister ELEANOR \nwas in the power of John and shut up in a convent at Bristol, but \nhis half-sister ALICE was in Brittany.  The people chose her, and \nthe murdered prince\'s father-in-law, the last husband of Constance, \nto represent them; and carried their fiery complaints to King \nPhilip.  King Philip summoned King John (as the holder of territory \nin France) to come before him and defend himself.  King John \nrefusing to appear, King Philip declared him false, perjured, and \nguilty; and again made war.  In a little time, by conquering the \ngreater part of his French territory, King Philip deprived him of \none-third of his dominions.  And, through all the fighting that \ntook place, King John was always found, either to be eating and \ndrinking, like a gluttonous fool, when the danger was at a \ndistance, or to be running away, like a beaten cur, when it was \nnear.\n\nYou might suppose that when he was losing his dominions at this \nrate, and when his own nobles cared so little for him or his cause \nthat they plainly refused to follow his banner out of England, he \nhad enemies enough.  But he made another enemy of the Pope, which \nhe did in this way.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury dying, and the junior monks of that \nplace wishing to get the start of the senior monks in the \nappointment of his successor, met together at midnight, secretly \nelected a certain REGINALD, and sent him off to Rome to get the \nPope\'s approval.  The senior monks and the King soon finding this \nout, and being very angry about it, the junior monks gave way, and \nall the monks together elected the Bishop of Norwich, who was the \nKing\'s favourite.  The Pope, hearing the whole story, declared that \nneither election would do for him, and that HE elected STEPHEN \nLANGTON.  The monks submitting to the Pope, the King turned them \nall out bodily, and banished them as traitors.  The Pope sent three \nbishops to the King, to threaten him with an Interdict.  The King \ntold the bishops that if any Interdict were laid upon his kingdom, \nhe would tear out the eyes and cut off the noses of all the monks \nhe could lay hold of, and send them over to Rome in that \nundecorated state as a present for their master.  The bishops, \nnevertheless, soon published the Interdict, and fled.\n\nAfter it had lasted a year, the Pope proceeded to his next step; \nwhich was Excommunication.  King John was declared excommunicated, \nwith all the usual ceremonies.  The King was so incensed at this, \nand was made so desperate by the disaffection of his Barons and the \nhatred of his people, that it is said he even privately sent \nambassadors to the Turks in Spain, offering to renounce his \nreligion and hold his kingdom of them if they would help him.  It \nis related that the ambassadors were admitted to the presence of \nthe Turkish Emir through long lines of Moorish guards, and that \nthey found the Emir with his eyes seriously fixed on the pages of a \nlarge book, from which he never once looked up.  That they gave him \na letter from the King containing his proposals, and were gravely \ndismissed.  That presently the Emir sent for one of them, and \nconjured him, by his faith in his religion, to say what kind of man \nthe King of England truly was?  That the ambassador, thus pressed, \nreplied that the King of England was a false tyrant, against whom \nhis own subjects would soon rise.  And that this was quite enough \nfor the Emir.\n\nMoney being, in his position, the next best thing to men, King John \nspared no means of getting it.  He set on foot another oppressing \nand torturing of the unhappy Jews (which was quite in his way), and \ninvented a new punishment for one wealthy Jew of Bristol.  Until \nsuch time as that Jew should produce a certain large sum of money, \nthe King sentenced him to be imprisoned, and, every day, to have \none tooth violently wrenched out of his head - beginning with the \ndouble teeth.  For seven days, the oppressed man bore the daily \npain and lost the daily tooth; but, on the eighth, he paid the \nmoney.  With the treasure raised in such ways, the King made an \nexpedition into Ireland, where some English nobles had revolted.  \nIt was one of the very few places from which he did not run away; \nbecause no resistance was shown.  He made another expedition into \nWales - whence he DID run away in the end:  but not before he had \ngot from the Welsh people, as hostages, twenty-seven young men of \nthe best families; every one of whom he caused to be slain in the \nfollowing year.\n\nTo Interdict and Excommunication, the Pope now added his last \nsentence; Deposition.  He proclaimed John no longer King, absolved \nall his subjects from their allegiance, and sent Stephen Langton \nand others to the King of France to tell him that, if he would \ninvade England, he should be forgiven all his sins - at least, \nshould be forgiven them by the Pope, if that would do.\n\nAs there was nothing that King Philip desired more than to invade \nEngland, he collected a great army at Rouen, and a fleet of \nseventeen hundred ships to bring them over.  But the English \npeople, however bitterly they hated the King, were not a people to \nsuffer invasion quietly.  They flocked to Dover, where the English \nstandard was, in such great numbers to enrol themselves as \ndefenders of their native land, that there were not provisions for \nthem, and the King could only select and retain sixty thousand.  \nBut, at this crisis, the Pope, who had his own reasons for \nobjecting to either King John or King Philip being too powerful, \ninterfered.  He entrusted a legate, whose name was PANDOLF, with \nthe easy task of frightening King John.  He sent him to the English \nCamp, from France, to terrify him with exaggerations of King \nPhilip\'s power, and his own weakness in the discontent of the \nEnglish Barons and people.  Pandolf discharged his commission so \nwell, that King John, in a wretched panic, consented to acknowledge \nStephen Langton; to resign his kingdom \'to God, Saint Peter, and \nSaint Paul\' - which meant the Pope; and to hold it, ever \nafterwards, by the Pope\'s leave, on payment of an annual sum of \nmoney.  To this shameful contract he publicly bound himself in the \nchurch of the Knights Templars at Dover:  where he laid at the \nlegate\'s feet a part of the tribute, which the legate haughtily \ntrampled upon.  But they DO say, that this was merely a genteel \nflourish, and that he was afterwards seen to pick it up and pocket \nit.\n\nThere was an unfortunate prophet, the name of Peter, who had \ngreatly increased King John\'s terrors by predicting that he would \nbe unknighted (which the King supposed to signify that he would \ndie) before the Feast of the Ascension should be past.  That was \nthe day after this humiliation.  When the next morning came, and \nthe King, who had been trembling all night, found himself alive and \nsafe, he ordered the prophet - and his son too - to be dragged \nthrough the streets at the tails of horses, and then hanged, for \nhaving frightened him.\n\nAs King John had now submitted, the Pope, to King Philip\'s great \nastonishment, took him under his protection, and informed King \nPhilip that he found he could not give him leave to invade England.  \nThe angry Philip resolved to do it without his leave but he gained \nnothing and lost much; for, the English, commanded by the Earl of \nSalisbury, went over, in five hundred ships, to the French coast, \nbefore the French fleet had sailed away from it, and utterly \ndefeated the whole.\n\nThe Pope then took off his three sentences, one after another, and \nempowered Stephen Langton publicly to receive King John into the \nfavour of the Church again, and to ask him to dinner.  The King, \nwho hated Langton with all his might and main - and with reason \ntoo, for he was a great and a good man, with whom such a King could \nhave no sympathy - pretended to cry and to be VERY grateful.  There \nwas a little difficulty about settling how much the King should pay \nas a recompense to the clergy for the losses he had caused them; \nbut, the end of it was, that the superior clergy got a good deal, \nand the inferior clergy got little or nothing - which has also \nhappened since King John\'s time, I believe.\n\nWhen all these matters were arranged, the King in his triumph \nbecame more fierce, and false, and insolent to all around him than \nhe had ever been.  An alliance of sovereigns against King Philip, \ngave him an opportunity of landing an army in France; with which he \neven took a town!  But, on the French King\'s gaining a great \nvictory, he ran away, of course, and made a truce for five years.\n\nAnd now the time approached when he was to be still further \nhumbled, and made to feel, if he could feel anything, what a \nwretched creature he was.  Of all men in the world, Stephen Langton \nseemed raised up by Heaven to oppose and subdue him.  When he \nruthlessly burnt and destroyed the property of his own subjects, \nbecause their Lords, the Barons, would not serve him abroad, \nStephen Langton fearlessly reproved and threatened him.  When he \nswore to restore the laws of King Edward, or the laws of King Henry \nthe First, Stephen Langton knew his falsehood, and pursued him \nthrough all his evasions.  When the Barons met at the abbey of \nSaint Edmund\'s-Bury, to consider their wrongs and the King\'s \noppressions, Stephen Langton roused them by his fervid words to \ndemand a solemn charter of rights and liberties from their perjured \nmaster, and to swear, one by one, on the High Altar, that they \nwould have it, or would wage war against him to the death.  When \nthe King hid himself in London from the Barons, and was at last \nobliged to receive them, they told him roundly they would not \nbelieve him unless Stephen Langton became a surety that he would \nkeep his word.  When he took the Cross to invest himself with some \ninterest, and belong to something that was received with favour, \nStephen Langton was still immovable.  When he appealed to the Pope, \nand the Pope wrote to Stephen Langton in behalf of his new \nfavourite, Stephen Langton was deaf, even to the Pope himself, and \nsaw before him nothing but the welfare of England and the crimes of \nthe English King.\n\nAt Easter-time, the Barons assembled at Stamford, in Lincolnshire, \nin proud array, and, marching near to Oxford where the King was, \ndelivered into the hands of Stephen Langton and two others, a list \nof grievances.  \'And these,\' they said, \'he must redress, or we \nwill do it for ourselves!\'  When Stephen Langton told the King as \nmuch, and read the list to him, he went half mad with rage.  But \nthat did him no more good than his afterwards trying to pacify the \nBarons with lies.  They called themselves and their followers, \'The \narmy of God and the Holy Church.\'  Marching through the country, \nwith the people thronging to them everywhere (except at \nNorthampton, where they failed in an attack upon the castle), they \nat last triumphantly set up their banner in London itself, whither \nthe whole land, tired of the tyrant, seemed to flock to join them.  \nSeven knights alone, of all the knights in England, remained with \nthe King; who, reduced to this strait, at last sent the Earl of \nPembroke to the Barons to say that he approved of everything, and \nwould meet them to sign their charter when they would.  \'Then,\' \nsaid the Barons, \'let the day be the fifteenth of June, and the \nplace, Runny-Mead.\'\n\nOn Monday, the fifteenth of June, one thousand two hundred and \nfourteen, the King came from Windsor Castle, and the Barons came \nfrom the town of Staines, and they met on Runny-Mead, which is \nstill a pleasant meadow by the Thames, where rushes grow in the \nclear water of the winding river, and its banks are green with \ngrass and trees.  On the side of the Barons, came the General of \ntheir army, ROBERT FITZ-WALTER, and a great concourse of the \nnobility of England.  With the King, came, in all, some four-and-\ntwenty persons of any note, most of whom despised him, and were \nmerely his advisers in form.  On that great day, and in that great \ncompany, the King signed MAGNA CHARTA - the great charter of \nEngland - by which he pledged himself to maintain the Church in its \nrights; to relieve the Barons of oppressive obligations as vassals \nof the Crown - of which the Barons, in their turn, pledged \nthemselves to relieve THEIR vassals, the people; to respect the \nliberties of London and all other cities and boroughs; to protect \nforeign merchants who came to England; to imprison no man without a \nfair trial; and to sell, delay, or deny justice to none.  As the \nBarons knew his falsehood well, they further required, as their \nsecurities, that he should send out of his kingdom all his foreign \ntroops; that for two months they should hold possession of the city \nof London, and Stephen Langton of the Tower; and that five-and-\ntwenty of their body, chosen by themselves, should be a lawful \ncommittee to watch the keeping of the charter, and to make war upon \nhim if he broke it.\n\nAll this he was obliged to yield.  He signed the charter with a \nsmile, and, if he could have looked agreeable, would have done so, \nas he departed from the splendid assembly.  When he got home to \nWindsor Castle, he was quite a madman in his helpless fury.  And he \nbroke the charter immediately afterwards.\n\nHe sent abroad for foreign soldiers, and sent to the Pope for help, \nand plotted to take London by surprise, while the Barons should be \nholding a great tournament at Stamford, which they had agreed to \nhold there as a celebration of the charter.  The Barons, however, \nfound him out and put it off.  Then, when the Barons desired to see \nhim and tax him with his treachery, he made numbers of appointments \nwith them, and kept none, and shifted from place to place, and was \nconstantly sneaking and skulking about.  At last he appeared at \nDover, to join his foreign soldiers, of whom numbers came into his \npay; and with them he besieged and took Rochester Castle, which was \noccupied by knights and soldiers of the Barons.  He would have \nhanged them every one; but the leader of the foreign soldiers, \nfearful of what the English people might afterwards do to him, \ninterfered to save the knights; therefore the King was fain to \nsatisfy his vengeance with the death of all the common men.  Then, \nhe sent the Earl of Salisbury, with one portion of his army, to \nravage the eastern part of his own dominions, while he carried fire \nand slaughter into the northern part; torturing, plundering, \nkilling, and inflicting every possible cruelty upon the people; \nand, every morning, setting a worthy example to his men by setting \nfire, with his own monster-hands, to the house where he had slept \nlast night.  Nor was this all; for the Pope, coming to the aid of \nhis precious friend, laid the kingdom under an Interdict again, \nbecause the people took part with the Barons.  It did not much \nmatter, for the people had grown so used to it now, that they had \nbegun to think nothing about it.  It occurred to them - perhaps to \nStephen Langton too - that they could keep their churches open, and \nring their bells, without the Pope\'s permission as well as with it.  \nSo, they tried the experiment - and found that it succeeded \nperfectly.\n\nIt being now impossible to bear the country, as a wilderness of \ncruelty, or longer to hold any terms with such a forsworn outlaw of \na King, the Barons sent to Louis, son of the French monarch, to \noffer him the English crown.  Caring as little for the Pope\'s \nexcommunication of him if he accepted the offer, as it is possible \nhis father may have cared for the Pope\'s forgiveness of his sins, \nhe landed at Sandwich (King John immediately running away from \nDover, where he happened to be), and went on to London.  The \nScottish King, with whom many of the Northern English Lords had \ntaken refuge; numbers of the foreign soldiers, numbers of the \nBarons, and numbers of the people went over to him every day; - \nKing John, the while, continually running away in all directions.\n\nThe career of Louis was checked however, by the suspicions of the \nBarons, founded on the dying declaration of a French Lord, that \nwhen the kingdom was conquered he was sworn to banish them as \ntraitors, and to give their estates to some of his own Nobles.  \nRather than suffer this, some of the Barons hesitated:  others even \nwent over to King John.\n\nIt seemed to be the turning-point of King John\'s fortunes, for, in \nhis savage and murderous course, he had now taken some towns and \nmet with some successes.  But, happily for England and humanity, \nhis death was near.  Crossing a dangerous quicksand, called the \nWash, not very far from Wisbeach, the tide came up and nearly \ndrowned his army.  He and his soldiers escaped; but, looking back \nfrom the shore when he was safe, he saw the roaring water sweep \ndown in a torrent, overturn the waggons, horses, and men, that \ncarried his treasure, and engulf them in a raging whirlpool from \nwhich nothing could be delivered.\n\nCursing, and swearing, and gnawing his fingers, he went on to \nSwinestead Abbey, where the monks set before him quantities of \npears, and peaches, and new cider - some say poison too, but there \nis very little reason to suppose so - of which he ate and drank in \nan immoderate and beastly way.  All night he lay ill of a burning \nfever, and haunted with horrible fears.  Next day, they put him in \na horse-litter, and carried him to Sleaford Castle, where he passed \nanother night of pain and horror.  Next day, they carried him, with \ngreater difficulty than on the day before, to the castle of Newark \nupon Trent; and there, on the eighteenth of October, in the forty-\nninth year of his age, and the seventeenth of his vile reign, was \nan end of this miserable brute.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE THIRD, CALLED, OF WINCHESTER\n\n\n\nIF any of the English Barons remembered the murdered Arthur\'s \nsister, Eleanor the fair maid of Brittany, shut up in her convent \nat Bristol, none among them spoke of her now, or maintained her \nright to the Crown.  The dead Usurper\'s eldest boy, HENRY by name, \nwas taken by the Earl of Pembroke, the Marshal of England, to the \ncity of Gloucester, and there crowned in great haste when he was \nonly ten years old.  As the Crown itself had been lost with the \nKing\'s treasure in the raging water, and as there was no time to \nmake another, they put a circle of plain gold upon his head \ninstead.  \'We have been the enemies of this child\'s father,\' said \nLord Pembroke, a good and true gentleman, to the few Lords who were \npresent, \'and he merited our ill-will; but the child himself is \ninnocent, and his youth demands our friendship and protection.\'  \nThose Lords felt tenderly towards the little boy, remembering their \nown young children; and they bowed their heads, and said, \'Long \nlive King Henry the Third!\'\n\nNext, a great council met at Bristol, revised Magna Charta, and \nmade Lord Pembroke Regent or Protector of England, as the King was \ntoo young to reign alone.  The next thing to be done, was to get \nrid of Prince Louis of France, and to win over those English Barons \nwho were still ranged under his banner.  He was strong in many \nparts of England, and in London itself; and he held, among other \nplaces, a certain Castle called the Castle of Mount Sorel, in \nLeicestershire.  To this fortress, after some skirmishing and \ntruce-making, Lord Pembroke laid siege.  Louis despatched an army \nof six hundred knights and twenty thousand soldiers to relieve it.  \nLord Pembroke, who was not strong enough for such a force, retired \nwith all his men.  The army of the French Prince, which had marched \nthere with fire and plunder, marched away with fire and plunder, \nand came, in a boastful swaggering manner, to Lincoln.  The town \nsubmitted; but the Castle in the town, held by a brave widow lady, \nnamed NICHOLA DE CAMVILLE (whose property it was), made such a \nsturdy resistance, that the French Count in command of the army of \nthe French Prince found it necessary to besiege this Castle.  While \nhe was thus engaged, word was brought to him that Lord Pembroke, \nwith four hundred knights, two hundred and fifty men with cross-\nbows, and a stout force both of horse and foot, was marching \ntowards him.  \'What care I?\' said the French Count.  \'The \nEnglishman is not so mad as to attack me and my great army in a \nwalled town!\'  But the Englishman did it for all that, and did it - \nnot so madly but so wisely, that he decoyed the great army into the \nnarrow, ill-paved lanes and byways of Lincoln, where its horse-\nsoldiers could not ride in any strong body; and there he made such \nhavoc with them, that the whole force surrendered themselves \nprisoners, except the Count; who said that he would never yield to \nany English traitor alive, and accordingly got killed.  The end of \nthis victory, which the English called, for a joke, the Fair of \nLincoln, was the usual one in those times - the common men were \nslain without any mercy, and the knights and gentlemen paid ransom \nand went home.\n\nThe wife of Louis, the fair BLANCHE OF CASTILE, dutifully equipped \na fleet of eighty good ships, and sent it over from France to her \nhusband\'s aid.  An English fleet of forty ships, some good and some \nbad, gallantly met them near the mouth of the Thames, and took or \nsunk sixty-five in one fight.  This great loss put an end to the \nFrench Prince\'s hopes.  A treaty was made at Lambeth, in virtue of \nwhich the English Barons who had remained attached to his cause \nreturned to their allegiance, and it was engaged on both sides that \nthe Prince and all his troops should retire peacefully to France.  \nIt was time to go; for war had made him so poor that he was obliged \nto borrow money from the citizens of London to pay his expenses \nhome.\n\nLord Pembroke afterwards applied himself to governing the country \njustly, and to healing the quarrels and disturbances that had \narisen among men in the days of the bad King John.  He caused Magna \nCharta to be still more improved, and so amended the Forest Laws \nthat a Peasant was no longer put to death for killing a stag in a \nRoyal Forest, but was only imprisoned.  It would have been well for \nEngland if it could have had so good a Protector many years longer, \nbut that was not to be.  Within three years after the young King\'s \nCoronation, Lord Pembroke died; and you may see his tomb, at this \nday, in the old Temple Church in London.\n\nThe Protectorship was now divided.  PETER DE ROCHES, whom King John \nhad made Bishop of Winchester, was entrusted with the care of the \nperson of the young sovereign; and the exercise of the Royal \nauthority was confided to EARL HUBERT DE BURGH.  These two \npersonages had from the first no liking for each other, and soon \nbecame enemies.  When the young King was declared of age, Peter de \nRoches, finding that Hubert increased in power and favour, retired \ndiscontentedly, and went abroad.  For nearly ten years afterwards \nHubert had full sway alone.\n\nBut ten years is a long time to hold the favour of a King.  This \nKing, too, as he grew up, showed a strong resemblance to his \nfather, in feebleness, inconsistency, and irresolution.  The best \nthat can be said of him is that he was not cruel.  De Roches coming \nhome again, after ten years, and being a novelty, the King began to \nfavour him and to look coldly on Hubert.  Wanting money besides, \nand having made Hubert rich, he began to dislike Hubert.  At last \nhe was made to believe, or pretended to believe, that Hubert had \nmisappropriated some of the Royal treasure; and ordered him to \nfurnish an account of all he had done in his administration.  \nBesides which, the foolish charge was brought against Hubert that \nhe had made himself the King\'s favourite by magic.  Hubert very \nwell knowing that he could never defend himself against such \nnonsense, and that his old enemy must be determined on his ruin, \ninstead of answering the charges fled to Merton Abbey.  Then the \nKing, in a violent passion, sent for the Mayor of London, and said \nto the Mayor, \'Take twenty thousand citizens, and drag me Hubert de \nBurgh out of that abbey, and bring him here.\'  The Mayor posted off \nto do it, but the Archbishop of Dublin (who was a friend of \nHubert\'s) warning the King that an abbey was a sacred place, and \nthat if he committed any violence there, he must answer for it to \nthe Church, the King changed his mind and called the Mayor back, \nand declared that Hubert should have four months to prepare his \ndefence, and should be safe and free during that time.\n\nHubert, who relied upon the King\'s word, though I think he was old \nenough to have known better, came out of Merton Abbey upon these \nconditions, and journeyed away to see his wife:  a Scottish \nPrincess who was then at St. Edmund\'s-Bury.\n\nAlmost as soon as he had departed from the Sanctuary, his enemies \npersuaded the weak King to send out one SIR GODFREY DE CRANCUMB, \nwho commanded three hundred vagabonds called the Black Band, with \norders to seize him.  They came up with him at a little town in \nEssex, called Brentwood, when he was in bed.  He leaped out of bed, \ngot out of the house, fled to the church, ran up to the altar, and \nlaid his hand upon the cross.  Sir Godfrey and the Black Band, \ncaring neither for church, altar, nor cross, dragged him forth to \nthe church door, with their drawn swords flashing round his head, \nand sent for a Smith to rivet a set of chains upon him.  When the \nSmith (I wish I knew his name!) was brought, all dark and swarthy \nwith the smoke of his forge, and panting with the speed he had \nmade; and the Black Band, falling aside to show him the Prisoner, \ncried with a loud uproar, \'Make the fetters heavy! make them \nstrong!\' the Smith dropped upon his knee - but not to the Black \nBand - and said, \'This is the brave Earl Hubert de Burgh, who \nfought at Dover Castle, and destroyed the French fleet, and has \ndone his country much good service.  You may kill me, if you like, \nbut I will never make a chain for Earl Hubert de Burgh!\'\n\nThe Black Band never blushed, or they might have blushed at this.  \nThey knocked the Smith about from one to another, and swore at him, \nand tied the Earl on horseback, undressed as he was, and carried \nhim off to the Tower of London.  The Bishops, however, were so \nindignant at the violation of the Sanctuary of the Church, that the \nfrightened King soon ordered the Black Band to take him back again; \nat the same time commanding the Sheriff of Essex to prevent his \nescaping out of Brentwood Church.  Well! the Sheriff dug a deep \ntrench all round the church, and erected a high fence, and watched \nthe church night and day; the Black Band and their Captain watched \nit too, like three hundred and one black wolves.  For thirty-nine \ndays, Hubert de Burgh remained within.  At length, upon the \nfortieth day, cold and hunger were too much for him, and he gave \nhimself up to the Black Band, who carried him off, for the second \ntime, to the Tower.  When his trial came on, he refused to plead; \nbut at last it was arranged that he should give up all the royal \nlands which had been bestowed upon him, and should be kept at the \nCastle of Devizes, in what was called \'free prison,\' in charge of \nfour knights appointed by four lords.  There, he remained almost a \nyear, until, learning that a follower of his old enemy the Bishop \nwas made Keeper of the Castle, and fearing that he might be killed \nby treachery, he climbed the ramparts one dark night, dropped from \nthe top of the high Castle wall into the moat, and coming safely to \nthe ground, took refuge in another church.  From this place he was \ndelivered by a party of horse despatched to his help by some \nnobles, who were by this time in revolt against the King, and \nassembled in Wales.  He was finally pardoned and restored to his \nestates, but he lived privately, and never more aspired to a high \npost in the realm, or to a high place in the King\'s favour.  And \nthus end - more happily than the stories of many favourites of \nKings - the adventures of Earl Hubert de Burgh.\n\nThe nobles, who had risen in revolt, were stirred up to rebellion \nby the overbearing conduct of the Bishop of Winchester, who, \nfinding that the King secretly hated the Great Charter which had \nbeen forced from his father, did his utmost to confirm him in that \ndislike, and in the preference he showed to foreigners over the \nEnglish.  Of this, and of his even publicly declaring that the \nBarons of England were inferior to those of France, the English \nLords complained with such bitterness, that the King, finding them \nwell supported by the clergy, became frightened for his throne, and \nsent away the Bishop and all his foreign associates.  On his \nmarriage, however, with ELEANOR, a French lady, the daughter of the \nCount of Provence, he openly favoured the foreigners again; and so \nmany of his wife\'s relations came over, and made such an immense \nfamily-party at court, and got so many good things, and pocketed so \nmuch money, and were so high with the English whose money they \npocketed, that the bolder English Barons murmured openly about a \nclause there was in the Great Charter, which provided for the \nbanishment of unreasonable favourites.  But, the foreigners only \nlaughed disdainfully, and said, \'What are your English laws to us?\'\n\nKing Philip of France had died, and had been succeeded by Prince \nLouis, who had also died after a short reign of three years, and \nhad been succeeded by his son of the same name - so moderate and \njust a man that he was not the least in the world like a King, as \nKings went.  ISABELLA, King Henry\'s mother, wished very much (for a \ncertain spite she had) that England should make war against this \nKing; and, as King Henry was a mere puppet in anybody\'s hands who \nknew how to manage his feebleness, she easily carried her point \nwith him.  But, the Parliament were determined to give him no money \nfor such a war.  So, to defy the Parliament, he packed up thirty \nlarge casks of silver - I don\'t know how he got so much; I dare say \nhe screwed it out of the miserable Jews - and put them aboard ship, \nand went away himself to carry war into France:  accompanied by his \nmother and his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall, who was rich and \nclever.  But he only got well beaten, and came home.\n\nThe good-humour of the Parliament was not restored by this.  They \nreproached the King with wasting the public money to make greedy \nforeigners rich, and were so stern with him, and so determined not \nto let him have more of it to waste if they could help it, that he \nwas at his wit\'s end for some, and tried so shamelessly to get all \nhe could from his subjects, by excuses or by force, that the people \nused to say the King was the sturdiest beggar in England.  He took \nthe Cross, thinking to get some money by that means; but, as it was \nvery well known that he never meant to go on a crusade, he got \nnone.  In all this contention, the Londoners were particularly keen \nagainst the King, and the King hated them warmly in return.  Hating \nor loving, however, made no difference; he continued in the same \ncondition for nine or ten years, when at last the Barons said that \nif he would solemnly confirm their liberties afresh, the Parliament \nwould vote him a large sum.\n\nAs he readily consented, there was a great meeting held in \nWestminster Hall, one pleasant day in May, when all the clergy, \ndressed in their robes and holding every one of them a burning \ncandle in his hand, stood up (the Barons being also there) while \nthe Archbishop of Canterbury read the sentence of excommunication \nagainst any man, and all men, who should henceforth, in any way, \ninfringe the Great Charter of the Kingdom.  When he had done, they \nall put out their burning candles with a curse upon the soul of any \none, and every one, who should merit that sentence.  The King \nconcluded with an oath to keep the Charter, \'As I am a man, as I am \na Christian, as I am a Knight, as I am a King!\'\n\nIt was easy to make oaths, and easy to break them; and the King did \nboth, as his father had done before him.  He took to his old \ncourses again when he was supplied with money, and soon cured of \ntheir weakness the few who had ever really trusted him.  When his \nmoney was gone, and he was once more borrowing and begging \neverywhere with a meanness worthy of his nature, he got into a \ndifficulty with the Pope respecting the Crown of Sicily, which the \nPope said he had a right to give away, and which he offered to King \nHenry for his second son, PRINCE EDMUND.  But, if you or I give \naway what we have not got, and what belongs to somebody else, it is \nlikely that the person to whom we give it, will have some trouble \nin taking it.  It was exactly so in this case.  It was necessary to \nconquer the Sicilian Crown before it could be put upon young \nEdmund\'s head.  It could not be conquered without money.  The Pope \nordered the clergy to raise money.  The clergy, however, were not \nso obedient to him as usual; they had been disputing with him for \nsome time about his unjust preference of Italian Priests in \nEngland; and they had begun to doubt whether the King\'s chaplain, \nwhom he allowed to be paid for preaching in seven hundred churches, \ncould possibly be, even by the Pope\'s favour, in seven hundred \nplaces at once.  \'The Pope and the King together,\' said the Bishop \nof London, \'may take the mitre off my head; but, if they do, they \nwill find that I shall put on a soldier\'s helmet.  I pay nothing.\'  \nThe Bishop of Worcester was as bold as the Bishop of London, and \nwould pay nothing either.  Such sums as the more timid or more \nhelpless of the clergy did raise were squandered away, without \ndoing any good to the King, or bringing the Sicilian Crown an inch \nnearer to Prince Edmund\'s head.  The end of the business was, that \nthe Pope gave the Crown to the brother of the King of France (who \nconquered it for himself), and sent the King of England in, a bill \nof one hundred thousand pounds for the expenses of not having won \nit.\n\nThe King was now so much distressed that we might almost pity him, \nif it were possible to pity a King so shabby and ridiculous.  His \nclever brother, Richard, had bought the title of King of the Romans \nfrom the German people, and was no longer near him, to help him \nwith advice.  The clergy, resisting the very Pope, were in alliance \nwith the Barons.  The Barons were headed by SIMON DE MONTFORT, Earl \nof Leicester, married to King Henry\'s sister, and, though a \nforeigner himself, the most popular man in England against the \nforeign favourites.  When the King next met his Parliament, the \nBarons, led by this Earl, came before him, armed from head to foot, \nand cased in armour.  When the Parliament again assembled, in a \nmonth\'s time, at Oxford, this Earl was at their head, and the King \nwas obliged to consent, on oath, to what was called a Committee of \nGovernment:  consisting of twenty-four members:  twelve chosen by \nthe Barons, and twelve chosen by himself.\n\nBut, at a good time for him, his brother Richard came back.  \nRichard\'s first act (the Barons would not admit him into England on \nother terms) was to swear to be faithful to the Committee of \nGovernment - which he immediately began to oppose with all his \nmight.  Then, the Barons began to quarrel among themselves; \nespecially the proud Earl of Gloucester with the Earl of Leicester, \nwho went abroad in disgust.  Then, the people began to be \ndissatisfied with the Barons, because they did not do enough for \nthem.  The King\'s chances seemed so good again at length, that he \ntook heart enough - or caught it from his brother - to tell the \nCommittee of Government that he abolished them - as to his oath, \nnever mind that, the Pope said! - and to seize all the money in the \nMint, and to shut himself up in the Tower of London.  Here he was \njoined by his eldest son, Prince Edward; and, from the Tower, he \nmade public a letter of the Pope\'s to the world in general, \ninforming all men that he had been an excellent and just King for \nfive-and-forty years.\n\nAs everybody knew he had been nothing of the sort, nobody cared \nmuch for this document.  It so chanced that the proud Earl of \nGloucester dying, was succeeded by his son; and that his son, \ninstead of being the enemy of the Earl of Leicester, was (for the \ntime) his friend.  It fell out, therefore, that these two Earls \njoined their forces, took several of the Royal Castles in the \ncountry, and advanced as hard as they could on London.  The London \npeople, always opposed to the King, declared for them with great \njoy.  The King himself remained shut up, not at all gloriously, in \nthe Tower.  Prince Edward made the best of his way to Windsor \nCastle.  His mother, the Queen, attempted to follow him by water; \nbut, the people seeing her barge rowing up the river, and hating \nher with all their hearts, ran to London Bridge, got together a \nquantity of stones and mud, and pelted the barge as it came \nthrough, crying furiously, \'Drown the Witch!  Drown her!\'  They \nwere so near doing it, that the Mayor took the old lady under his \nprotection, and shut her up in St. Paul\'s until the danger was \npast.\n\nIt would require a great deal of writing on my part, and a great \ndeal of reading on yours, to follow the King through his disputes \nwith the Barons, and to follow the Barons through their disputes \nwith one another - so I will make short work of it for both of us, \nand only relate the chief events that arose out of these quarrels.  \nThe good King of France was asked to decide between them.  He gave \nit as his opinion that the King must maintain the Great Charter, \nand that the Barons must give up the Committee of Government, and \nall the rest that had been done by the Parliament at Oxford:  which \nthe Royalists, or King\'s party, scornfully called the Mad \nParliament.  The Barons declared that these were not fair terms, \nand they would not accept them.  Then they caused the great bell of \nSt. Paul\'s to be tolled, for the purpose of rousing up the London \npeople, who armed themselves at the dismal sound and formed quite \nan army in the streets.  I am sorry to say, however, that instead \nof falling upon the King\'s party with whom their quarrel was, they \nfell upon the miserable Jews, and killed at least five hundred of \nthem.  They pretended that some of these Jews were on the King\'s \nside, and that they kept hidden in their houses, for the \ndestruction of the people, a certain terrible composition called \nGreek Fire, which could not be put out with water, but only burnt \nthe fiercer for it.  What they really did keep in their houses was \nmoney; and this their cruel enemies wanted, and this their cruel \nenemies took, like robbers and murderers.\n\nThe Earl of Leicester put himself at the head of these Londoners \nand other forces, and followed the King to Lewes in Sussex, where \nhe lay encamped with his army.  Before giving the King\'s forces \nbattle here, the Earl addressed his soldiers, and said that King \nHenry the Third had broken so many oaths, that he had become the \nenemy of God, and therefore they would wear white crosses on their \nbreasts, as if they were arrayed, not against a fellow-Christian, \nbut against a Turk.  White-crossed accordingly, they rushed into \nthe fight.  They would have lost the day - the King having on his \nside all the foreigners in England:  and, from Scotland, JOHN \nCOMYN, JOHN BALIOL, and ROBERT BRUCE, with all their men - but for \nthe impatience of PRINCE EDWARD, who, in his hot desire to have \nvengeance on the people of London, threw the whole of his father\'s \narmy into confusion.  He was taken Prisoner; so was the King; so \nwas the King\'s brother the King of the Romans; and five thousand \nEnglishmen were left dead upon the bloody grass.\n\nFor this success, the Pope excommunicated the Earl of Leicester:  \nwhich neither the Earl nor the people cared at all about.  The \npeople loved him and supported him, and he became the real King; \nhaving all the power of the government in his own hands, though he \nwas outwardly respectful to King Henry the Third, whom he took with \nhim wherever he went, like a poor old limp court-card.  He summoned \na Parliament (in the year one thousand two hundred and sixty-five) \nwhich was the first Parliament in England that the people had any \nreal share in electing; and he grew more and more in favour with \nthe people every day, and they stood by him in whatever he did.\n\nMany of the other Barons, and particularly the Earl of Gloucester, \nwho had become by this time as proud as his father, grew jealous of \nthis powerful and popular Earl, who was proud too, and began to \nconspire against him.  Since the battle of Lewes, Prince Edward had \nbeen kept as a hostage, and, though he was otherwise treated like a \nPrince, had never been allowed to go out without attendants \nappointed by the Earl of Leicester, who watched him.  The \nconspiring Lords found means to propose to him, in secret, that \nthey should assist him to escape, and should make him their leader; \nto which he very heartily consented.\n\nSo, on a day that was agreed upon, he said to his attendants after \ndinner (being then at Hereford), \'I should like to ride on \nhorseback, this fine afternoon, a little way into the country.\'  As \nthey, too, thought it would be very pleasant to have a canter in \nthe sunshine, they all rode out of the town together in a gay \nlittle troop.  When they came to a fine level piece of turf, the \nPrince fell to comparing their horses one with another, and \noffering bets that one was faster than another; and the attendants, \nsuspecting no harm, rode galloping matches until their horses were \nquite tired.  The Prince rode no matches himself, but looked on \nfrom his saddle, and staked his money.  Thus they passed the whole \nmerry afternoon.  Now, the sun was setting, and they were all going \nslowly up a hill, the Prince\'s horse very fresh and all the other \nhorses very weary, when a strange rider mounted on a grey steed \nappeared at the top of the hill, and waved his hat.  \'What does the \nfellow mean?\' said the attendants one to another.  The Prince \nanswered on the instant by setting spurs to his horse, dashing away \nat his utmost speed, joining the man, riding into the midst of a \nlittle crowd of horsemen who were then seen waiting under some \ntrees, and who closed around him; and so he departed in a cloud of \ndust, leaving the road empty of all but the baffled attendants, who \nsat looking at one another, while their horses drooped their ears \nand panted.\n\nThe Prince joined the Earl of Gloucester at Ludlow.  The Earl of \nLeicester, with a part of the army and the stupid old King, was at \nHereford.  One of the Earl of Leicester\'s sons, Simon de Montfort, \nwith another part of the army, was in Sussex.  To prevent these two \nparts from uniting was the Prince\'s first object.  He attacked \nSimon de Montfort by night, defeated him, seized his banners and \ntreasure, and forced him into Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire, \nwhich belonged to his family.\n\nHis father, the Earl of Leicester, in the meanwhile, not knowing \nwhat had happened, marched out of Hereford, with his part of the \narmy and the King, to meet him.  He came, on a bright morning in \nAugust, to Evesham, which is watered by the pleasant river Avon.  \nLooking rather anxiously across the prospect towards Kenilworth, he \nsaw his own banners advancing; and his face brightened with joy.  \nBut, it clouded darkly when he presently perceived that the banners \nwere captured, and in the enemy\'s hands; and he said, \'It is over.  \nThe Lord have mercy on our souls, for our bodies are Prince \nEdward\'s!\'\n\nHe fought like a true Knight, nevertheless.  When his horse was \nkilled under him, he fought on foot.  It was a fierce battle, and \nthe dead lay in heaps everywhere.  The old King, stuck up in a suit \nof armour on a big war-horse, which didn\'t mind him at all, and \nwhich carried him into all sorts of places where he didn\'t want to \ngo, got into everybody\'s way, and very nearly got knocked on the \nhead by one of his son\'s men.  But he managed to pipe out, \'I am \nHarry of Winchester!\' and the Prince, who heard him, seized his \nbridle, and took him out of peril.  The Earl of Leicester still \nfought bravely, until his best son Henry was killed, and the bodies \nof his best friends choked his path; and then he fell, still \nfighting, sword in hand.  They mangled his body, and sent it as a \npresent to a noble lady - but a very unpleasant lady, I should \nthink - who was the wife of his worst enemy.  They could not mangle \nhis memory in the minds of the faithful people, though.  Many years \nafterwards, they loved him more than ever, and regarded him as a \nSaint, and always spoke of him as \'Sir Simon the Righteous.\'\n\nAnd even though he was dead, the cause for which he had fought \nstill lived, and was strong, and forced itself upon the King in the \nvery hour of victory.  Henry found himself obliged to respect the \nGreat Charter, however much he hated it, and to make laws similar \nto the laws of the Great Earl of Leicester, and to be moderate and \nforgiving towards the people at last - even towards the people of \nLondon, who had so long opposed him.  There were more risings \nbefore all this was done, but they were set at rest by these means, \nand Prince Edward did his best in all things to restore peace.  One \nSir Adam de Gourdon was the last dissatisfied knight in arms; but, \nthe Prince vanquished him in single combat, in a wood, and nobly \ngave him his life, and became his friend, instead of slaying him.  \nSir Adam was not ungrateful.  He ever afterwards remained devoted \nto his generous conqueror.\n\nWhen the troubles of the Kingdom were thus calmed, Prince Edward \nand his cousin Henry took the Cross, and went away to the Holy \nLand, with many English Lords and Knights.  Four years afterwards \nthe King of the Romans died, and, next year (one thousand two \nhundred and seventy-two), his brother the weak King of England \ndied.  He was sixty-eight years old then, and had reigned fifty-six \nyears.  He was as much of a King in death, as he had ever been in \nlife.  He was the mere pale shadow of a King at all times.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIRST, CALLED LONGSHANKS\n\n\n\nIT was now the year of our Lord one thousand two hundred and \nseventy-two; and Prince Edward, the heir to the throne, being away \nin the Holy Land, knew nothing of his father\'s death.  The Barons, \nhowever, proclaimed him King, immediately after the Royal funeral; \nand the people very willingly consented, since most men knew too \nwell by this time what the horrors of a contest for the crown were.  \nSo King Edward the First, called, in a not very complimentary \nmanner, LONGSHANKS, because of the slenderness of his legs, was \npeacefully accepted by the English Nation.\n\nHis legs had need to be strong, however long and thin they were; \nfor they had to support him through many difficulties on the fiery \nsands of Asia, where his small force of soldiers fainted, died, \ndeserted, and seemed to melt away.  But his prowess made light of \nit, and he said, \'I will go on, if I go on with no other follower \nthan my groom!\'\n\nA Prince of this spirit gave the Turks a deal of trouble.  He \nstormed Nazareth, at which place, of all places on earth, I am \nsorry to relate, he made a frightful slaughter of innocent people; \nand then he went to Acre, where he got a truce of ten years from \nthe Sultan.  He had very nearly lost his life in Acre, through the \ntreachery of a Saracen Noble, called the Emir of Jaffa, who, making \nthe pretence that he had some idea of turning Christian and wanted \nto know all about that religion, sent a trusty messenger to Edward \nvery often - with a dagger in his sleeve.  At last, one Friday in \nWhitsun week, when it was very hot, and all the sandy prospect lay \nbeneath the blazing sun, burnt up like a great overdone biscuit, \nand Edward was lying on a couch, dressed for coolness in only a \nloose robe, the messenger, with his chocolate-coloured face and his \nbright dark eyes and white teeth, came creeping in with a letter, \nand kneeled down like a tame tiger.  But, the moment Edward \nstretched out his hand to take the letter, the tiger made a spring \nat his heart.  He was quick, but Edward was quick too.  He seized \nthe traitor by his chocolate throat, threw him to the ground, and \nslew him with the very dagger he had drawn.  The weapon had struck \nEdward in the arm, and although the wound itself was slight, it \nthreatened to be mortal, for the blade of the dagger had been \nsmeared with poison.  Thanks, however, to a better surgeon than was \noften to be found in those times, and to some wholesome herbs, and \nabove all, to his faithful wife, ELEANOR, who devotedly nursed him, \nand is said by some to have sucked the poison from the wound with \nher own red lips (which I am very willing to believe), Edward soon \nrecovered and was sound again.\n\nAs the King his father had sent entreaties to him to return home, \nhe now began the journey.  He had got as far as Italy, when he met \nmessengers who brought him intelligence of the King\'s death.  \nHearing that all was quiet at home, he made no haste to return to \nhis own dominions, but paid a visit to the Pope, and went in state \nthrough various Italian Towns, where he was welcomed with \nacclamations as a mighty champion of the Cross from the Holy Land, \nand where he received presents of purple mantles and prancing \nhorses, and went along in great triumph.  The shouting people \nlittle knew that he was the last English monarch who would ever \nembark in a crusade, or that within twenty years every conquest \nwhich the Christians had made in the Holy Land at the cost of so \nmuch blood, would be won back by the Turks.  But all this came to \npass.\n\nThere was, and there is, an old town standing in a plain in France, \ncalled ChÉlons.  When the King was coming towards this place on his \nway to England, a wily French Lord, called the Count of ChÉlons, \nsent him a polite challenge to come with his knights and hold a \nfair tournament with the Count and HIS knights, and make a day of \nit with sword and lance.  It was represented to the King that the \nCount of ChÉlons was not to be trusted, and that, instead of a \nholiday fight for mere show and in good humour, he secretly meant a \nreal battle, in which the English should be defeated by superior \nforce.\n\nThe King, however, nothing afraid, went to the appointed place on \nthe appointed day with a thousand followers.  When the Count came \nwith two thousand and attacked the English in earnest, the English \nrushed at them with such valour that the Count\'s men and the \nCount\'s horses soon began to be tumbled down all over the field.  \nThe Count himself seized the King round the neck, but the King \ntumbled HIM out of his saddle in return for the compliment, and, \njumping from his own horse, and standing over him, beat away at his \niron armour like a blacksmith hammering on his anvil.  Even when \nthe Count owned himself defeated and offered his sword, the King \nwould not do him the honour to take it, but made him yield it up to \na common soldier.  There had been such fury shown in this fight, \nthat it was afterwards called the little Battle of ChÉlons.\n\nThe English were very well disposed to be proud of their King after \nthese adventures; so, when he landed at Dover in the year one \nthousand two hundred and seventy-four (being then thirty-six years \nold), and went on to Westminster where he and his good Queen were \ncrowned with great magnificence, splendid rejoicings took place.  \nFor the coronation-feast there were provided, among other eatables, \nfour hundred oxen, four hundred sheep, four hundred and fifty pigs, \neighteen wild boars, three hundred flitches of bacon, and twenty \nthousand fowls.  The fountains and conduits in the street flowed \nwith red and white wine instead of water; the rich citizens hung \nsilks and cloths of the brightest colours out of their windows to \nincrease the beauty of the show, and threw out gold and silver by \nwhole handfuls to make scrambles for the crowd.  In short, there \nwas such eating and drinking, such music and capering, such a \nringing of bells and tossing of caps, such a shouting, and singing, \nand revelling, as the narrow overhanging streets of old London City \nhad not witnessed for many a long day.  All the people were merry \nexcept the poor Jews, who, trembling within their houses, and \nscarcely daring to peep out, began to foresee that they would have \nto find the money for this joviality sooner or later.\n\nTo dismiss this sad subject of the Jews for the present, I am sorry \nto add that in this reign they were most unmercifully pillaged.  \nThey were hanged in great numbers, on accusations of having clipped \nthe King\'s coin - which all kinds of people had done.  They were \nheavily taxed; they were disgracefully badged; they were, on one \nday, thirteen years after the coronation, taken up with their wives \nand children and thrown into beastly prisons, until they purchased \ntheir release by paying to the King twelve thousand pounds.  \nFinally, every kind of property belonging to them was seized by the \nKing, except so little as would defray the charge of their taking \nthemselves away into foreign countries.  Many years elapsed before \nthe hope of gain induced any of their race to return to England, \nwhere they had been treated so heartlessly and had suffered so \nmuch.\n\nIf King Edward the First had been as bad a king to Christians as he \nwas to Jews, he would have been bad indeed.  But he was, in \ngeneral, a wise and great monarch, under whom the country much \nimproved.  He had no love for the Great Charter - few Kings had, \nthrough many, many years - but he had high qualities.  The first \nbold object which he conceived when he came home, was, to unite \nunder one Sovereign England, Scotland, and Wales; the two last of \nwhich countries had each a little king of its own, about whom the \npeople were always quarrelling and fighting, and making a \nprodigious disturbance - a great deal more than he was worth.  In \nthe course of King Edward\'s reign he was engaged, besides, in a war \nwith France.  To make these quarrels clearer, we will separate \ntheir histories and take them thus.  Wales, first.  France, second.  \nScotland, third.\n\n\nLLEWELLYN was the Prince of Wales.  He had been on the side of the \nBarons in the reign of the stupid old King, but had afterwards \nsworn allegiance to him.  When King Edward came to the throne, \nLlewellyn was required to swear allegiance to him also; which he \nrefused to do.  The King, being crowned and in his own dominions, \nthree times more required Llewellyn to come and do homage; and \nthree times more Llewellyn said he would rather not.  He was going \nto be married to ELEANOR DE MONTFORT, a young lady of the family \nmentioned in the last reign; and it chanced that this young lady, \ncoming from France with her youngest brother, EMERIC, was taken by \nan English ship, and was ordered by the English King to be \ndetained.  Upon this, the quarrel came to a head.  The King went, \nwith his fleet, to the coast of Wales, where, so encompassing \nLlewellyn, that he could only take refuge in the bleak mountain \nregion of Snowdon in which no provisions could reach him, he was \nsoon starved into an apology, and into a treaty of peace, and into \npaying the expenses of the war.  The King, however, forgave him \nsome of the hardest conditions of the treaty, and consented to his \nmarriage.  And he now thought he had reduced Wales to obedience.\n\nBut the Welsh, although they were naturally a gentle, quiet, \npleasant people, who liked to receive strangers in their cottages \namong the mountains, and to set before them with free hospitality \nwhatever they had to eat and drink, and to play to them on their \nharps, and sing their native ballads to them, were a people of \ngreat spirit when their blood was up.  Englishmen, after this \naffair, began to be insolent in Wales, and to assume the air of \nmasters; and the Welsh pride could not bear it.  Moreover, they \nbelieved in that unlucky old Merlin, some of whose unlucky old \nprophecies somebody always seemed doomed to remember when there was \na chance of its doing harm; and just at this time some blind old \ngentleman with a harp and a long white beard, who was an excellent \nperson, but had become of an unknown age and tedious, burst out \nwith a declaration that Merlin had predicted that when English \nmoney had become round, a Prince of Wales would be crowned in \nLondon.  Now, King Edward had recently forbidden the English penny \nto be cut into halves and quarters for halfpence and farthings, and \nhad actually introduced a round coin; therefore, the Welsh people \nsaid this was the time Merlin meant, and rose accordingly.\n\nKing Edward had bought over PRINCE DAVID, Llewellyn\'s brother, by \nheaping favours upon him; but he was the first to revolt, being \nperhaps troubled in his conscience.  One stormy night, he surprised \nthe Castle of Hawarden, in possession of which an English nobleman \nhad been left; killed the whole garrison, and carried off the \nnobleman a prisoner to Snowdon.  Upon this, the Welsh people rose \nlike one man.  King Edward, with his army, marching from Worcester \nto the Menai Strait, crossed it - near to where the wonderful \ntubular iron bridge now, in days so different, makes a passage for \nrailway trains - by a bridge of boats that enabled forty men to \nmarch abreast.  He subdued the Island of Anglesea, and sent his men \nforward to observe the enemy.  The sudden appearance of the Welsh \ncreated a panic among them, and they fell back to the bridge.  The \ntide had in the meantime risen and separated the boats; the Welsh \npursuing them, they were driven into the sea, and there they sunk, \nin their heavy iron armour, by thousands.  After this victory \nLlewellyn, helped by the severe winter-weather of Wales, gained \nanother battle; but the King ordering a portion of his English army \nto advance through South Wales, and catch him between two foes, and \nLlewellyn bravely turning to meet this new enemy, he was surprised \nand killed - very meanly, for he was unarmed and defenceless.  His \nhead was struck off and sent to London, where it was fixed upon the \nTower, encircled with a wreath, some say of ivy, some say of \nwillow, some say of silver, to make it look like a ghastly coin in \nridicule of the prediction.\n\nDavid, however, still held out for six months, though eagerly \nsought after by the King, and hunted by his own countrymen.  One of \nthem finally betrayed him with his wife and children.  He was \nsentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered; and from that time \nthis became the established punishment of Traitors in England - a \npunishment wholly without excuse, as being revolting, vile, and \ncruel, after its object is dead; and which has no sense in it, as \nits only real degradation (and that nothing can blot out) is to the \ncountry that permits on any consideration such abominable \nbarbarity.\n\nWales was now subdued.  The Queen giving birth to a young prince in \nthe Castle of Carnarvon, the King showed him to the Welsh people as \ntheir countryman, and called him Prince of Wales; a title that has \never since been borne by the heir-apparent to the English throne - \nwhich that little Prince soon became, by the death of his elder \nbrother.  The King did better things for the Welsh than that, by \nimproving their laws and encouraging their trade.  Disturbances \nstill took place, chiefly occasioned by the avarice and pride of \nthe English Lords, on whom Welsh lands and castles had been \nbestowed; but they were subdued, and the country never rose again.  \nThere is a legend that to prevent the people from being incited to \nrebellion by the songs of their bards and harpers, Edward had them \nall put to death.  Some of them may have fallen among other men who \nheld out against the King; but this general slaughter is, I think, \na fancy of the harpers themselves, who, I dare say, made a song \nabout it many years afterwards, and sang it by the Welsh firesides \nuntil it came to be believed.\n\nThe foreign war of the reign of Edward the First arose in this way.  \nThe crews of two vessels, one a Norman ship, and the other an \nEnglish ship, happened to go to the same place in their boats to \nfill their casks with fresh water.  Being rough angry fellows, they \nbegan to quarrel, and then to fight - the English with their fists; \nthe Normans with their knives - and, in the fight, a Norman was \nkilled.  The Norman crew, instead of revenging themselves upon \nthose English sailors with whom they had quarrelled (who were too \nstrong for them, I suspect), took to their ship again in a great \nrage, attacked the first English ship they met, laid hold of an \nunoffending merchant who happened to be on board, and brutally \nhanged him in the rigging of their own vessel with a dog at his \nfeet.  This so enraged the English sailors that there was no \nrestraining them; and whenever, and wherever, English sailors met \nNorman sailors, they fell upon each other tooth and nail.  The \nIrish and Dutch sailors took part with the English; the French and \nGenoese sailors helped the Normans; and thus the greater part of \nthe mariners sailing over the sea became, in their way, as violent \nand raging as the sea itself when it is disturbed.\n\nKing Edward\'s fame had been so high abroad that he had been chosen \nto decide a difference between France and another foreign power, \nand had lived upon the Continent three years.  At first, neither he \nnor the French King PHILIP (the good Louis had been dead some time) \ninterfered in these quarrels; but when a fleet of eighty English \nships engaged and utterly defeated a Norman fleet of two hundred, \nin a pitched battle fought round a ship at anchor, in which no \nquarter was given, the matter became too serious to be passed over.  \nKing Edward, as Duke of Guienne, was summoned to present himself \nbefore the King of France, at Paris, and answer for the damage done \nby his sailor subjects.  At first, he sent the Bishop of London as \nhis representative, and then his brother EDMUND, who was married to \nthe French Queen\'s mother.  I am afraid Edmund was an easy man, and \nallowed himself to be talked over by his charming relations, the \nFrench court ladies; at all events, he was induced to give up his \nbrother\'s dukedom for forty days - as a mere form, the French King \nsaid, to satisfy his honour - and he was so very much astonished, \nwhen the time was out, to find that the French King had no idea of \ngiving it up again, that I should not wonder if it hastened his \ndeath:  which soon took place.\n\nKing Edward was a King to win his foreign dukedom back again, if it \ncould be won by energy and valour.  He raised a large army, \nrenounced his allegiance as Duke of Guienne, and crossed the sea to \ncarry war into France.  Before any important battle was fought, \nhowever, a truce was agreed upon for two years; and in the course \nof that time, the Pope effected a reconciliation.  King Edward, who \nwas now a widower, having lost his affectionate and good wife, \nEleanor, married the French King\'s sister, MARGARET; and the Prince \nof Wales was contracted to the French King\'s daughter ISABELLA.\n\nOut of bad things, good things sometimes arise.  Out of this \nhanging of the innocent merchant, and the bloodshed and strife it \ncaused, there came to be established one of the greatest powers \nthat the English people now possess.  The preparations for the war \nbeing very expensive, and King Edward greatly wanting money, and \nbeing very arbitrary in his ways of raising it, some of the Barons \nbegan firmly to oppose him.  Two of them, in particular, HUMPHREY \nBOHUN, Earl of Hereford, and ROGER BIGOD, Earl of Norfolk, were so \nstout against him, that they maintained he had no right to command \nthem to head his forces in Guienne, and flatly refused to go there.  \n\'By Heaven, Sir Earl,\' said the King to the Earl of Hereford, in a \ngreat passion, \'you shall either go or be hanged!\'  \'By Heaven, Sir \nKing,\' replied the Earl, \'I will neither go nor yet will I be \nhanged!\' and both he and the other Earl sturdily left the court, \nattended by many Lords.  The King tried every means of raising \nmoney.  He taxed the clergy, in spite of all the Pope said to the \ncontrary; and when they refused to pay, reduced them to submission, \nby saying Very well, then they had no claim upon the government for \nprotection, and any man might plunder them who would - which a good \nmany men were very ready to do, and very readily did, and which the \nclergy found too losing a game to be played at long.  He seized all \nthe wool and leather in the hands of the merchants, promising to \npay for it some fine day; and he set a tax upon the exportation of \nwool, which was so unpopular among the traders that it was called \n\'The evil toll.\'  But all would not do.  The Barons, led by those \ntwo great Earls, declared any taxes imposed without the consent of \nParliament, unlawful; and the Parliament refused to impose taxes, \nuntil the King should confirm afresh the two Great Charters, and \nshould solemnly declare in writing, that there was no power in the \ncountry to raise money from the people, evermore, but the power of \nParliament representing all ranks of the people.  The King was very \nunwilling to diminish his own power by allowing this great \nprivilege in the Parliament; but there was no help for it, and he \nat last complied.  We shall come to another King by-and-by, who \nmight have saved his head from rolling off, if he had profited by \nthis example.\n\nThe people gained other benefits in Parliament from the good sense \nand wisdom of this King.  Many of the laws were much improved; \nprovision was made for the greater safety of travellers, and the \napprehension of thieves and murderers; the priests were prevented \nfrom holding too much land, and so becoming too powerful; and \nJustices of the Peace were first appointed (though not at first \nunder that name) in various parts of the country.\n\n\nAnd now we come to Scotland, which was the great and lasting \ntrouble of the reign of King Edward the First.\n\nAbout thirteen years after King Edward\'s coronation, Alexander the \nThird, the King of Scotland, died of a fall from his horse.  He had \nbeen married to Margaret, King Edward\'s sister.  All their children \nbeing dead, the Scottish crown became the right of a young Princess \nonly eight years old, the daughter of ERIC, King of Norway, who had \nmarried a daughter of the deceased sovereign.  King Edward \nproposed, that the Maiden of Norway, as this Princess was called, \nshould be engaged to be married to his eldest son; but, \nunfortunately, as she was coming over to England she fell sick, and \nlanding on one of the Orkney Islands, died there.  A great \ncommotion immediately began in Scotland, where as many as thirteen \nnoisy claimants to the vacant throne started up and made a general \nconfusion.\n\nKing Edward being much renowned for his sagacity and justice, it \nseems to have been agreed to refer the dispute to him.  He accepted \nthe trust, and went, with an army, to the Border-land where England \nand Scotland joined.  There, he called upon the Scottish gentlemen \nto meet him at the Castle of Norham, on the English side of the \nriver Tweed; and to that Castle they came.  But, before he would \ntake any step in the business, he required those Scottish \ngentlemen, one and all, to do homage to him as their superior Lord; \nand when they hesitated, he said, \'By holy Edward, whose crown I \nwear, I will have my rights, or I will die in maintaining them!\'  \nThe Scottish gentlemen, who had not expected this, were \ndisconcerted, and asked for three weeks to think about it.\n\nAt the end of the three weeks, another meeting took place, on a \ngreen plain on the Scottish side of the river.  Of all the \ncompetitors for the Scottish throne, there were only two who had \nany real claim, in right of their near kindred to the Royal Family.  \nThese were JOHN BALIOL and ROBERT BRUCE:  and the right was, I have \nno doubt, on the side of John Baliol.  At this particular meeting \nJohn Baliol was not present, but Robert Bruce was; and on Robert \nBruce being formally asked whether he acknowledged the King of \nEngland for his superior lord, he answered, plainly and distinctly, \nYes, he did.  Next day, John Baliol appeared, and said the same.  \nThis point settled, some arrangements were made for inquiring into \ntheir titles.\n\nThe inquiry occupied a pretty long time - more than a year.  While \nit was going on, King Edward took the opportunity of making a \njourney through Scotland, and calling upon the Scottish people of \nall degrees to acknowledge themselves his vassals, or be imprisoned \nuntil they did.  In the meanwhile, Commissioners were appointed to \nconduct the inquiry, a Parliament was held at Berwick about it, the \ntwo claimants were heard at full length, and there was a vast \namount of talking.  At last, in the great hall of the Castle of \nBerwick, the King gave judgment in favour of John Baliol:  who, \nconsenting to receive his crown by the King of England\'s favour and \npermission, was crowned at Scone, in an old stone chair which had \nbeen used for ages in the abbey there, at the coronations of \nScottish Kings.  Then, King Edward caused the great seal of \nScotland, used since the late King\'s death, to be broken in four \npieces, and placed in the English Treasury; and considered that he \nnow had Scotland (according to the common saying) under his thumb.\n\nScotland had a strong will of its own yet, however.  King Edward, \ndetermined that the Scottish King should not forget he was his \nvassal, summoned him repeatedly to come and defend himself and his \njudges before the English Parliament when appeals from the \ndecisions of Scottish courts of justice were being heard.  At \nlength, John Baliol, who had no great heart of his own, had so much \nheart put into him by the brave spirit of the Scottish people, who \ntook this as a national insult, that he refused to come any more.  \nThereupon, the King further required him to help him in his war \nabroad (which was then in progress), and to give up, as security \nfor his good behaviour in future, the three strong Scottish Castles \nof Jedburgh, Roxburgh, and Berwick.  Nothing of this being done; on \nthe contrary, the Scottish people concealing their King among their \nmountains in the Highlands and showing a determination to resist; \nEdward marched to Berwick with an army of thirty thousand foot, and \nfour thousand horse; took the Castle, and slew its whole garrison, \nand the inhabitants of the town as well - men, women, and children.  \nLORD WARRENNE, Earl of Surrey, then went on to the Castle of \nDunbar, before which a battle was fought, and the whole Scottish \narmy defeated with great slaughter.  The victory being complete, \nthe Earl of Surrey was left as guardian of Scotland; the principal \noffices in that kingdom were given to Englishmen; the more powerful \nScottish Nobles were obliged to come and live in England; the \nScottish crown and sceptre were brought away; and even the old \nstone chair was carried off and placed in Westminster Abbey, where \nyou may see it now.  Baliol had the Tower of London lent him for a \nresidence, with permission to range about within a circle of twenty \nmiles.  Three years afterwards he was allowed to go to Normandy, \nwhere he had estates, and where he passed the remaining six years \nof his life:  far more happily, I dare say, than he had lived for a \nlong while in angry Scotland.\n\nNow, there was, in the West of Scotland, a gentleman of small \nfortune, named WILLIAM WALLACE, the second son of a Scottish \nknight.  He was a man of great size and great strength; he was very \nbrave and daring; when he spoke to a body of his countrymen, he \ncould rouse them in a wonderful manner by the power of his burning \nwords; he loved Scotland dearly, and he hated England with his \nutmost might.  The domineering conduct of the English who now held \nthe places of trust in Scotland made them as intolerable to the \nproud Scottish people as they had been, under similar \ncircumstances, to the Welsh; and no man in all Scotland regarded \nthem with so much smothered rage as William Wallace.  One day, an \nEnglishman in office, little knowing what he was, affronted HIM.  \nWallace instantly struck him dead, and taking refuge among the \nrocks and hills, and there joining with his countryman, SIR WILLIAM \nDOUGLAS, who was also in arms against King Edward, became the most \nresolute and undaunted champion of a people struggling for their \nindependence that ever lived upon the earth.\n\nThe English Guardian of the Kingdom fled before him, and, thus \nencouraged, the Scottish people revolted everywhere, and fell upon \nthe English without mercy.  The Earl of Surrey, by the King\'s \ncommands, raised all the power of the Border-counties, and two \nEnglish armies poured into Scotland.  Only one Chief, in the face \nof those armies, stood by Wallace, who, with a force of forty \nthousand men, awaited the invaders at a place on the river Forth, \nwithin two miles of Stirling.  Across the river there was only one \npoor wooden bridge, called the bridge of Kildean - so narrow, that \nbut two men could cross it abreast.  With his eyes upon this \nbridge, Wallace posted the greater part of his men among some \nrising grounds, and waited calmly.  When the English army came up \non the opposite bank of the river, messengers were sent forward to \noffer terms.  Wallace sent them back with a defiance, in the name \nof the freedom of Scotland.  Some of the officers of the Earl of \nSurrey in command of the English, with THEIR eyes also on the \nbridge, advised him to be discreet and not hasty.  He, however, \nurged to immediate battle by some other officers, and particularly \nby CRESSINGHAM, King Edward\'s treasurer, and a rash man, gave the \nword of command to advance.  One thousand English crossed the \nbridge, two abreast; the Scottish troops were as motionless as \nstone images.  Two thousand English crossed; three thousand, four \nthousand, five.  Not a feather, all this time, had been seen to \nstir among the Scottish bonnets.  Now, they all fluttered.  \n\'Forward, one party, to the foot of the Bridge!\' cried Wallace, \n\'and let no more English cross!  The rest, down with me on the five \nthousand who have come over, and cut them all to pieces!\'  It was \ndone, in the sight of the whole remainder of the English army, who \ncould give no help.  Cressingham himself was killed, and the Scotch \nmade whips for their horses of his skin.\n\nKing Edward was abroad at this time, and during the successes on \nthe Scottish side which followed, and which enabled bold Wallace to \nwin the whole country back again, and even to ravage the English \nborders.  But, after a few winter months, the King returned, and \ntook the field with more than his usual energy.  One night, when a \nkick from his horse as they both lay on the ground together broke \ntwo of his ribs, and a cry arose that he was killed, he leaped into \nhis saddle, regardless of the pain he suffered, and rode through \nthe camp.  Day then appearing, he gave the word (still, of course, \nin that bruised and aching state) Forward! and led his army on to \nnear Falkirk, where the Scottish forces were seen drawn up on some \nstony ground, behind a morass.  Here, he defeated Wallace, and \nkilled fifteen thousand of his men.  With the shattered remainder, \nWallace drew back to Stirling; but, being pursued, set fire to the \ntown that it might give no help to the English, and escaped.  The \ninhabitants of Perth afterwards set fire to their houses for the \nsame reason, and the King, unable to find provisions, was forced to \nwithdraw his army.\n\nAnother ROBERT BRUCE, the grandson of him who had disputed the \nScottish crown with Baliol, was now in arms against the King (that \nelder Bruce being dead), and also JOHN COMYN, Baliol\'s nephew.  \nThese two young men might agree in opposing Edward, but could agree \nin nothing else, as they were rivals for the throne of Scotland.  \nProbably it was because they knew this, and knew what troubles must \narise even if they could hope to get the better of the great \nEnglish King, that the principal Scottish people applied to the \nPope for his interference.  The Pope, on the principle of losing \nnothing for want of trying to get it, very coolly claimed that \nScotland belonged to him; but this was a little too much, and the \nParliament in a friendly manner told him so.\n\nIn the spring time of the year one thousand three hundred and \nthree, the King sent SIR JOHN SEGRAVE, whom he made Governor of \nScotland, with twenty thousand men, to reduce the rebels.  Sir John \nwas not as careful as he should have been, but encamped at Rosslyn, \nnear Edinburgh, with his army divided into three parts.  The \nScottish forces saw their advantage; fell on each part separately; \ndefeated each; and killed all the prisoners.  Then, came the King \nhimself once more, as soon as a great army could be raised; he \npassed through the whole north of Scotland, laying waste whatsoever \ncame in his way; and he took up his winter quarters at Dunfermline.  \nThe Scottish cause now looked so hopeless, that Comyn and the other \nnobles made submission and received their pardons.  Wallace alone \nstood out.  He was invited to surrender, though on no distinct \npledge that his life should be spared; but he still defied the \nireful King, and lived among the steep crags of the Highland glens, \nwhere the eagles made their nests, and where the mountain torrents \nroared, and the white snow was deep, and the bitter winds blew \nround his unsheltered head, as he lay through many a pitch-dark \nnight wrapped up in his plaid.  Nothing could break his spirit; \nnothing could lower his courage; nothing could induce him to forget \nor to forgive his country\'s wrongs.  Even when the Castle of \nStirling, which had long held out, was besieged by the King with \nevery kind of military engine then in use; even when the lead upon \ncathedral roofs was taken down to help to make them; even when the \nKing, though an old man, commanded in the siege as if he were a \nyouth, being so resolved to conquer; even when the brave garrison \n(then found with amazement to be not two hundred people, including \nseveral ladies) were starved and beaten out and were made to submit \non their knees, and with every form of disgrace that could \naggravate their sufferings; even then, when there was not a ray of \nhope in Scotland, William Wallace was as proud and firm as if he \nhad beheld the powerful and relentless Edward lying dead at his \nfeet.\n\nWho betrayed William Wallace in the end, is not quite certain.  \nThat he was betrayed - probably by an attendant - is too true.  He \nwas taken to the Castle of Dumbarton, under SIR JOHN MENTEITH, and \nthence to London, where the great fame of his bravery and \nresolution attracted immense concourses of people to behold him.  \nHe was tried in Westminster Hall, with a crown of laurel on his \nhead - it is supposed because he was reported to have said that he \nought to wear, or that he would wear, a crown there and was found \nguilty as a robber, a murderer, and a traitor.  What they called a \nrobber (he said to those who tried him) he was, because he had \ntaken spoil from the King\'s men.  What they called a murderer, he \nwas, because he had slain an insolent Englishman.  What they called \na traitor, he was not, for he had never sworn allegiance to the \nKing, and had ever scorned to do it.  He was dragged at the tails \nof horses to West Smithfield, and there hanged on a high gallows, \ntorn open before he was dead, beheaded, and quartered.  His head \nwas set upon a pole on London Bridge, his right arm was sent to \nNewcastle, his left arm to Berwick, his legs to Perth and Aberdeen.  \nBut, if King Edward had had his body cut into inches, and had sent \nevery separate inch into a separate town, he could not have \ndispersed it half so far and wide as his fame.  Wallace will be \nremembered in songs and stories, while there are songs and stories \nin the English tongue, and Scotland will hold him dear while her \nlakes and mountains last.\n\nReleased from this dreaded enemy, the King made a fairer plan of \nGovernment for Scotland, divided the offices of honour among \nScottish gentlemen and English gentlemen, forgave past offences, \nand thought, in his old age, that his work was done.\n\nBut he deceived himself.  Comyn and Bruce conspired, and made an \nappointment to meet at Dumfries, in the church of the Minorites.  \nThere is a story that Comyn was false to Bruce, and had informed \nagainst him to the King; that Bruce was warned of his danger and \nthe necessity of flight, by receiving, one night as he sat at \nsupper, from his friend the Earl of Gloucester, twelve pennies and \na pair of spurs; that as he was riding angrily to keep his \nappointment (through a snow-storm, with his horse\'s shoes reversed \nthat he might not be tracked), he met an evil-looking serving man, \na messenger of Comyn, whom he killed, and concealed in whose dress \nhe found letters that proved Comyn\'s treachery.  However this may \nbe, they were likely enough to quarrel in any case, being hot-\nheaded rivals; and, whatever they quarrelled about, they certainly \ndid quarrel in the church where they met, and Bruce drew his dagger \nand stabbed Comyn, who fell upon the pavement.  When Bruce came \nout, pale and disturbed, the friends who were waiting for him asked \nwhat was the matter?  \'I think I have killed Comyn,\' said he.  \'You \nonly think so?\' returned one of them; \'I will make sure!\' and going \ninto the church, and finding him alive, stabbed him again and \nagain.  Knowing that the King would never forgive this new deed of \nviolence, the party then declared Bruce King of Scotland:  got him \ncrowned at Scone - without the chair; and set up the rebellious \nstandard once again.\n\nWhen the King heard of it he kindled with fiercer anger than he had \never shown yet.  He caused the Prince of Wales and two hundred and \nseventy of the young nobility to be knighted - the trees in the \nTemple Gardens were cut down to make room for their tents, and they \nwatched their armour all night, according to the old usage:  some \nin the Temple Church:  some in Westminster Abbey - and at the \npublic Feast which then took place, he swore, by Heaven, and by two \nswans covered with gold network which his minstrels placed upon the \ntable, that he would avenge the death of Comyn, and would punish \nthe false Bruce.  And before all the company, he charged the Prince \nhis son, in case that he should die before accomplishing his vow, \nnot to bury him until it was fulfilled.  Next morning the Prince \nand the rest of the young Knights rode away to the Border-country \nto join the English army; and the King, now weak and sick, followed \nin a horse-litter.\n\nBruce, after losing a battle and undergoing many dangers and much \nmisery, fled to Ireland, where he lay concealed through the winter.  \nThat winter, Edward passed in hunting down and executing Bruce\'s \nrelations and adherents, sparing neither youth nor age, and showing \nno touch of pity or sign of mercy.  In the following spring, Bruce \nreappeared and gained some victories.  In these frays, both sides \nwere grievously cruel.  For instance - Bruce\'s two brothers, being \ntaken captives desperately wounded, were ordered by the King to \ninstant execution.  Bruce\'s friend Sir John Douglas, taking his own \nCastle of Douglas out of the hands of an English Lord, roasted the \ndead bodies of the slaughtered garrison in a great fire made of \nevery movable within it; which dreadful cookery his men called the \nDouglas Larder.  Bruce, still successful, however, drove the Earl \nof Pembroke and the Earl of Gloucester into the Castle of Ayr and \nlaid siege to it.\n\nThe King, who had been laid up all the winter, but had directed the \narmy from his sick-bed, now advanced to Carlisle, and there, \ncausing the litter in which he had travelled to be placed in the \nCathedral as an offering to Heaven, mounted his horse once more, \nand for the last time.  He was now sixty-nine years old, and had \nreigned thirty-five years.  He was so ill, that in four days he \ncould go no more than six miles; still, even at that pace, he went \non and resolutely kept his face towards the Border.  At length, he \nlay down at the village of Burgh-upon-Sands; and there, telling \nthose around him to impress upon the Prince that he was to remember \nhis father\'s vow, and was never to rest until he had thoroughly \nsubdued Scotland, he yielded up his last breath.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SECOND\n\n\n\nKING Edward the Second, the first Prince of Wales, was twenty-three \nyears old when his father died.  There was a certain favourite of \nhis, a young man from Gascony, named PIERS GAVESTON, of whom his \nfather had so much disapproved that he had ordered him out of \nEngland, and had made his son swear by the side of his sick-bed, \nnever to bring him back.  But, the Prince no sooner found himself \nKing, than he broke his oath, as so many other Princes and Kings \ndid (they were far too ready to take oaths), and sent for his dear \nfriend immediately.\n\nNow, this same Gaveston was handsome enough, but was a reckless, \ninsolent, audacious fellow.  He was detested by the proud English \nLords:  not only because he had such power over the King, and made \nthe Court such a dissipated place, but, also, because he could ride \nbetter than they at tournaments, and was used, in his impudence, to \ncut very bad jokes on them; calling one, the old hog; another, the \nstage-player; another, the Jew; another, the black dog of Ardenne.  \nThis was as poor wit as need be, but it made those Lords very \nwroth; and the surly Earl of Warwick, who was the black dog, swore \nthat the time should come when Piers Gaveston should feel the black \ndog\'s teeth.\n\nIt was not come yet, however, nor did it seem to be coming.  The \nKing made him Earl of Cornwall, and gave him vast riches; and, when \nthe King went over to France to marry the French Princess, \nISABELLA, daughter of PHILIP LE BEL:  who was said to be the most \nbeautiful woman in the world:  he made Gaveston, Regent of the \nKingdom.  His splendid marriage-ceremony in the Church of Our Lady \nat Boulogne, where there were four Kings and three Queens present \n(quite a pack of Court Cards, for I dare say the Knaves were not \nwanting), being over, he seemed to care little or nothing for his \nbeautiful wife; but was wild with impatience to meet Gaveston \nagain.\n\nWhen he landed at home, he paid no attention to anybody else, but \nran into the favourite\'s arms before a great concourse of people, \nand hugged him, and kissed him, and called him his brother.  At the \ncoronation which soon followed, Gaveston was the richest and \nbrightest of all the glittering company there, and had the honour \nof carrying the crown.  This made the proud Lords fiercer than \never; the people, too, despised the favourite, and would never call \nhim Earl of Cornwall, however much he complained to the King and \nasked him to punish them for not doing so, but persisted in styling \nhim plain Piers Gaveston.\n\nThe Barons were so unceremonious with the King in giving him to \nunderstand that they would not bear this favourite, that the King \nwas obliged to send him out of the country.  The favourite himself \nwas made to take an oath (more oaths!) that he would never come \nback, and the Barons supposed him to be banished in disgrace, until \nthey heard that he was appointed Governor of Ireland.  Even this \nwas not enough for the besotted King, who brought him home again in \na year\'s time, and not only disgusted the Court and the people by \nhis doting folly, but offended his beautiful wife too, who never \nliked him afterwards.\n\nHe had now the old Royal want - of money - and the Barons had the \nnew power of positively refusing to let him raise any.  He summoned \na Parliament at York; the Barons refused to make one, while the \nfavourite was near him.  He summoned another Parliament at \nWestminster, and sent Gaveston away.  Then, the Barons came, \ncompletely armed, and appointed a committee of themselves to \ncorrect abuses in the state and in the King\'s household.  He got \nsome money on these conditions, and directly set off with Gaveston \nto the Border-country, where they spent it in idling away the time, \nand feasting, while Bruce made ready to drive the English out of \nScotland.  For, though the old King had even made this poor weak \nson of his swear (as some say) that he would not bury his bones, \nbut would have them boiled clean in a caldron, and carried before \nthe English army until Scotland was entirely subdued, the second \nEdward was so unlike the first that Bruce gained strength and power \nevery day.\n\nThe committee of Nobles, after some months of deliberation, \nordained that the King should henceforth call a Parliament \ntogether, once every year, and even twice if necessary, instead of \nsummoning it only when he chose.  Further, that Gaveston should \nonce more be banished, and, this time, on pain of death if he ever \ncame back.  The King\'s tears were of no avail; he was obliged to \nsend his favourite to Flanders.  As soon as he had done so, \nhowever, he dissolved the Parliament, with the low cunning of a \nmere fool, and set off to the North of England, thinking to get an \narmy about him to oppose the Nobles.  And once again he brought \nGaveston home, and heaped upon him all the riches and titles of \nwhich the Barons had deprived him.\n\nThe Lords saw, now, that there was nothing for it but to put the \nfavourite to death.  They could have done so, legally, according to \nthe terms of his banishment; but they did so, I am sorry to say, in \na shabby manner.  Led by the Earl of Lancaster, the King\'s cousin, \nthey first of all attacked the King and Gaveston at Newcastle.  \nThey had time to escape by sea, and the mean King, having his \nprecious Gaveston with him, was quite content to leave his lovely \nwife behind.  When they were comparatively safe, they separated; \nthe King went to York to collect a force of soldiers; and the \nfavourite shut himself up, in the meantime, in Scarborough Castle \noverlooking the sea.  This was what the Barons wanted.  They knew \nthat the Castle could not hold out; they attacked it, and made \nGaveston surrender.  He delivered himself up to the Earl of \nPembroke - that Lord whom he had called the Jew - on the Earl\'s \npledging his faith and knightly word, that no harm should happen to \nhim and no violence be done him.\n\nNow, it was agreed with Gaveston that he should be taken to the \nCastle of Wallingford, and there kept in honourable custody.  They \ntravelled as far as Dedington, near Banbury, where, in the Castle \nof that place, they stopped for a night to rest.  Whether the Earl \nof Pembroke left his prisoner there, knowing what would happen, or \nreally left him thinking no harm, and only going (as he pretended) \nto visit his wife, the Countess, who was in the neighbourhood, is \nno great matter now; in any case, he was bound as an honourable \ngentleman to protect his prisoner, and he did not do it.  In the \nmorning, while the favourite was yet in bed, he was required to \ndress himself and come down into the court-yard.  He did so without \nany mistrust, but started and turned pale when he found it full of \nstrange armed men.  \'I think you know me?\' said their leader, also \narmed from head to foot.  \'I am the black dog of Ardenne!\'  The \ntime was come when Piers Gaveston was to feel the black dog\'s teeth \nindeed.  They set him on a mule, and carried him, in mock state and \nwith military music, to the black dog\'s kennel - Warwick Castle - \nwhere a hasty council, composed of some great noblemen, considered \nwhat should be done with him.  Some were for sparing him, but one \nloud voice - it was the black dog\'s bark, I dare say - sounded \nthrough the Castle Hall, uttering these words:  \'You have the fox \nin your power.  Let him go now, and you must hunt him again.\'\n\nThey sentenced him to death.  He threw himself at the feet of the \nEarl of Lancaster - the old hog - but the old hog was as savage as \nthe dog.  He was taken out upon the pleasant road, leading from \nWarwick to Coventry, where the beautiful river Avon, by which, long \nafterwards, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE was born and now lies buried, \nsparkled in the bright landscape of the beautiful May-day; and \nthere they struck off his wretched head, and stained the dust with \nhis blood.\n\nWhen the King heard of this black deed, in his grief and rage he \ndenounced relentless war against his Barons, and both sides were in \narms for half a year.  But, it then became necessary for them to \njoin their forces against Bruce, who had used the time well while \nthey were divided, and had now a great power in Scotland.\n\nIntelligence was brought that Bruce was then besieging Stirling \nCastle, and that the Governor had been obliged to pledge himself to \nsurrender it, unless he should be relieved before a certain day.  \nHereupon, the King ordered the nobles and their fighting-men to \nmeet him at Berwick; but, the nobles cared so little for the King, \nand so neglected the summons, and lost time, that only on the day \nbefore that appointed for the surrender, did the King find himself \nat Stirling, and even then with a smaller force than he had \nexpected.  However, he had, altogether, a hundred thousand men, and \nBruce had not more than forty thousand; but, Bruce\'s army was \nstrongly posted in three square columns, on the ground lying \nbetween the Burn or Brook of Bannock and the walls of Stirling \nCastle.\n\nOn the very evening, when the King came up, Bruce did a brave act \nthat encouraged his men.  He was seen by a certain HENRY DE BOHUN, \nan English Knight, riding about before his army on a little horse, \nwith a light battle-axe in his hand, and a crown of gold on his \nhead.  This English Knight, who was mounted on a strong war-horse, \ncased in steel, strongly armed, and able (as he thought) to \noverthrow Bruce by crushing him with his mere weight, set spurs to \nhis great charger, rode on him, and made a thrust at him with his \nheavy spear.  Bruce parried the thrust, and with one blow of his \nbattle-axe split his skull.\n\nThe Scottish men did not forget this, next day when the battle \nraged.  RANDOLPH, Bruce\'s valiant Nephew, rode, with the small body \nof men he commanded, into such a host of the English, all shining \nin polished armour in the sunlight, that they seemed to be \nswallowed up and lost, as if they had plunged into the sea.  But, \nthey fought so well, and did such dreadful execution, that the \nEnglish staggered.  Then came Bruce himself upon them, with all the \nrest of his army.  While they were thus hard pressed and amazed, \nthere appeared upon the hills what they supposed to be a new \nScottish army, but what were really only the camp followers, in \nnumber fifteen thousand:  whom Bruce had taught to show themselves \nat that place and time.  The Earl of Gloucester, commanding the \nEnglish horse, made a last rush to change the fortune of the day; \nbut Bruce (like Jack the Giant-killer in the story) had had pits \ndug in the ground, and covered over with turfs and stakes.  Into \nthese, as they gave way beneath the weight of the horses, riders \nand horses rolled by hundreds.  The English were completely routed; \nall their treasure, stores, and engines, were taken by the Scottish \nmen; so many waggons and other wheeled vehicles were seized, that \nit is related that they would have reached, if they had been drawn \nout in a line, one hundred and eighty miles.  The fortunes of \nScotland were, for the time, completely changed; and never was a \nbattle won, more famous upon Scottish ground, than this great \nbattle of BANNOCKBURN.\n\nPlague and famine succeeded in England; and still the powerless \nKing and his disdainful Lords were always in contention.  Some of \nthe turbulent chiefs of Ireland made proposals to Bruce, to accept \nthe rule of that country.  He sent his brother Edward to them, who \nwas crowned King of Ireland.  He afterwards went himself to help \nhis brother in his Irish wars, but his brother was defeated in the \nend and killed.  Robert Bruce, returning to Scotland, still \nincreased his strength there.\n\nAs the King\'s ruin had begun in a favourite, so it seemed likely to \nend in one.  He was too poor a creature to rely at all upon \nhimself; and his new favourite was one HUGH LE DESPENSER, the son \nof a gentleman of ancient family.  Hugh was handsome and brave, but \nhe was the favourite of a weak King, whom no man cared a rush for, \nand that was a dangerous place to hold.  The Nobles leagued against \nhim, because the King liked him; and they lay in wait, both for his \nruin and his father\'s.  Now, the King had married him to the \ndaughter of the late Earl of Gloucester, and had given both him and \nhis father great possessions in Wales.  In their endeavours to \nextend these, they gave violent offence to an angry Welsh \ngentleman, named JOHN DE MOWBRAY, and to divers other angry Welsh \ngentlemen, who resorted to arms, took their castles, and seized \ntheir estates.  The Earl of Lancaster had first placed the \nfavourite (who was a poor relation of his own) at Court, and he \nconsidered his own dignity offended by the preference he received \nand the honours he acquired; so he, and the Barons who were his \nfriends, joined the Welshmen, marched on London, and sent a message \nto the King demanding to have the favourite and his father \nbanished.  At first, the King unaccountably took it into his head \nto be spirited, and to send them a bold reply; but when they \nquartered themselves around Holborn and Clerkenwell, and went down, \narmed, to the Parliament at Westminster, he gave way, and complied \nwith their demands.\n\nHis turn of triumph came sooner than he expected.  It arose out of \nan accidental circumstance.  The beautiful Queen happening to be \ntravelling, came one night to one of the royal castles, and \ndemanded to be lodged and entertained there until morning.  The \ngovernor of this castle, who was one of the enraged lords, was \naway, and in his absence, his wife refused admission to the Queen; \na scuffle took place among the common men on either side, and some \nof the royal attendants were killed.  The people, who cared nothing \nfor the King, were very angry that their beautiful Queen should be \nthus rudely treated in her own dominions; and the King, taking \nadvantage of this feeling, besieged the castle, took it, and then \ncalled the two Despensers home.  Upon this, the confederate lords \nand the Welshmen went over to Bruce.  The King encountered them at \nBoroughbridge, gained the victory, and took a number of \ndistinguished prisoners; among them, the Earl of Lancaster, now an \nold man, upon whose destruction he was resolved.  This Earl was \ntaken to his own castle of Pontefract, and there tried and found \nguilty by an unfair court appointed for the purpose; he was not \neven allowed to speak in his own defence.  He was insulted, pelted, \nmounted on a starved pony without saddle or bridle, carried out, \nand beheaded.  Eight-and-twenty knights were hanged, drawn, and \nquartered.  When the King had despatched this bloody work, and had \nmade a fresh and a long truce with Bruce, he took the Despensers \ninto greater favour than ever, and made the father Earl of \nWinchester.\n\nOne prisoner, and an important one, who was taken at Boroughbridge, \nmade his escape, however, and turned the tide against the King.  \nThis was ROGER MORTIMER, always resolutely opposed to him, who was \nsentenced to death, and placed for safe custody in the Tower of \nLondon.  He treated his guards to a quantity of wine into which he \nhad put a sleeping potion; and, when they were insensible, broke \nout of his dungeon, got into a kitchen, climbed up the chimney, let \nhimself down from the roof of the building with a rope-ladder, \npassed the sentries, got down to the river, and made away in a boat \nto where servants and horses were waiting for him.  He finally \nescaped to France, where CHARLES LE BEL, the brother of the \nbeautiful Queen, was King.  Charles sought to quarrel with the King \nof England, on pretence of his not having come to do him homage at \nhis coronation.  It was proposed that the beautiful Queen should go \nover to arrange the dispute; she went, and wrote home to the King, \nthat as he was sick and could not come to France himself, perhaps \nit would be better to send over the young Prince, their son, who \nwas only twelve years old, who could do homage to her brother in \nhis stead, and in whose company she would immediately return.  The \nKing sent him:  but, both he and the Queen remained at the French \nCourt, and Roger Mortimer became the Queen\'s lover.\n\nWhen the King wrote, again and again, to the Queen to come home, \nshe did not reply that she despised him too much to live with him \nany more (which was the truth), but said she was afraid of the two \nDespensers.  In short, her design was to overthrow the favourites\' \npower, and the King\'s power, such as it was, and invade England.  \nHaving obtained a French force of two thousand men, and being \njoined by all the English exiles then in France, she landed, within \na year, at Orewell, in Suffolk, where she was immediately joined by \nthe Earls of Kent and Norfolk, the King\'s two brothers; by other \npowerful noblemen; and lastly, by the first English general who was \ndespatched to check her:  who went over to her with all his men.  \nThe people of London, receiving these tidings, would do nothing for \nthe King, but broke open the Tower, let out all his prisoners, and \nthrew up their caps and hurrahed for the beautiful Queen.\n\nThe King, with his two favourites, fled to Bristol, where he left \nold Despenser in charge of the town and castle, while he went on \nwith the son to Wales.  The Bristol men being opposed to the King, \nand it being impossible to hold the town with enemies everywhere \nwithin the walls, Despenser yielded it up on the third day, and was \ninstantly brought to trial for having traitorously influenced what \nwas called \'the King\'s mind\' - though I doubt if the King ever had \nany.  He was a venerable old man, upwards of ninety years of age, \nbut his age gained no respect or mercy.  He was hanged, torn open \nwhile he was yet alive, cut up into pieces, and thrown to the dogs.  \nHis son was soon taken, tried at Hereford before the same judge on \na long series of foolish charges, found guilty, and hanged upon a \ngallows fifty feet high, with a chaplet of nettles round his head.  \nHis poor old father and he were innocent enough of any worse crimes \nthan the crime of having been friends of a King, on whom, as a mere \nman, they would never have deigned to cast a favourable look.  It \nis a bad crime, I know, and leads to worse; but, many lords and \ngentlemen - I even think some ladies, too, if I recollect right - \nhave committed it in England, who have neither been given to the \ndogs, nor hanged up fifty feet high.\n\nThe wretched King was running here and there, all this time, and \nnever getting anywhere in particular, until he gave himself up, and \nwas taken off to Kenilworth Castle.  When he was safely lodged \nthere, the Queen went to London and met the Parliament.  And the \nBishop of Hereford, who was the most skilful of her friends, said, \nWhat was to be done now?  Here was an imbecile, indolent, miserable \nKing upon the throne; wouldn\'t it be better to take him off, and \nput his son there instead?  I don\'t know whether the Queen really \npitied him at this pass, but she began to cry; so, the Bishop said, \nWell, my Lords and Gentlemen, what do you think, upon the whole, of \nsending down to Kenilworth, and seeing if His Majesty (God bless \nhim, and forbid we should depose him!) won\'t resign?\n\nMy Lords and Gentlemen thought it a good notion, so a deputation of \nthem went down to Kenilworth; and there the King came into the \ngreat hall of the Castle, commonly dressed in a poor black gown; \nand when he saw a certain bishop among them, fell down, poor \nfeeble-headed man, and made a wretched spectacle of himself.  \nSomebody lifted him up, and then SIR WILLIAM TRUSSEL, the Speaker \nof the House of Commons, almost frightened him to death by making \nhim a tremendous speech to the effect that he was no longer a King, \nand that everybody renounced allegiance to him.  After which, SIR \nTHOMAS BLOUNT, the Steward of the Household, nearly finished him, \nby coming forward and breaking his white wand - which was a \nceremony only performed at a King\'s death.  Being asked in this \npressing manner what he thought of resigning, the King said he \nthought it was the best thing he could do.  So, he did it, and they \nproclaimed his son next day.\n\nI wish I could close his history by saying that he lived a harmless \nlife in the Castle and the Castle gardens at Kenilworth, many years \n- that he had a favourite, and plenty to eat and drink - and, \nhaving that, wanted nothing.  But he was shamefully humiliated.  He \nwas outraged, and slighted, and had dirty water from ditches given \nhim to shave with, and wept and said he would have clean warm \nwater, and was altogether very miserable.  He was moved from this \ncastle to that castle, and from that castle to the other castle, \nbecause this lord or that lord, or the other lord, was too kind to \nhim:  until at last he came to Berkeley Castle, near the River \nSevern, where (the Lord Berkeley being then ill and absent) he fell \ninto the hands of two black ruffians, called THOMAS GOURNAY and \nWILLIAM OGLE.\n\nOne night - it was the night of September the twenty-first, one \nthousand three hundred and twenty-seven - dreadful screams were \nheard, by the startled people in the neighbouring town, ringing \nthrough the thick walls of the Castle, and the dark, deep night; \nand they said, as they were thus horribly awakened from their \nsleep, \'May Heaven be merciful to the King; for those cries forbode \nthat no good is being done to him in his dismal prison!\'  Next \nmorning he was dead - not bruised, or stabbed, or marked upon the \nbody, but much distorted in the face; and it was whispered \nafterwards, that those two villains, Gournay and Ogle, had burnt up \nhis inside with a red-hot iron.\n\nIf you ever come near Gloucester, and see the centre tower of its \nbeautiful Cathedral, with its four rich pinnacles, rising lightly \nin the air; you may remember that the wretched Edward the Second \nwas buried in the old abbey of that ancient city, at forty-three \nyears old, after being for nineteen years and a half a perfectly \nincapable King.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE THIRD\n\n\n\nROGER MORTIMER, the Queen\'s lover (who escaped to France in the \nlast chapter), was far from profiting by the examples he had had of \nthe fate of favourites.  Having, through the Queen\'s influence, \ncome into possession of the estates of the two Despensers, he \nbecame extremely proud and ambitious, and sought to be the real \nruler of England.  The young King, who was crowned at fourteen \nyears of age with all the usual solemnities, resolved not to bear \nthis, and soon pursued Mortimer to his ruin.\n\nThe people themselves were not fond of Mortimer - first, because he \nwas a Royal favourite; secondly, because he was supposed to have \nhelped to make a peace with Scotland which now took place, and in \nvirtue of which the young King\'s sister Joan, only seven years old, \nwas promised in marriage to David, the son and heir of Robert \nBruce, who was only five years old.  The nobles hated Mortimer \nbecause of his pride, riches, and power.  They went so far as to \ntake up arms against him; but were obliged to submit.  The Earl of \nKent, one of those who did so, but who afterwards went over to \nMortimer and the Queen, was made an example of in the following \ncruel manner:\n\nHe seems to have been anything but a wise old earl; and he was \npersuaded by the agents of the favourite and the Queen, that poor \nKing Edward the Second was not really dead; and thus was betrayed \ninto writing letters favouring his rightful claim to the throne.  \nThis was made out to be high treason, and he was tried, found \nguilty, and sentenced to be executed.  They took the poor old lord \noutside the town of Winchester, and there kept him waiting some \nthree or four hours until they could find somebody to cut off his \nhead.  At last, a convict said he would do it, if the government \nwould pardon him in return; and they gave him the pardon; and at \none blow he put the Earl of Kent out of his last suspense.\n\nWhile the Queen was in France, she had found a lovely and good \nyoung lady, named Philippa, who she thought would make an excellent \nwife for her son.  The young King married this lady, soon after he \ncame to the throne; and her first child, Edward, Prince of Wales, \nafterwards became celebrated, as we shall presently see, under the \nfamous title of EDWARD THE BLACK PRINCE.\n\nThe young King, thinking the time ripe for the downfall of \nMortimer, took counsel with Lord Montacute how he should proceed.  \nA Parliament was going to be held at Nottingham, and that lord \nrecommended that the favourite should be seized by night in \nNottingham Castle, where he was sure to be.  Now, this, like many \nother things, was more easily said than done; because, to guard \nagainst treachery, the great gates of the Castle were locked every \nnight, and the great keys were carried up-stairs to the Queen, who \nlaid them under her own pillow.  But the Castle had a governor, and \nthe governor being Lord Montacute\'s friend, confided to him how he \nknew of a secret passage underground, hidden from observation by \nthe weeds and brambles with which it was overgrown; and how, \nthrough that passage, the conspirators might enter in the dead of \nthe night, and go straight to Mortimer\'s room.  Accordingly, upon a \ncertain dark night, at midnight, they made their way through this \ndismal place:  startling the rats, and frightening the owls and \nbats:  and came safely to the bottom of the main tower of the \nCastle, where the King met them, and took them up a profoundly-dark \nstaircase in a deep silence.  They soon heard the voice of Mortimer \nin council with some friends; and bursting into the room with a \nsudden noise, took him prisoner.  The Queen cried out from her bed-\nchamber, \'Oh, my sweet son, my dear son, spare my gentle Mortimer!\'  \nThey carried him off, however; and, before the next Parliament, \naccused him of having made differences between the young King and \nhis mother, and of having brought about the death of the Earl of \nKent, and even of the late King; for, as you know by this time, \nwhen they wanted to get rid of a man in those old days, they were \nnot very particular of what they accused him.  Mortimer was found \nguilty of all this, and was sentenced to be hanged at Tyburn.  The \nKing shut his mother up in genteel confinement, where she passed \nthe rest of her life; and now he became King in earnest.\n\nThe first effort he made was to conquer Scotland.  The English \nlords who had lands in Scotland, finding that their rights were not \nrespected under the late peace, made war on their own account:  \nchoosing for their general, Edward, the son of John Baliol, who \nmade such a vigorous fight, that in less than two months he won the \nwhole Scottish Kingdom.  He was joined, when thus triumphant, by \nthe King and Parliament; and he and the King in person besieged the \nScottish forces in Berwick.  The whole Scottish army coming to the \nassistance of their countrymen, such a furious battle ensued, that \nthirty thousand men are said to have been killed in it.  Baliol was \nthen crowned King of Scotland, doing homage to the King of England; \nbut little came of his successes after all, for the Scottish men \nrose against him, within no very long time, and David Bruce came \nback within ten years and took his kingdom.\n\nFrance was a far richer country than Scotland, and the King had a \nmuch greater mind to conquer it.  So, he let Scotland alone, and \npretended that he had a claim to the French throne in right of his \nmother.  He had, in reality, no claim at all; but that mattered \nlittle in those times.  He brought over to his cause many little \nprinces and sovereigns, and even courted the alliance of the people \nof Flanders - a busy, working community, who had very small respect \nfor kings, and whose head man was a brewer.  With such forces as he \nraised by these means, Edward invaded France; but he did little by \nthat, except run into debt in carrying on the war to the extent of \nthree hundred thousand pounds.  The next year he did better; \ngaining a great sea-fight in the harbour of Sluys.  This success, \nhowever, was very shortlived, for the Flemings took fright at the \nsiege of Saint Omer and ran away, leaving their weapons and baggage \nbehind them.  Philip, the French King, coming up with his army, and \nEdward being very anxious to decide the war, proposed to settle the \ndifference by single combat with him, or by a fight of one hundred \nknights on each side.  The French King said, he thanked him; but \nbeing very well as he was, he would rather not.  So, after some \nskirmishing and talking, a short peace was made.\n\nIt was soon broken by King Edward\'s favouring the cause of John, \nEarl of Montford; a French nobleman, who asserted a claim of his \nown against the French King, and offered to do homage to England \nfor the Crown of France, if he could obtain it through England\'s \nhelp.  This French lord, himself, was soon defeated by the French \nKing\'s son, and shut up in a tower in Paris; but his wife, a \ncourageous and beautiful woman, who is said to have had the courage \nof a man, and the heart of a lion, assembled the people of \nBrittany, where she then was; and, showing them her infant son, \nmade many pathetic entreaties to them not to desert her and their \nyoung Lord.  They took fire at this appeal, and rallied round her \nin the strong castle of Hennebon.  Here she was not only besieged \nwithout by the French under Charles de Blois, but was endangered \nwithin by a dreary old bishop, who was always representing to the \npeople what horrors they must undergo if they were faithful - first \nfrom famine, and afterwards from fire and sword.  But this noble \nlady, whose heart never failed her, encouraged her soldiers by her \nown example; went from post to post like a great general; even \nmounted on horseback fully armed, and, issuing from the castle by a \nby-path, fell upon the French camp, set fire to the tents, and \nthrew the whole force into disorder.  This done, she got safely \nback to Hennebon again, and was received with loud shouts of joy by \nthe defenders of the castle, who had given her up for lost.  As \nthey were now very short of provisions, however, and as they could \nnot dine off enthusiasm, and as the old bishop was always saying, \n\'I told you what it would come to!\' they began to lose heart, and \nto talk of yielding the castle up.  The brave Countess retiring to \nan upper room and looking with great grief out to sea, where she \nexpected relief from England, saw, at this very time, the English \nships in the distance, and was relieved and rescued!  Sir Walter \nManning, the English commander, so admired her courage, that, being \ncome into the castle with the English knights, and having made a \nfeast there, he assaulted the French by way of dessert, and beat \nthem off triumphantly.  Then he and the knights came back to the \ncastle with great joy; and the Countess who had watched them from a \nhigh tower, thanked them with all her heart, and kissed them every \none.\n\nThis noble lady distinguished herself afterwards in a sea-fight \nwith the French off Guernsey, when she was on her way to England to \nask for more troops.  Her great spirit roused another lady, the \nwife of another French lord (whom the French King very barbarously \nmurdered), to distinguish herself scarcely less.  The time was fast \ncoming, however, when Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be the great \nstar of this French and English war.\n\nIt was in the month of July, in the year one thousand three hundred \nand forty-six, when the King embarked at Southampton for France, \nwith an army of about thirty thousand men in all, attended by the \nPrince of Wales and by several of the chief nobles.  He landed at \nLa Hogue in Normandy; and, burning and destroying as he went, \naccording to custom, advanced up the left bank of the River Seine, \nand fired the small towns even close to Paris; but, being watched \nfrom the right bank of the river by the French King and all his \narmy, it came to this at last, that Edward found himself, on \nSaturday the twenty-sixth of August, one thousand three hundred and \nforty-six, on a rising ground behind the little French village of \nCrecy, face to face with the French King\'s force.  And, although \nthe French King had an enormous army - in number more than eight \ntimes his - he there resolved to beat him or be beaten.\n\nThe young Prince, assisted by the Earl of Oxford and the Earl of \nWarwick, led the first division of the English army; two other \ngreat Earls led the second; and the King, the third.  When the \nmorning dawned, the King received the sacrament, and heard prayers, \nand then, mounted on horseback with a white wand in his hand, rode \nfrom company to company, and rank to rank, cheering and encouraging \nboth officers and men.  Then the whole army breakfasted, each man \nsitting on the ground where he had stood; and then they remained \nquietly on the ground with their weapons ready.\n\nUp came the French King with all his great force.  It was dark and \nangry weather; there was an eclipse of the sun; there was a \nthunder-storm, accompanied with tremendous rain; the frightened \nbirds flew screaming above the soldiers\' heads.  A certain captain \nin the French army advised the French King, who was by no means \ncheerful, not to begin the battle until the morrow.  The King, \ntaking this advice, gave the word to halt.  But, those behind not \nunderstanding it, or desiring to be foremost with the rest, came \npressing on.  The roads for a great distance were covered with this \nimmense army, and with the common people from the villages, who \nwere flourishing their rude weapons, and making a great noise.  \nOwing to these circumstances, the French army advanced in the \ngreatest confusion; every French lord doing what he liked with his \nown men, and putting out the men of every other French lord.\n\nNow, their King relied strongly upon a great body of cross-bowmen \nfrom Genoa; and these he ordered to the front to begin the battle, \non finding that he could not stop it.  They shouted once, they \nshouted twice, they shouted three times, to alarm the English \narchers; but, the English would have heard them shout three \nthousand times and would have never moved.  At last the cross-\nbowmen went forward a little, and began to discharge their bolts; \nupon which, the English let fly such a hail of arrows, that the \nGenoese speedily made off - for their cross-bows, besides being \nheavy to carry, required to be wound up with a handle, and \nconsequently took time to re-load; the English, on the other hand, \ncould discharge their arrows almost as fast as the arrows could \nfly.\n\nWhen the French King saw the Genoese turning, he cried out to his \nmen to kill those scoundrels, who were doing harm instead of \nservice.  This increased the confusion.  Meanwhile the English \narchers, continuing to shoot as fast as ever, shot down great \nnumbers of the French soldiers and knights; whom certain sly \nCornish-men and Welshmen, from the English army, creeping along the \nground, despatched with great knives.\n\nThe Prince and his division were at this time so hard-pressed, that \nthe Earl of Warwick sent a message to the King, who was overlooking \nthe battle from a windmill, beseeching him to send more aid.\n\n\'Is my son killed?\' said the King.\n\n\'No, sire, please God,\' returned the messenger.\n\n\'Is he wounded?\' said the King.\n\n\'No, sire.\'\n\n\'Is he thrown to the ground?\' said the King.\n\n\'No, sire, not so; but, he is very hard-pressed.\'\n\n\'Then,\' said the King, \'go back to those who sent you, and tell \nthem I shall send no aid; because I set my heart upon my son \nproving himself this day a brave knight, and because I am resolved, \nplease God, that the honour of a great victory shall be his!\'\n\nThese bold words, being reported to the Prince and his division, so \nraised their spirits, that they fought better than ever.  The King \nof France charged gallantly with his men many times; but it was of \nno use.  Night closing in, his horse was killed under him by an \nEnglish arrow, and the knights and nobles who had clustered thick \nabout him early in the day, were now completely scattered.  At \nlast, some of his few remaining followers led him off the field by \nforce since he would not retire of himself, and they journeyed away \nto Amiens.  The victorious English, lighting their watch-fires, \nmade merry on the field, and the King, riding to meet his gallant \nson, took him in his arms, kissed him, and told him that he had \nacted nobly, and proved himself worthy of the day and of the crown.  \nWhile it was yet night, King Edward was hardly aware of the great \nvictory he had gained; but, next day, it was discovered that eleven \nprinces, twelve hundred knights, and thirty thousand common men lay \ndead upon the French side.  Among these was the King of Bohemia, an \nold blind man; who, having been told that his son was wounded in \nthe battle, and that no force could stand against the Black Prince, \ncalled to him two knights, put himself on horse-back between them, \nfastened the three bridles together, and dashed in among the \nEnglish, where he was presently slain.  He bore as his crest three \nwhite ostrich feathers, with the motto ICH DIEN, signifying in \nEnglish \'I serve.\'  This crest and motto were taken by the Prince \nof Wales in remembrance of that famous day, and have been borne by \nthe Prince of Wales ever since.\n\nFive days after this great battle, the King laid siege to Calais.  \nThis siege - ever afterwards memorable - lasted nearly a year.  In \norder to starve the inhabitants out, King Edward built so many \nwooden houses for the lodgings of his troops, that it is said their \nquarters looked like a second Calais suddenly sprung around the \nfirst.  Early in the siege, the governor of the town drove out what \nhe called the useless mouths, to the number of seventeen hundred \npersons, men and women, young and old.  King Edward allowed them to \npass through his lines, and even fed them, and dismissed them with \nmoney; but, later in the siege, he was not so merciful - five \nhundred more, who were afterwards driven out, dying of starvation \nand misery.  The garrison were so hard-pressed at last, that they \nsent a letter to King Philip, telling him that they had eaten all \nthe horses, all the dogs, and all the rats and mice that could be \nfound in the place; and, that if he did not relieve them, they must \neither surrender to the English, or eat one another.  Philip made \none effort to give them relief; but they were so hemmed in by the \nEnglish power, that he could not succeed, and was fain to leave the \nplace.  Upon this they hoisted the English flag, and surrendered to \nKing Edward.  \'Tell your general,\' said he to the humble messengers \nwho came out of the town, \'that I require to have sent here, six of \nthe most distinguished citizens, bare-legged, and in their shirts, \nwith ropes about their necks; and let those six men bring with them \nthe keys of the castle and the town.\'\n\nWhen the Governor of Calais related this to the people in the \nMarket-place, there was great weeping and distress; in the midst of \nwhich, one worthy citizen, named Eustace de Saint Pierre, rose up \nand said, that if the six men required were not sacrificed, the \nwhole population would be; therefore, he offered himself as the \nfirst.  Encouraged by this bright example, five other worthy \ncitizens rose up one after another, and offered themselves to save \nthe rest.  The Governor, who was too badly wounded to be able to \nwalk, mounted a poor old horse that had not been eaten, and \nconducted these good men to the gate, while all the people cried \nand mourned.\n\nEdward received them wrathfully, and ordered the heads of the whole \nsix to be struck off.  However, the good Queen fell upon her knees, \nand besought the King to give them up to her.  The King replied, \'I \nwish you had been somewhere else; but I cannot refuse you.\'  So she \nhad them properly dressed, made a feast for them, and sent them \nback with a handsome present, to the great rejoicing of the whole \ncamp.  I hope the people of Calais loved the daughter to whom she \ngave birth soon afterwards, for her gentle mother\'s sake.\n\nNow came that terrible disease, the Plague, into Europe, hurrying \nfrom the heart of China; and killed the wretched people - \nespecially the poor - in such enormous numbers, that one-half of \nthe inhabitants of England are related to have died of it.  It \nkilled the cattle, in great numbers, too; and so few working men \nremained alive, that there were not enough left to till the ground.\n\nAfter eight years of differing and quarrelling, the Prince of Wales \nagain invaded France with an army of sixty thousand men.  He went \nthrough the south of the country, burning and plundering \nwheresoever he went; while his father, who had still the Scottish \nwar upon his hands, did the like in Scotland, but was harassed and \nworried in his retreat from that country by the Scottish men, who \nrepaid his cruelties with interest.\n\nThe French King, Philip, was now dead, and was succeeded by his son \nJohn.  The Black Prince, called by that name from the colour of the \narmour he wore to set off his fair complexion, continuing to burn \nand destroy in France, roused John into determined opposition; and \nso cruel had the Black Prince been in his campaign, and so severely \nhad the French peasants suffered, that he could not find one who, \nfor love, or money, or the fear of death, would tell him what the \nFrench King was doing, or where he was.  Thus it happened that he \ncame upon the French King\'s forces, all of a sudden, near the town \nof Poitiers, and found that the whole neighbouring country was \noccupied by a vast French army.  \'God help us!\' said the Black \nPrince, \'we must make the best of it.\'\n\nSo, on a Sunday morning, the eighteenth of September, the Prince \nwhose army was now reduced to ten thousand men in all - prepared to \ngive battle to the French King, who had sixty thousand horse alone.  \nWhile he was so engaged, there came riding from the French camp, a \nCardinal, who had persuaded John to let him offer terms, and try to \nsave the shedding of Christian blood.  \'Save my honour,\' said the \nPrince to this good priest, \'and save the honour of my army, and I \nwill make any reasonable terms.\'  He offered to give up all the \ntowns, castles, and prisoners, he had taken, and to swear to make \nno war in France for seven years; but, as John would hear of \nnothing but his surrender, with a hundred of his chief knights, the \ntreaty was broken off, and the Prince said quietly - \'God defend \nthe right; we shall fight to-morrow.\'\n\nTherefore, on the Monday morning, at break of day, the two armies \nprepared for battle.  The English were posted in a strong place, \nwhich could only be approached by one narrow lane, skirted by \nhedges on both sides.  The French attacked them by this lane; but \nwere so galled and slain by English arrows from behind the hedges, \nthat they were forced to retreat.  Then went six hundred English \nbowmen round about, and, coming upon the rear of the French army, \nrained arrows on them thick and fast.  The French knights, thrown \ninto confusion, quitted their banners and dispersed in all \ndirections.  Said Sir John Chandos to the Prince, \'Ride forward, \nnoble Prince, and the day is yours.  The King of France is so \nvaliant a gentleman, that I know he will never fly, and may be \ntaken prisoner.\'  Said the Prince to this, \'Advance, English \nbanners, in the name of God and St. George!\' and on they pressed \nuntil they came up with the French King, fighting fiercely with his \nbattle-axe, and, when all his nobles had forsaken him, attended \nfaithfully to the last by his youngest son Philip, only sixteen \nyears of age.  Father and son fought well, and the King had already \ntwo wounds in his face, and had been beaten down, when he at last \ndelivered himself to a banished French knight, and gave him his \nright-hand glove in token that he had done so.\n\nThe Black Prince was generous as well as brave, and he invited his \nroyal prisoner to supper in his tent, and waited upon him at table, \nand, when they afterwards rode into London in a gorgeous \nprocession, mounted the French King on a fine cream-coloured horse, \nand rode at his side on a little pony.  This was all very kind, but \nI think it was, perhaps, a little theatrical too, and has been made \nmore meritorious than it deserved to be; especially as I am \ninclined to think that the greatest kindness to the King of France \nwould have been not to have shown him to the people at all.  \nHowever, it must be said, for these acts of politeness, that, in \ncourse of time, they did much to soften the horrors of war and the \npassions of conquerors.  It was a long, long time before the common \nsoldiers began to have the benefit of such courtly deeds; but they \ndid at last; and thus it is possible that a poor soldier who asked \nfor quarter at the battle of Waterloo, or any other such great \nfight, may have owed his life indirectly to Edward the Black \nPrince.\n\nAt this time there stood in the Strand, in London, a palace called \nthe Savoy, which was given up to the captive King of France and his \nson for their residence.  As the King of Scotland had now been King \nEdward\'s captive for eleven years too, his success was, at this \ntime, tolerably complete.  The Scottish business was settled by the \nprisoner being released under the title of Sir David, King of \nScotland, and by his engaging to pay a large ransom.  The state of \nFrance encouraged England to propose harder terms to that country, \nwhere the people rose against the unspeakable cruelty and barbarity \nof its nobles; where the nobles rose in turn against the people; \nwhere the most frightful outrages were committed on all sides; and \nwhere the insurrection of the peasants, called the insurrection of \nthe Jacquerie, from Jacques, a common Christian name among the \ncountry people of France, awakened terrors and hatreds that have \nscarcely yet passed away.  A treaty called the Great Peace, was at \nlast signed, under which King Edward agreed to give up the greater \npart of his conquests, and King John to pay, within six years, a \nransom of three million crowns of gold.  He was so beset by his own \nnobles and courtiers for having yielded to these conditions - \nthough they could help him to no better - that he came back of his \nown will to his old palace-prison of the Savoy, and there died.\n\nThere was a Sovereign of Castile at that time, called PEDRO THE \nCRUEL, who deserved the name remarkably well:  having committed, \namong other cruelties, a variety of murders.  This amiable monarch \nbeing driven from his throne for his crimes, went to the province \nof Bordeaux, where the Black Prince - now married to his cousin \nJOAN, a pretty widow - was residing, and besought his help.  The \nPrince, who took to him much more kindly than a prince of such fame \nought to have taken to such a ruffian, readily listened to his fair \npromises, and agreeing to help him, sent secret orders to some \ntroublesome disbanded soldiers of his and his father\'s, who called \nthemselves the Free Companions, and who had been a pest to the \nFrench people, for some time, to aid this Pedro.  The Prince, \nhimself, going into Spain to head the army of relief, soon set \nPedro on his throne again - where he no sooner found himself, than, \nof course, he behaved like the villain he was, broke his word \nwithout the least shame, and abandoned all the promises he had made \nto the Black Prince.\n\nNow, it had cost the Prince a good deal of money to pay soldiers to \nsupport this murderous King; and finding himself, when he came back \ndisgusted to Bordeaux, not only in bad health, but deeply in debt, \nhe began to tax his French subjects to pay his creditors.  They \nappealed to the French King, CHARLES; war again broke out; and the \nFrench town of Limoges, which the Prince had greatly benefited, \nwent over to the French King.  Upon this he ravaged the province of \nwhich it was the capital; burnt, and plundered, and killed in the \nold sickening way; and refused mercy to the prisoners, men, women, \nand children taken in the offending town, though he was so ill and \nso much in need of pity himself from Heaven, that he was carried in \na litter.  He lived to come home and make himself popular with the \npeople and Parliament, and he died on Trinity Sunday, the eighth of \nJune, one thousand three hundred and seventy-six, at forty-six \nyears old.\n\nThe whole nation mourned for him as one of the most renowned and \nbeloved princes it had ever had; and he was buried with great \nlamentations in Canterbury Cathedral.  Near to the tomb of Edward \nthe Confessor, his monument, with his figure, carved in stone, and \nrepresented in the old black armour, lying on its back, may be seen \nat this day, with an ancient coat of mail, a helmet, and a pair of \ngauntlets hanging from a beam above it, which most people like to \nbelieve were once worn by the Black Prince.\n\nKing Edward did not outlive his renowned son, long.  He was old, \nand one Alice Perrers, a beautiful lady, had contrived to make him \nso fond of her in his old age, that he could refuse her nothing, \nand made himself ridiculous.  She little deserved his love, or - \nwhat I dare say she valued a great deal more - the jewels of the \nlate Queen, which he gave her among other rich presents.  She took \nthe very ring from his finger on the morning of the day when he \ndied, and left him to be pillaged by his faithless servants.  Only \none good priest was true to him, and attended him to the last.\n\nBesides being famous for the great victories I have related, the \nreign of King Edward the Third was rendered memorable in better \nways, by the growth of architecture and the erection of Windsor \nCastle.  In better ways still, by the rising up of WICKLIFFE, \noriginally a poor parish priest:  who devoted himself to exposing, \nwith wonderful power and success, the ambition and corruption of \nthe Pope, and of the whole church of which he was the head.\n\nSome of those Flemings were induced to come to England in this \nreign too, and to settle in Norfolk, where they made better woollen \ncloths than the English had ever had before.  The Order of the \nGarter (a very fine thing in its way, but hardly so important as \ngood clothes for the nation) also dates from this period.  The King \nis said to have picked \'up a lady\'s garter at a ball, and to have \nsaid, HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE - in English, \'Evil be to him who \nevil thinks of it.\'  The courtiers were usually glad to imitate \nwhat the King said or did, and hence from a slight incident the \nOrder of the Garter was instituted, and became a great dignity.  So \nthe story goes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX - ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE SECOND\n\n\n\nRICHARD, son of the Black Prince, a boy eleven years of age, \nsucceeded to the Crown under the title of King Richard the Second.  \nThe whole English nation were ready to admire him for the sake of \nhis brave father.  As to the lords and ladies about the Court, they \ndeclared him to be the most beautiful, the wisest, and the best - \neven of princes - whom the lords and ladies about the Court, \ngenerally declare to be the most beautiful, the wisest, and the \nbest of mankind.  To flatter a poor boy in this base manner was not \na very likely way to develop whatever good was in him; and it \nbrought him to anything but a good or happy end.\n\nThe Duke of Lancaster, the young King\'s uncle - commonly called \nJohn of Gaunt, from having been born at Ghent, which the common \npeople so pronounced - was supposed to have some thoughts of the \nthrone himself; but, as he was not popular, and the memory of the \nBlack Prince was, he submitted to his nephew.\n\nThe war with France being still unsettled, the Government of \nEngland wanted money to provide for the expenses that might arise \nout of it; accordingly a certain tax, called the Poll-tax, which \nhad originated in the last reign, was ordered to be levied on the \npeople.  This was a tax on every person in the kingdom, male and \nfemale, above the age of fourteen, of three groats (or three four-\npenny pieces) a year; clergymen were charged more, and only beggars \nwere exempt.\n\nI have no need to repeat that the common people of England had long \nbeen suffering under great oppression.  They were still the mere \nslaves of the lords of the land on which they lived, and were on \nmost occasions harshly and unjustly treated.  But, they had begun \nby this time to think very seriously of not bearing quite so much; \nand, probably, were emboldened by that French insurrection I \nmentioned in the last chapter.\n\nThe people of Essex rose against the Poll-tax, and being severely \nhandled by the government officers, killed some of them.  At this \nvery time one of the tax-collectors, going his rounds from house to \nhouse, at Dartford in Kent came to the cottage of one WAT, a tiler \nby trade, and claimed the tax upon his daughter.  Her mother, who \nwas at home, declared that she was under the age of fourteen; upon \nthat, the collector (as other collectors had already done in \ndifferent parts of England) behaved in a savage way, and brutally \ninsulted Wat Tyler\'s daughter.  The daughter screamed, the mother \nscreamed.  Wat the Tiler, who was at work not far off, ran to the \nspot, and did what any honest father under such provocation might \nhave done - struck the collector dead at a blow.\n\nInstantly the people of that town uprose as one man.  They made Wat \nTyler their leader; they joined with the people of Essex, who were \nin arms under a priest called JACK STRAW; they took out of prison \nanother priest named JOHN BALL; and gathering in numbers as they \nwent along, advanced, in a great confused army of poor men, to \nBlackheath.  It is said that they wanted to abolish all property, \nand to declare all men equal.  I do not think this very likely; \nbecause they stopped the travellers on the roads and made them \nswear to be true to King Richard and the people.  Nor were they at \nall disposed to injure those who had done them no harm, merely \nbecause they were of high station; for, the King\'s mother, who had \nto pass through their camp at Blackheath, on her way to her young \nson, lying for safety in the Tower of London, had merely to kiss a \nfew dirty-faced rough-bearded men who were noisily fond of royalty, \nand so got away in perfect safety.  Next day the whole mass marched \non to London Bridge.\n\nThere was a drawbridge in the middle, which WILLIAM WALWORTH the \nMayor caused to be raised to prevent their coming into the city; \nbut they soon terrified the citizens into lowering it again, and \nspread themselves, with great uproar, over the streets.  They broke \nopen the prisons; they burned the papers in Lambeth Palace; they \ndestroyed the DUKE OF LANCASTER\'S Palace, the Savoy, in the Strand, \nsaid to be the most beautiful and splendid in England; they set \nfire to the books and documents in the Temple; and made a great \nriot.  Many of these outrages were committed in drunkenness; since \nthose citizens, who had well-filled cellars, were only too glad to \nthrow them open to save the rest of their property; but even the \ndrunken rioters were very careful to steal nothing.  They were so \nangry with one man, who was seen to take a silver cup at the Savoy \nPalace, and put it in his breast, that they drowned him in the \nriver, cup and all.\n\nThe young King had been taken out to treat with them before they \ncommitted these excesses; but, he and the people about him were so \nfrightened by the riotous shouts, that they got back to the Tower \nin the best way they could.  This made the insurgents bolder; so \nthey went on rioting away, striking off the heads of those who did \nnot, at a moment\'s notice, declare for King Richard and the people; \nand killing as many of the unpopular persons whom they supposed to \nbe their enemies as they could by any means lay hold of.  In this \nmanner they passed one very violent day, and then proclamation was \nmade that the King would meet them at Mile-end, and grant their \nrequests.\n\nThe rioters went to Mile-end to the number of sixty thousand, and \nthe King met them there, and to the King the rioters peaceably \nproposed four conditions.  First, that neither they, nor their \nchildren, nor any coming after them, should be made slaves any \nmore.  Secondly, that the rent of land should be fixed at a certain \nprice in money, instead of being paid in service.  Thirdly, that \nthey should have liberty to buy and sell in all markets and public \nplaces, like other free men.  Fourthly, that they should be \npardoned for past offences.  Heaven knows, there was nothing very \nunreasonable in these proposals!  The young King deceitfully \npretended to think so, and kept thirty clerks up, all night, \nwriting out a charter accordingly.\n\nNow, Wat Tyler himself wanted more than this.  He wanted the entire \nabolition of the forest laws.  He was not at Mile-end with the \nrest, but, while that meeting was being held, broke into the Tower \nof London and slew the archbishop and the treasurer, for whose \nheads the people had cried out loudly the day before.  He and his \nmen even thrust their swords into the bed of the Princess of Wales \nwhile the Princess was in it, to make certain that none of their \nenemies were concealed there.\n\nSo, Wat and his men still continued armed, and rode about the city.  \nNext morning, the King with a small train of some sixty gentlemen - \namong whom was WALWORTH the Mayor - rode into Smithfield, and saw \nWat and his people at a little distance.  Says Wat to his men, \n\'There is the King.  I will go speak with him, and tell him what we \nwant.\'\n\nStraightway Wat rode up to him, and began to talk.  \'King,\' says \nWat, \'dost thou see all my men there?\'\n\n\'Ah,\' says the King.  \'Why?\'\n\n\'Because,\' says Wat, \'they are all at my command, and have sworn to \ndo whatever I bid them.\'\n\nSome declared afterwards that as Wat said this, he laid his hand on \nthe King\'s bridle.  Others declared that he was seen to play with \nhis own dagger.  I think, myself, that he just spoke to the King \nlike a rough, angry man as he was, and did nothing more.  At any \nrate he was expecting no attack, and preparing for no resistance, \nwhen Walworth the Mayor did the not very valiant deed of drawing a \nshort sword and stabbing him in the throat.  He dropped from his \nhorse, and one of the King\'s people speedily finished him.  So fell \nWat Tyler.  Fawners and flatterers made a mighty triumph of it, and \nset up a cry which will occasionally find an echo to this day.  But \nWat was a hard-working man, who had suffered much, and had been \nfoully outraged; and it is probable that he was a man of a much \nhigher nature and a much braver spirit than any of the parasites \nwho exulted then, or have exulted since, over his defeat.\n\nSeeing Wat down, his men immediately bent their bows to avenge his \nfall.  If the young King had not had presence of mind at that \ndangerous moment, both he and the Mayor to boot, might have \nfollowed Tyler pretty fast.  But the King riding up to the crowd, \ncried out that Tyler was a traitor, and that he would be their \nleader.  They were so taken by surprise, that they set up a great \nshouting, and followed the boy until he was met at Islington by a \nlarge body of soldiers.\n\nThe end of this rising was the then usual end.  As soon as the King \nfound himself safe, he unsaid all he had said, and undid all he had \ndone; some fifteen hundred of the rioters were tried (mostly in \nEssex) with great rigour, and executed with great cruelty.  Many of \nthem were hanged on gibbets, and left there as a terror to the \ncountry people; and, because their miserable friends took some of \nthe bodies down to bury, the King ordered the rest to be chained up \n- which was the beginning of the barbarous custom of hanging in \nchains.  The King\'s falsehood in this business makes such a pitiful \nfigure, that I think Wat Tyler appears in history as beyond \ncomparison the truer and more respectable man of the two.\n\nRichard was now sixteen years of age, and married Anne of Bohemia, \nan excellent princess, who was called \'the good Queen Anne.\'  She \ndeserved a better husband; for the King had been fawned and \nflattered into a treacherous, wasteful, dissolute, bad young man.\n\nThere were two Popes at this time (as if one were not enough!), and \ntheir quarrels involved Europe in a great deal of trouble.  \nScotland was still troublesome too; and at home there was much \njealousy and distrust, and plotting and counter-plotting, because \nthe King feared the ambition of his relations, and particularly of \nhis uncle, the Duke of Lancaster, and the duke had his party \nagainst the King, and the King had his party against the duke.  Nor \nwere these home troubles lessened when the duke went to Castile to \nurge his claim to the crown of that kingdom; for then the Duke of \nGloucester, another of Richard\'s uncles, opposed him, and \ninfluenced the Parliament to demand the dismissal of the King\'s \nfavourite ministers.  The King said in reply, that he would not for \nsuch men dismiss the meanest servant in his kitchen.  But, it had \nbegun to signify little what a King said when a Parliament was \ndetermined; so Richard was at last obliged to give way, and to \nagree to another Government of the kingdom, under a commission of \nfourteen nobles, for a year.  His uncle of Gloucester was at the \nhead of this commission, and, in fact, appointed everybody \ncomposing it.\n\nHaving done all this, the King declared as soon as he saw an \nopportunity that he had never meant to do it, and that it was all \nillegal; and he got the judges secretly to sign a declaration to \nthat effect.  The secret oozed out directly, and was carried to the \nDuke of Gloucester.  The Duke of Gloucester, at the head of forty \nthousand men, met the King on his entering into London to enforce \nhis authority; the King was helpless against him; his favourites \nand ministers were impeached and were mercilessly executed.  Among \nthem were two men whom the people regarded with very different \nfeelings; one, Robert Tresilian, Chief Justice, who was hated for \nhaving made what was called \'the bloody circuit\' to try the \nrioters; the other, Sir Simon Burley, an honourable knight, who had \nbeen the dear friend of the Black Prince, and the governor and \nguardian of the King.  For this gentleman\'s life the good Queen \neven begged of Gloucester on her knees; but Gloucester (with or \nwithout reason) feared and hated him, and replied, that if she \nvalued her husband\'s crown, she had better beg no more.  All this \nwas done under what was called by some the wonderful - and by \nothers, with better reason, the merciless - Parliament.\n\nBut Gloucester\'s power was not to last for ever.  He held it for \nonly a year longer; in which year the famous battle of Otterbourne, \nsung in the old ballad of Chevy Chase, was fought.  When the year \nwas out, the King, turning suddenly to Gloucester, in the midst of \na great council said, \'Uncle, how old am I?\'  \'Your highness,\' \nreturned the Duke, \'is in your twenty-second year.\'  \'Am I so \nmuch?\' said the King; \'then I will manage my own affairs!  I am \nmuch obliged to you, my good lords, for your past services, but I \nneed them no more.\'  He followed this up, by appointing a new \nChancellor and a new Treasurer, and announced to the people that he \nhad resumed the Government.  He held it for eight years without \nopposition.  Through all that time, he kept his determination to \nrevenge himself some day upon his uncle Gloucester, in his own \nbreast.\n\nAt last the good Queen died, and then the King, desiring to take a \nsecond wife, proposed to his council that he should marry Isabella, \nof France, the daughter of Charles the Sixth:  who, the French \ncourtiers said (as the English courtiers had said of Richard), was \na marvel of beauty and wit, and quite a phenomenon - of seven years \nold.  The council were divided about this marriage, but it took \nplace.  It secured peace between England and France for a quarter \nof a century; but it was strongly opposed to the prejudices of the \nEnglish people.  The Duke of Gloucester, who was anxious to take \nthe occasion of making himself popular, declaimed against it \nloudly, and this at length decided the King to execute the \nvengeance he had been nursing so long.\n\nHe went with a gay company to the Duke of Gloucester\'s house, \nPleshey Castle, in Essex, where the Duke, suspecting nothing, came \nout into the court-yard to receive his royal visitor.  While the \nKing conversed in a friendly manner with the Duchess, the Duke was \nquietly seized, hurried away, shipped for Calais, and lodged in the \ncastle there.  His friends, the Earls of Arundel and Warwick, were \ntaken in the same treacherous manner, and confined to their \ncastles.  A few days after, at Nottingham, they were impeached of \nhigh treason.  The Earl of Arundel was condemned and beheaded, and \nthe Earl of Warwick was banished.  Then, a writ was sent by a \nmessenger to the Governor of Calais, requiring him to send the Duke \nof Gloucester over to be tried.  In three days he returned an \nanswer that he could not do that, because the Duke of Gloucester \nhad died in prison.  The Duke was declared a traitor, his property \nwas confiscated to the King, a real or pretended confession he had \nmade in prison to one of the Justices of the Common Pleas was \nproduced against him, and there was an end of the matter.  How the \nunfortunate duke died, very few cared to know.  Whether he really \ndied naturally; whether he killed himself; whether, by the King\'s \norder, he was strangled, or smothered between two beds (as a \nserving-man of the Governor\'s named Hall, did afterwards declare), \ncannot be discovered.  There is not much doubt that he was killed, \nsomehow or other, by his nephew\'s orders.  Among the most active \nnobles in these proceedings were the King\'s cousin, Henry \nBolingbroke, whom the King had made Duke of Hereford to smooth down \nthe old family quarrels, and some others:  who had in the family-\nplotting times done just such acts themselves as they now condemned \nin the duke.  They seem to have been a corrupt set of men; but such \nmen were easily found about the court in such days.\n\nThe people murmured at all this, and were still very sore about the \nFrench marriage.  The nobles saw how little the King cared for law, \nand how crafty he was, and began to be somewhat afraid for \nthemselves.  The King\'s life was a life of continued feasting and \nexcess; his retinue, down to the meanest servants, were dressed in \nthe most costly manner, and caroused at his tables, it is related, \nto the number of ten thousand persons every day.  He himself, \nsurrounded by a body of ten thousand archers, and enriched by a \nduty on wool which the Commons had granted him for life, saw no \ndanger of ever being otherwise than powerful and absolute, and was \nas fierce and haughty as a King could be.\n\nHe had two of his old enemies left, in the persons of the Dukes of \nHereford and Norfolk.  Sparing these no more than the others, he \ntampered with the Duke of Hereford until he got him to declare \nbefore the Council that the Duke of Norfolk had lately held some \ntreasonable talk with him, as he was riding near Brentford; and \nthat he had told him, among other things, that he could not believe \nthe King\'s oath - which nobody could, I should think.  For this \ntreachery he obtained a pardon, and the Duke of Norfolk was \nsummoned to appear and defend himself.  As he denied the charge and \nsaid his accuser was a liar and a traitor, both noblemen, according \nto the manner of those times, were held in custody, and the truth \nwas ordered to be decided by wager of battle at Coventry.  This \nwager of battle meant that whosoever won the combat was to be \nconsidered in the right; which nonsense meant in effect, that no \nstrong man could ever be wrong.  A great holiday was made; a great \ncrowd assembled, with much parade and show; and the two combatants \nwere about to rush at each other with their lances, when the King, \nsitting in a pavilion to see fair, threw down the truncheon he \ncarried in his hand, and forbade the battle.  The Duke of Hereford \nwas to be banished for ten years, and the Duke of Norfolk was to be \nbanished for life.  So said the King.  The Duke of Hereford went to \nFrance, and went no farther.  The Duke of Norfolk made a pilgrimage \nto the Holy Land, and afterwards died at Venice of a broken heart.\n\nFaster and fiercer, after this, the King went on in his career.  \nThe Duke of Lancaster, who was the father of the Duke of Hereford, \ndied soon after the departure of his son; and, the King, although \nhe had solemnly granted to that son leave to inherit his father\'s \nproperty, if it should come to him during his banishment, \nimmediately seized it all, like a robber.  The judges were so \nafraid of him, that they disgraced themselves by declaring this \ntheft to be just and lawful.  His avarice knew no bounds.  He \noutlawed seventeen counties at once, on a frivolous pretence, \nmerely to raise money by way of fines for misconduct.  In short, he \ndid as many dishonest things as he could; and cared so little for \nthe discontent of his subjects - though even the spaniel favourites \nbegan to whisper to him that there was such a thing as discontent \nafloat - that he took that time, of all others, for leaving England \nand making an expedition against the Irish.\n\nHe was scarcely gone, leaving the DUKE OF YORK Regent in his \nabsence, when his cousin, Henry of Hereford, came over from France \nto claim the rights of which he had been so monstrously deprived.  \nHe was immediately joined by the two great Earls of Northumberland \nand Westmoreland; and his uncle, the Regent, finding the King\'s \ncause unpopular, and the disinclination of the army to act against \nHenry, very strong, withdrew with the Royal forces towards Bristol.  \nHenry, at the head of an army, came from Yorkshire (where he had \nlanded) to London and followed him.  They joined their forces - how \nthey brought that about, is not distinctly understood - and \nproceeded to Bristol Castle, whither three noblemen had taken the \nyoung Queen.  The castle surrendering, they presently put those \nthree noblemen to death.  The Regent then remained there, and Henry \nwent on to Chester.\n\nAll this time, the boisterous weather had prevented the King from \nreceiving intelligence of what had occurred.  At length it was \nconveyed to him in Ireland, and he sent over the EARL OF SALISBURY, \nwho, landing at Conway, rallied the Welshmen, and waited for the \nKing a whole fortnight; at the end of that time the Welshmen, who \nwere perhaps not very warm for him in the beginning, quite cooled \ndown and went home.  When the King did land on the coast at last, \nhe came with a pretty good power, but his men cared nothing for \nhim, and quickly deserted.  Supposing the Welshmen to be still at \nConway, he disguised himself as a priest, and made for that place \nin company with his two brothers and some few of their adherents.  \nBut, there were no Welshmen left - only Salisbury and a hundred \nsoldiers.  In this distress, the King\'s two brothers, Exeter and \nSurrey, offered to go to Henry to learn what his intentions were.  \nSurrey, who was true to Richard, was put into prison.  Exeter, who \nwas false, took the royal badge, which was a hart, off his shield, \nand assumed the rose, the badge of Henry.  After this, it was \npretty plain to the King what Henry\'s intentions were, without \nsending any more messengers to ask.\n\nThe fallen King, thus deserted - hemmed in on all sides, and \npressed with hunger - rode here and rode there, and went to this \ncastle, and went to that castle, endeavouring to obtain some \nprovisions, but could find none.  He rode wretchedly back to \nConway, and there surrendered himself to the Earl of \nNorthumberland, who came from Henry, in reality to take him \nprisoner, but in appearance to offer terms; and whose men were \nhidden not far off.  By this earl he was conducted to the castle of \nFlint, where his cousin Henry met him, and dropped on his knee as \nif he were still respectful to his sovereign.\n\n\'Fair cousin of Lancaster,\' said the King, \'you are very welcome\' \n(very welcome, no doubt; but he would have been more so, in chains \nor without a head).\n\n\'My lord,\' replied Henry, \'I am come a little before my time; but, \nwith your good pleasure, I will show you the reason.  Your people \ncomplain with some bitterness, that you have ruled them rigorously \nfor two-and-twenty years.  Now, if it please God, I will help you \nto govern them better in future.\'\n\n\'Fair cousin,\' replied the abject King, \'since it pleaseth you, it \npleaseth me mightily.\'\n\nAfter this, the trumpets sounded, and the King was stuck on a \nwretched horse, and carried prisoner to Chester, where he was made \nto issue a proclamation, calling a Parliament.  From Chester he was \ntaken on towards London.  At Lichfield he tried to escape by \ngetting out of a window and letting himself down into a garden; it \nwas all in vain, however, and he was carried on and shut up in the \nTower, where no one pitied him, and where the whole people, whose \npatience he had quite tired out, reproached him without mercy.  \nBefore he got there, it is related, that his very dog left him and \ndeparted from his side to lick the hand of Henry.\n\nThe day before the Parliament met, a deputation went to this \nwrecked King, and told him that he had promised the Earl of \nNorthumberland at Conway Castle to resign the crown.  He said he \nwas quite ready to do it, and signed a paper in which he renounced \nhis authority and absolved his people from their allegiance to him.  \nHe had so little spirit left that he gave his royal ring to his \ntriumphant cousin Henry with his own hand, and said, that if he \ncould have had leave to appoint a successor, that same Henry was \nthe man of all others whom he would have named.  Next day, the \nParliament assembled in Westminster Hall, where Henry sat at the \nside of the throne, which was empty and covered with a cloth of \ngold.  The paper just signed by the King was read to the multitude \namid shouts of joy, which were echoed through all the streets; when \nsome of the noise had died away, the King was formally deposed.  \nThen Henry arose, and, making the sign of the cross on his forehead \nand breast, challenged the realm of England as his right; the \narchbishops of Canterbury and York seated him on the throne.\n\nThe multitude shouted again, and the shouts re-echoed throughout \nall the streets.  No one remembered, now, that Richard the Second \nhad ever been the most beautiful, the wisest, and the best of \nprinces; and he now made living (to my thinking) a far more sorry \nspectacle in the Tower of London, than Wat Tyler had made, lying \ndead, among the hoofs of the royal horses in Smithfield.\n\nThe Poll-tax died with Wat.  The Smiths to the King and Royal \nFamily, could make no chains in which the King could hang the \npeople\'s recollection of him; so the Poll-tax was never collected.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FOURTH, CALLED BOLINGBROKE\n\n\n\nDURING the last reign, the preaching of Wickliffe against the pride \nand cunning of the Pope and all his men, had made a great noise in \nEngland.  Whether the new King wished to be in favour with the \npriests, or whether he hoped, by pretending to be very religious, \nto cheat Heaven itself into the belief that he was not a usurper, I \ndon\'t know.  Both suppositions are likely enough.  It is certain \nthat he began his reign by making a strong show against the \nfollowers of Wickliffe, who were called Lollards, or heretics - \nalthough his father, John of Gaunt, had been of that way of \nthinking, as he himself had been more than suspected of being.  It \nis no less certain that he first established in England the \ndetestable and atrocious custom, brought from abroad, of burning \nthose people as a punishment for their opinions.  It was the \nimportation into England of one of the practices of what was called \nthe Holy Inquisition:  which was the most UNholy and the most \ninfamous tribunal that ever disgraced mankind, and made men more \nlike demons than followers of Our Saviour.\n\nNo real right to the crown, as you know, was in this King.  Edward \nMortimer, the young Earl of March - who was only eight or nine \nyears old, and who was descended from the Duke of Clarence, the \nelder brother of Henry\'s father - was, by succession, the real heir \nto the throne.  However, the King got his son declared Prince of \nWales; and, obtaining possession of the young Earl of March and his \nlittle brother, kept them in confinement (but not severely) in \nWindsor Castle.  He then required the Parliament to decide what was \nto be done with the deposed King, who was quiet enough, and who \nonly said that he hoped his cousin Henry would be \'a good lord\' to \nhim.  The Parliament replied that they would recommend his being \nkept in some secret place where the people could not resort, and \nwhere his friends could not be admitted to see him.  Henry \naccordingly passed this sentence upon him, and it now began to be \npretty clear to the nation that Richard the Second would not live \nvery long.\n\nIt was a noisy Parliament, as it was an unprincipled one, and the \nLords quarrelled so violently among themselves as to which of them \nhad been loyal and which disloyal, and which consistent and which \ninconsistent, that forty gauntlets are said to have been thrown \nupon the floor at one time as challenges to as many battles:  the \ntruth being that they were all false and base together, and had \nbeen, at one time with the old King, and at another time with the \nnew one, and seldom true for any length of time to any one.  They \nsoon began to plot again.  A conspiracy was formed to invite the \nKing to a tournament at Oxford, and then to take him by surprise \nand kill him.  This murderous enterprise, which was agreed upon at \nsecret meetings in the house of the Abbot of Westminster, was \nbetrayed by the Earl of Rutland - one of the conspirators.  The \nKing, instead of going to the tournament or staying at Windsor \n(where the conspirators suddenly went, on finding themselves \ndiscovered, with the hope of seizing him), retired to London, \nproclaimed them all traitors, and advanced upon them with a great \nforce.  They retired into the west of England, proclaiming Richard \nKing; but, the people rose against them, and they were all slain.  \nTheir treason hastened the death of the deposed monarch.  Whether \nhe was killed by hired assassins, or whether he was starved to \ndeath, or whether he refused food on hearing of his brothers being \nkilled (who were in that plot), is very doubtful.  He met his death \nsomehow; and his body was publicly shown at St. Paul\'s Cathedral \nwith only the lower part of the face uncovered.  I can scarcely \ndoubt that he was killed by the King\'s orders.\n\nThe French wife of the miserable Richard was now only ten years \nold; and, when her father, Charles of France, heard of her \nmisfortunes and of her lonely condition in England, he went mad:  \nas he had several times done before, during the last five or six \nyears.  The French Dukes of Burgundy and Bourbon took up the poor \ngirl\'s cause, without caring much about it, but on the chance of \ngetting something out of England.  The people of Bordeaux, who had \na sort of superstitious attachment to the memory of Richard, \nbecause he was born there, swore by the Lord that he had been the \nbest man in all his kingdom - which was going rather far - and \npromised to do great things against the English.  Nevertheless, \nwhen they came to consider that they, and the whole people of \nFrance, were ruined by their own nobles, and that the English rule \nwas much the better of the two, they cooled down again; and the two \ndukes, although they were very great men, could do nothing without \nthem.  Then, began negotiations between France and England for the \nsending home to Paris of the poor little Queen with all her jewels \nand her fortune of two hundred thousand francs in gold.  The King \nwas quite willing to restore the young lady, and even the jewels; \nbut he said he really could not part with the money.  So, at last \nshe was safely deposited at Paris without her fortune, and then the \nDuke of Burgundy (who was cousin to the French King) began to \nquarrel with the Duke of Orleans (who was brother to the French \nKing) about the whole matter; and those two dukes made France even \nmore wretched than ever.\n\nAs the idea of conquering Scotland was still popular at home, the \nKing marched to the river Tyne and demanded homage of the King of \nthat country.  This being refused, he advanced to Edinburgh, but \ndid little there; for, his army being in want of provisions, and \nthe Scotch being very careful to hold him in check without giving \nbattle, he was obliged to retire.  It is to his immortal honour \nthat in this sally he burnt no villages and slaughtered no people, \nbut was particularly careful that his army should be merciful and \nharmless.  It was a great example in those ruthless times.\n\nA war among the border people of England and Scotland went on for \ntwelve months, and then the Earl of Northumberland, the nobleman \nwho had helped Henry to the crown, began to rebel against him - \nprobably because nothing that Henry could do for him would satisfy \nhis extravagant expectations.  There was a certain Welsh gentleman, \nnamed OWEN GLENDOWER, who had been a student in one of the Inns of \nCourt, and had afterwards been in the service of the late King, \nwhose Welsh property was taken from him by a powerful lord related \nto the present King, who was his neighbour.  Appealing for redress, \nand getting none, he took up arms, was made an outlaw, and declared \nhimself sovereign of Wales.  He pretended to be a magician; and not \nonly were the Welsh people stupid enough to believe him, but, even \nHenry believed him too; for, making three expeditions into Wales, \nand being three times driven back by the wildness of the country, \nthe bad weather, and the skill of Glendower, he thought he was \ndefeated by the Welshman\'s magic arts.  However, he took Lord Grey \nand Sir Edmund Mortimer, prisoners, and allowed the relatives of \nLord Grey to ransom him, but would not extend such favour to Sir \nEdmund Mortimer.  Now, Henry Percy, called HOTSPUR, son of the Earl \nof Northumberland, who was married to Mortimer\'s sister, is \nsupposed to have taken offence at this; and, therefore, in \nconjunction with his father and some others, to have joined Owen \nGlendower, and risen against Henry.  It is by no means clear that \nthis was the real cause of the conspiracy; but perhaps it was made \nthe pretext.  It was formed, and was very powerful; including \nSCROOP, Archbishop of York, and the EARL OF DOUGLAS, a powerful and \nbrave Scottish nobleman.  The King was prompt and active, and the \ntwo armies met at Shrewsbury.\n\nThere were about fourteen thousand men in each.  The old Earl of \nNorthumberland being sick, the rebel forces were led by his son.  \nThe King wore plain armour to deceive the enemy; and four noblemen, \nwith the same object, wore the royal arms.  The rebel charge was so \nfurious, that every one of those gentlemen was killed, the royal \nstandard was beaten down, and the young Prince of Wales was \nseverely wounded in the face.  But he was one of the bravest and \nbest soldiers that ever lived, and he fought so well, and the \nKing\'s troops were so encouraged by his bold example, that they \nrallied immediately, and cut the enemy\'s forces all to pieces.  \nHotspur was killed by an arrow in the brain, and the rout was so \ncomplete that the whole rebellion was struck down by this one blow.  \nThe Earl of Northumberland surrendered himself soon after hearing \nof the death of his son, and received a pardon for all his \noffences.\n\nThere were some lingerings of rebellion yet:  Owen Glendower being \nretired to Wales, and a preposterous story being spread among the \nignorant people that King Richard was still alive.  How they could \nhave believed such nonsense it is difficult to imagine; but they \ncertainly did suppose that the Court fool of the late King, who was \nsomething like him, was he, himself; so that it seemed as if, after \ngiving so much trouble to the country in his life, he was still to \ntrouble it after his death.  This was not the worst.  The young \nEarl of March and his brother were stolen out of Windsor Castle.  \nBeing retaken, and being found to have been spirited away by one \nLady Spencer, she accused her own brother, that Earl of Rutland who \nwas in the former conspiracy and was now Duke of York, of being in \nthe plot.  For this he was ruined in fortune, though not put to \ndeath; and then another plot arose among the old Earl of \nNorthumberland, some other lords, and that same Scroop, Archbishop \nof York, who was with the rebels before.  These conspirators caused \na writing to be posted on the church doors, accusing the King of a \nvariety of crimes; but, the King being eager and vigilant to oppose \nthem, they were all taken, and the Archbishop was executed.  This \nwas the first time that a great churchman had been slain by the law \nin England; but the King was resolved that it should be done, and \ndone it was.\n\nThe next most remarkable event of this time was the seizure, by \nHenry, of the heir to the Scottish throne - James, a boy of nine \nyears old.  He had been put aboard-ship by his father, the Scottish \nKing Robert, to save him from the designs of his uncle, when, on \nhis way to France, he was accidentally taken by some English \ncruisers.  He remained a prisoner in England for nineteen years, \nand became in his prison a student and a famous poet.\n\nWith the exception of occasional troubles with the Welsh and with \nthe French, the rest of King Henry\'s reign was quiet enough.  But, \nthe King was far from happy, and probably was troubled in his \nconscience by knowing that he had usurped the crown, and had \noccasioned the death of his miserable cousin.  The Prince of Wales, \nthough brave and generous, is said to have been wild and \ndissipated, and even to have drawn his sword on GASCOIGNE, the \nChief Justice of the King\'s Bench, because he was firm in dealing \nimpartially with one of his dissolute companions.  Upon this the \nChief Justice is said to have ordered him immediately to prison; \nthe Prince of Wales is said to have submitted with a good grace; \nand the King is said to have exclaimed, \'Happy is the monarch who \nhas so just a judge, and a son so willing to obey the laws.\'  This \nis all very doubtful, and so is another story (of which Shakespeare \nhas made beautiful use), that the Prince once took the crown out of \nhis father\'s chamber as he was sleeping, and tried it on his own \nhead.\n\nThe King\'s health sank more and more, and he became subject to \nviolent eruptions on the face and to bad epileptic fits, and his \nspirits sank every day.  At last, as he was praying before the \nshrine of St. Edward at Westminster Abbey, he was seized with a \nterrible fit, and was carried into the Abbot\'s chamber, where he \npresently died.  It had been foretold that he would die at \nJerusalem, which certainly is not, and never was, Westminster.  \nBut, as the Abbot\'s room had long been called the Jerusalem \nchamber, people said it was all the same thing, and were quite \nsatisfied with the prediction.\n\nThe King died on the 20th of March, 1413, in the forty-seventh year \nof his age, and the fourteenth of his reign.  He was buried in \nCanterbury Cathedral.  He had been twice married, and had, by his \nfirst wife, a family of four sons and two daughters.  Considering \nhis duplicity before he came to the throne, his unjust seizure of \nit, and above all, his making that monstrous law for the burning of \nwhat the priests called heretics, he was a reasonably good king, as \nkings went.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIFTH\n\n\n\nFIRST PART\n\n\nTHE Prince of Wales began his reign like a generous and honest man.  \nHe set the young Earl of March free; he restored their estates and \ntheir honours to the Percy family, who had lost them by their \nrebellion against his father; he ordered the imbecile and \nunfortunate Richard to be honourably buried among the Kings of \nEngland; and he dismissed all his wild companions, with assurances \nthat they should not want, if they would resolve to be steady, \nfaithful, and true.\n\nIt is much easier to burn men than to burn their opinions; and \nthose of the Lollards were spreading every day.  The Lollards were \nrepresented by the priests - probably falsely for the most part - \nto entertain treasonable designs against the new King; and Henry, \nsuffering himself to be worked upon by these representations, \nsacrificed his friend Sir John Oldcastle, the Lord Cobham, to them, \nafter trying in vain to convert him by arguments.  He was declared \nguilty, as the head of the sect, and sentenced to the flames; but \nhe escaped from the Tower before the day of execution (postponed \nfor fifty days by the King himself), and summoned the Lollards to \nmeet him near London on a certain day.  So the priests told the \nKing, at least.  I doubt whether there was any conspiracy beyond \nsuch as was got up by their agents.  On the day appointed, instead \nof five-and-twenty thousand men, under the command of Sir John \nOldcastle, in the meadows of St. Giles, the King found only eighty \nmen, and no Sir John at all.  There was, in another place, an \naddle-headed brewer, who had gold trappings to his horses, and a \npair of gilt spurs in his breast - expecting to be made a knight \nnext day by Sir John, and so to gain the right to wear them - but \nthere was no Sir John, nor did anybody give information respecting \nhim, though the King offered great rewards for such intelligence.  \nThirty of these unfortunate Lollards were hanged and drawn \nimmediately, and were then burnt, gallows and all; and the various \nprisons in and around London were crammed full of others.  Some of \nthese unfortunate men made various confessions of treasonable \ndesigns; but, such confessions were easily got, under torture and \nthe fear of fire, and are very little to be trusted.  To finish the \nsad story of Sir John Oldcastle at once, I may mention that he \nescaped into Wales, and remained there safely, for four years.  \nWhen discovered by Lord Powis, it is very doubtful if he would have \nbeen taken alive - so great was the old soldier\'s bravery - if a \nmiserable old woman had not come behind him and broken his legs \nwith a stool.  He was carried to London in a horse-litter, was \nfastened by an iron chain to a gibbet, and so roasted to death.\n\nTo make the state of France as plain as I can in a few words, I \nshould tell you that the Duke of Orleans, and the Duke of Burgundy, \ncommonly called \'John without fear,\' had had a grand reconciliation \nof their quarrel in the last reign, and had appeared to be quite in \na heavenly state of mind.  Immediately after which, on a Sunday, in \nthe public streets of Paris, the Duke of Orleans was murdered by a \nparty of twenty men, set on by the Duke of Burgundy - according to \nhis own deliberate confession.  The widow of King Richard had been \nmarried in France to the eldest son of the Duke of Orleans.  The \npoor mad King was quite powerless to help her, and the Duke of \nBurgundy became the real master of France.  Isabella dying, her \nhusband (Duke of Orleans since the death of his father) married the \ndaughter of the Count of Armagnac, who, being a much abler man than \nhis young son-in-law, headed his party; thence called after him \nArmagnacs.  Thus, France was now in this terrible condition, that \nit had in it the party of the King\'s son, the Dauphin Louis; the \nparty of the Duke of Burgundy, who was the father of the Dauphin\'s \nill-used wife; and the party of the Armagnacs; all hating each \nother; all fighting together; all composed of the most depraved \nnobles that the earth has ever known; and all tearing unhappy \nFrance to pieces.\n\nThe late King had watched these dissensions from England, sensible \n(like the French people) that no enemy of France could injure her \nmore than her own nobility.  The present King now advanced a claim \nto the French throne.  His demand being, of course, refused, he \nreduced his proposal to a certain large amount of French territory, \nand to demanding the French princess, Catherine, in marriage, with \na fortune of two millions of golden crowns.  He was offered less \nterritory and fewer crowns, and no princess; but he called his \nambassadors home and prepared for war.  Then, he proposed to take \nthe princess with one million of crowns.  The French Court replied \nthat he should have the princess with two hundred thousand crowns \nless; he said this would not do (he had never seen the princess in \nhis life), and assembled his army at Southampton.  There was a \nshort plot at home just at that time, for deposing him, and making \nthe Earl of March king; but the conspirators were all speedily \ncondemned and executed, and the King embarked for France.\n\nIt is dreadful to observe how long a bad example will be followed; \nbut, it is encouraging to know that a good example is never thrown \naway.  The King\'s first act on disembarking at the mouth of the \nriver Seine, three miles from Harfleur, was to imitate his father, \nand to proclaim his solemn orders that the lives and property of \nthe peaceable inhabitants should be respected on pain of death.  It \nis agreed by French writers, to his lasting renown, that even while \nhis soldiers were suffering the greatest distress from want of \nfood, these commands were rigidly obeyed.\n\nWith an army in all of thirty thousand men, he besieged the town of \nHarfleur both by sea and land for five weeks; at the end of which \ntime the town surrendered, and the inhabitants were allowed to \ndepart with only fivepence each, and a part of their clothes.  All \nthe rest of their possessions was divided amongst the English army.  \nBut, that army suffered so much, in spite of its successes, from \ndisease and privation, that it was already reduced one half.  \nStill, the King was determined not to retire until he had struck a \ngreater blow.  Therefore, against the advice of all his \ncounsellors, he moved on with his little force towards Calais.  \nWhen he came up to the river Somme he was unable to cross, in \nconsequence of the fort being fortified; and, as the English moved \nup the left bank of the river looking for a crossing, the French, \nwho had broken all the bridges, moved up the right bank, watching \nthem, and waiting to attack them when they should try to pass it.  \nAt last the English found a crossing and got safely over.  The \nFrench held a council of war at Rouen, resolved to give the English \nbattle, and sent heralds to King Henry to know by which road he was \ngoing.  \'By the road that will take me straight to Calais!\' said \nthe King, and sent them away with a present of a hundred crowns.\n\nThe English moved on, until they beheld the French, and then the \nKing gave orders to form in line of battle.  The French not coming \non, the army broke up after remaining in battle array till night, \nand got good rest and refreshment at a neighbouring village.  The \nFrench were now all lying in another village, through which they \nknew the English must pass.  They were resolved that the English \nshould begin the battle.  The English had no means of retreat, if \ntheir King had any such intention; and so the two armies passed the \nnight, close together.\n\nTo understand these armies well, you must bear in mind that the \nimmense French army had, among its notable persons, almost the \nwhole of that wicked nobility, whose debauchery had made France a \ndesert; and so besotted were they by pride, and by contempt for the \ncommon people, that they had scarcely any bowmen (if indeed they \nhad any at all) in their whole enormous number:  which, compared \nwith the English army, was at least as six to one.  For these proud \nfools had said that the bow was not a fit weapon for knightly \nhands, and that France must be defended by gentlemen only.  We \nshall see, presently, what hand the gentlemen made of it.\n\nNow, on the English side, among the little force, there was a good \nproportion of men who were not gentlemen by any means, but who were \ngood stout archers for all that.  Among them, in the morning - \nhaving slept little at night, while the French were carousing and \nmaking sure of victory - the King rode, on a grey horse; wearing on \nhis head a helmet of shining steel, surmounted by a crown of gold, \nsparkling with precious stones; and bearing over his armour, \nembroidered together, the arms of England and the arms of France.  \nThe archers looked at the shining helmet and the crown of gold and \nthe sparkling jewels, and admired them all; but, what they admired \nmost was the King\'s cheerful face, and his bright blue eye, as he \ntold them that, for himself, he had made up his mind to conquer \nthere or to die there, and that England should never have a ransom \nto pay for HIM.  There was one brave knight who chanced to say that \nhe wished some of the many gallant gentlemen and good soldiers, who \nwere then idle at home in England, were there to increase their \nnumbers.  But the King told him that, for his part, he did not wish \nfor one more man.  \'The fewer we have,\' said he, \'the greater will \nbe the honour we shall win!\'  His men, being now all in good heart, \nwere refreshed with bread and wine, and heard prayers, and waited \nquietly for the French.  The King waited for the French, because \nthey were drawn up thirty deep (the little English force was only \nthree deep), on very difficult and heavy ground; and he knew that \nwhen they moved, there must be confusion among them.\n\nAs they did not move, he sent off two parties:- one to lie \nconcealed in a wood on the left of the French:  the other, to set \nfire to some houses behind the French after the battle should be \nbegun.  This was scarcely done, when three of the proud French \ngentlemen, who were to defend their country without any help from \nthe base peasants, came riding out, calling upon the English to \nsurrender.  The King warned those gentlemen himself to retire with \nall speed if they cared for their lives, and ordered the English \nbanners to advance.  Upon that, Sir Thomas Erpingham, a great \nEnglish general, who commanded the archers, threw his truncheon \ninto the air, joyfully, and all the English men, kneeling down upon \nthe ground and biting it as if they took possession of the country, \nrose up with a great shout and fell upon the French.\n\nEvery archer was furnished with a great stake tipped with iron; and \nhis orders were, to thrust this stake into the ground, to discharge \nhis arrow, and then to fall back, when the French horsemen came on.  \nAs the haughty French gentlemen, who were to break the English \narchers and utterly destroy them with their knightly lances, came \nriding up, they were received with such a blinding storm of arrows, \nthat they broke and turned.  Horses and men rolled over one \nanother, and the confusion was terrific.  Those who rallied and \ncharged the archers got among the stakes on slippery and boggy \nground, and were so bewildered that the English archers - who wore \nno armour, and even took off their leathern coats to be more active \n- cut them to pieces, root and branch.  Only three French horsemen \ngot within the stakes, and those were instantly despatched.  All \nthis time the dense French army, being in armour, were sinking \nknee-deep into the mire; while the light English archers, half-\nnaked, were as fresh and active as if they were fighting on a \nmarble floor.\n\nBut now, the second division of the French coming to the relief of \nthe first, closed up in a firm mass; the English, headed by the \nKing, attacked them; and the deadliest part of the battle began.  \nThe King\'s brother, the Duke of Clarence, was struck down, and \nnumbers of the French surrounded him; but, King Henry, standing \nover the body, fought like a lion until they were beaten off.\n\nPresently, came up a band of eighteen French knights, bearing the \nbanner of a certain French lord, who had sworn to kill or take the \nEnglish King.  One of them struck him such a blow with a battle-axe \nthat he reeled and fell upon his knees; but, his faithful men, \nimmediately closing round him, killed every one of those eighteen \nknights, and so that French lord never kept his oath.\n\nThe French Duke of Alenáon, seeing this, made a desperate charge, \nand cut his way close up to the Royal Standard of England.  He beat \ndown the Duke of York, who was standing near it; and, when the King \ncame to his rescue, struck off a piece of the crown he wore.  But, \nhe never struck another blow in this world; for, even as he was in \nthe act of saying who he was, and that he surrendered to the King; \nand even as the King stretched out his hand to give him a safe and \nhonourable acceptance of the offer; he fell dead, pierced by \ninnumerable wounds.\n\nThe death of this nobleman decided the battle.  The third division \nof the French army, which had never struck a blow yet, and which \nwas, in itself, more than double the whole English power, broke and \nfled.  At this time of the fight, the English, who as yet had made \nno prisoners, began to take them in immense numbers, and were still \noccupied in doing so, or in killing those who would not surrender, \nwhen a great noise arose in the rear of the French - their flying \nbanners were seen to stop - and King Henry, supposing a great \nreinforcement to have arrived, gave orders that all the prisoners \nshould be put to death.  As soon, however, as it was found that the \nnoise was only occasioned by a body of plundering peasants, the \nterrible massacre was stopped.\n\nThen King Henry called to him the French herald, and asked him to \nwhom the victory belonged.\n\nThe herald replied, \'To the King of England.\'\n\n\'WE have not made this havoc and slaughter,\' said the King.  \'It is \nthe wrath of Heaven on the sins of France.  What is the name of \nthat castle yonder?\'\n\nThe herald answered him, \'My lord, it is the castle of Azincourt.\'  \nSaid the King, \'From henceforth this battle shall be known to \nposterity, by the name of the battle of Azincourt.\'\n\nOur English historians have made it Agincourt; but, under that \nname, it will ever be famous in English annals.\n\nThe loss upon the French side was enormous.  Three Dukes were \nkilled, two more were taken prisoners, seven Counts were killed, \nthree more were taken prisoners, and ten thousand knights and \ngentlemen were slain upon the field.  The English loss amounted to \nsixteen hundred men, among whom were the Duke of York and the Earl \nof Suffolk.\n\nWar is a dreadful thing; and it is appalling to know how the \nEnglish were obliged, next morning, to kill those prisoners \nmortally wounded, who yet writhed in agony upon the ground; how the \ndead upon the French side were stripped by their own countrymen and \ncountrywomen, and afterwards buried in great pits; how the dead \nupon the English side were piled up in a great barn, and how their \nbodies and the barn were all burned together.  It is in such \nthings, and in many more much too horrible to relate, that the real \ndesolation and wickedness of war consist.  Nothing can make war \notherwise than horrible.  But the dark side of it was little \nthought of and soon forgotten; and it cast no shade of trouble on \nthe English people, except on those who had lost friends or \nrelations in the fight.  They welcomed their King home with shouts \nof rejoicing, and plunged into the water to bear him ashore on \ntheir shoulders, and flocked out in crowds to welcome him in every \ntown through which he passed, and hung rich carpets and tapestries \nout of the windows, and strewed the streets with flowers, and made \nthe fountains run with wine, as the great field of Agincourt had \nrun with blood.\n\n\nSECOND PART\n\n\nTHAT proud and wicked French nobility who dragged their country to \ndestruction, and who were every day and every year regarded with \ndeeper hatred and detestation in the hearts of the French people, \nlearnt nothing, even from the defeat of Agincourt.  So far from \nuniting against the common enemy, they became, among themselves, \nmore violent, more bloody, and more false - if that were possible - \nthan they had been before.  The Count of Armagnac persuaded the \nFrench king to plunder of her treasures Queen Isabella of Bavaria, \nand to make her a prisoner.  She, who had hitherto been the bitter \nenemy of the Duke of Burgundy, proposed to join him, in revenge.  \nHe carried her off to Troyes, where she proclaimed herself Regent \nof France, and made him her lieutenant.  The Armagnac party were at \nthat time possessed of Paris; but, one of the gates of the city \nbeing secretly opened on a certain night to a party of the duke\'s \nmen, they got into Paris, threw into the prisons all the Armagnacs \nupon whom they could lay their hands, and, a few nights afterwards, \nwith the aid of a furious mob of sixty thousand people, broke the \nprisons open, and killed them all.  The former Dauphin was now \ndead, and the King\'s third son bore the title.  Him, in the height \nof this murderous scene, a French knight hurried out of bed, \nwrapped in a sheet, and bore away to Poitiers.  So, when the \nrevengeful Isabella and the Duke of Burgundy entered Paris in \ntriumph after the slaughter of their enemies, the Dauphin was \nproclaimed at Poitiers as the real Regent.\n\nKing Henry had not been idle since his victory of Agincourt, but \nhad repulsed a brave attempt of the French to recover Harfleur; had \ngradually conquered a great part of Normandy; and, at this crisis \nof affairs, took the important town of Rouen, after a siege of half \na year.  This great loss so alarmed the French, that the Duke of \nBurgundy proposed that a meeting to treat of peace should be held \nbetween the French and the English kings in a plain by the river \nSeine.  On the appointed day, King Henry appeared there, with his \ntwo brothers, Clarence and Gloucester, and a thousand men.  The \nunfortunate French King, being more mad than usual that day, could \nnot come; but the Queen came, and with her the Princess Catherine:  \nwho was a very lovely creature, and who made a real impression on \nKing Henry, now that he saw her for the first time.  This was the \nmost important circumstance that arose out of the meeting.\n\nAs if it were impossible for a French nobleman of that time to be \ntrue to his word of honour in anything, Henry discovered that the \nDuke of Burgundy was, at that very moment, in secret treaty with \nthe Dauphin; and he therefore abandoned the negotiation.\n\nThe Duke of Burgundy and the Dauphin, each of whom with the best \nreason distrusted the other as a noble ruffian surrounded by a \nparty of noble ruffians, were rather at a loss how to proceed after \nthis; but, at length they agreed to meet, on a bridge over the \nriver Yonne, where it was arranged that there should be two strong \ngates put up, with an empty space between them; and that the Duke \nof Burgundy should come into that space by one gate, with ten men \nonly; and that the Dauphin should come into that space by the other \ngate, also with ten men, and no more.\n\nSo far the Dauphin kept his word, but no farther.  When the Duke of \nBurgundy was on his knee before him in the act of speaking, one of \nthe Dauphin\'s noble ruffians cut the said duke down with a small \naxe, and others speedily finished him.\n\nIt was in vain for the Dauphin to pretend that this base murder was \nnot done with his consent; it was too bad, even for France, and \ncaused a general horror.  The duke\'s heir hastened to make a treaty \nwith King Henry, and the French Queen engaged that her husband \nshould consent to it, whatever it was.  Henry made peace, on \ncondition of receiving the Princess Catherine in marriage, and \nbeing made Regent of France during the rest of the King\'s lifetime, \nand succeeding to the French crown at his death.  He was soon \nmarried to the beautiful Princess, and took her proudly home to \nEngland, where she was crowned with great honour and glory.\n\nThis peace was called the Perpetual Peace; we shall soon see how \nlong it lasted.  It gave great satisfaction to the French people, \nalthough they were so poor and miserable, that, at the time of the \ncelebration of the Royal marriage, numbers of them were dying with \nstarvation, on the dunghills in the streets of Paris.  There was \nsome resistance on the part of the Dauphin in some few parts of \nFrance, but King Henry beat it all down.\n\nAnd now, with his great possessions in France secured, and his \nbeautiful wife to cheer him, and a son born to give him greater \nhappiness, all appeared bright before him.  But, in the fulness of \nhis triumph and the height of his power, Death came upon him, and \nhis day was done.  When he fell ill at Vincennes, and found that he \ncould not recover, he was very calm and quiet, and spoke serenely \nto those who wept around his bed.  His wife and child, he said, he \nleft to the loving care of his brother the Duke of Bedford, and his \nother faithful nobles.  He gave them his advice that England should \nestablish a friendship with the new Duke of Burgundy, and offer him \nthe regency of France; that it should not set free the royal \nprinces who had been taken at Agincourt; and that, whatever quarrel \nmight arise with France, England should never make peace without \nholding Normandy.  Then, he laid down his head, and asked the \nattendant priests to chant the penitential psalms.  Amid which \nsolemn sounds, on the thirty-first of August, one thousand four \nhundred and twenty-two, in only the thirty-fourth year of his age \nand the tenth of his reign, King Henry the Fifth passed away.\n\nSlowly and mournfully they carried his embalmed body in a \nprocession of great state to Paris, and thence to Rouen where his \nQueen was:  from whom the sad intelligence of his death was \nconcealed until he had been dead some days.  Thence, lying on a bed \nof crimson and gold, with a golden crown upon the head, and a \ngolden ball and sceptre lying in the nerveless hands, they carried \nit to Calais, with such a great retinue as seemed to dye the road \nblack.  The King of Scotland acted as chief mourner, all the Royal \nHousehold followed, the knights wore black armour and black plumes \nof feathers, crowds of men bore torches, making the night as light \nas day; and the widowed Princess followed last of all.  At Calais \nthere was a fleet of ships to bring the funeral host to Dover.  And \nso, by way of London Bridge, where the service for the dead was \nchanted as it passed along, they brought the body to Westminster \nAbbey, and there buried it with great respect.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SIXTH\n\n\n\nPART THE FIRST\n\n\nIT had been the wish of the late King, that while his infant son \nKING HENRY THE SIXTH, at this time only nine months old, was under \nage, the Duke of Gloucester should be appointed Regent.  The \nEnglish Parliament, however, preferred to appoint a Council of \nRegency, with the Duke of Bedford at its head:  to be represented, \nin his absence only, by the Duke of Gloucester.  The Parliament \nwould seem to have been wise in this, for Gloucester soon showed \nhimself to be ambitious and troublesome, and, in the gratification \nof his own personal schemes, gave dangerous offence to the Duke of \nBurgundy, which was with difficulty adjusted.\n\nAs that duke declined the Regency of France, it was bestowed by the \npoor French King upon the Duke of Bedford.  But, the French King \ndying within two months, the Dauphin instantly asserted his claim \nto the French throne, and was actually crowned under the title of \nCHARLES THE SEVENTH.  The Duke of Bedford, to be a match for him, \nentered into a friendly league with the Dukes of Burgundy and \nBrittany, and gave them his two sisters in marriage.  War with \nFrance was immediately renewed, and the Perpetual Peace came to an \nuntimely end.\n\nIn the first campaign, the English, aided by this alliance, were \nspeedily successful.  As Scotland, however, had sent the French \nfive thousand men, and might send more, or attack the North of \nEngland while England was busy with France, it was considered that \nit would be a good thing to offer the Scottish King, James, who had \nbeen so long imprisoned, his liberty, on his paying forty thousand \npounds for his board and lodging during nineteen years, and \nengaging to forbid his subjects from serving under the flag of \nFrance.  It is pleasant to know, not only that the amiable captive \nat last regained his freedom upon these terms, but, that he married \na noble English lady, with whom he had been long in love, and \nbecame an excellent King.  I am afraid we have met with some Kings \nin this history, and shall meet with some more, who would have been \nvery much the better, and would have left the world much happier, \nif they had been imprisoned nineteen years too.\n\nIn the second campaign, the English gained a considerable victory \nat Verneuil, in a battle which was chiefly remarkable, otherwise, \nfor their resorting to the odd expedient of tying their baggage-\nhorses together by the heads and tails, and jumbling them up with \nthe baggage, so as to convert them into a sort of live \nfortification - which was found useful to the troops, but which I \nshould think was not agreeable to the horses.  For three years \nafterwards very little was done, owing to both sides being too poor \nfor war, which is a very expensive entertainment; but, a council \nwas then held in Paris, in which it was decided to lay siege to the \ntown of Orleans, which was a place of great importance to the \nDauphin\'s cause.  An English army of ten thousand men was \ndespatched on this service, under the command of the Earl of \nSalisbury, a general of fame.  He being unfortunately killed early \nin the siege, the Earl of Suffolk took his place; under whom \n(reinforced by SIR JOHN FALSTAFF, who brought up four hundred \nwaggons laden with salt herrings and other provisions for the \ntroops, and, beating off the French who tried to intercept him, \ncame victorious out of a hot skirmish, which was afterwards called \nin jest the Battle of the Herrings) the town of Orleans was so \ncompletely hemmed in, that the besieged proposed to yield it up to \ntheir countryman the Duke of Burgundy.  The English general, \nhowever, replied that his English men had won it, so far, by their \nblood and valour, and that his English men must have it.  There \nseemed to be no hope for the town, or for the Dauphin, who was so \ndismayed that he even thought of flying to Scotland or to Spain - \nwhen a peasant girl rose up and changed the whole state of affairs.\n\nThe story of this peasant girl I have now to tell.\n\n\nPART THE SECOND:  THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC\n\n\nIN a remote village among some wild hills in the province of \nLorraine, there lived a countryman whose name was JACQUES D\'ARC.  \nHe had a daughter, JOAN OF ARC, who was at this time in her \ntwentieth year.  She had been a solitary girl from her childhood; \nshe had often tended sheep and cattle for whole days where no human \nfigure was seen or human voice heard; and she had often knelt, for \nhours together, in the gloomy, empty, little village chapel, \nlooking up at the altar and at the dim lamp burning before it, \nuntil she fancied that she saw shadowy figures standing there, and \neven that she heard them speak to her.  The people in that part of \nFrance were very ignorant and superstitious, and they had many \nghostly tales to tell about what they had dreamed, and what they \nsaw among the lonely hills when the clouds and the mists were \nresting on them.  So, they easily believed that Joan saw strange \nsights, and they whispered among themselves that angels and spirits \ntalked to her.\n\nAt last, Joan told her father that she had one day been surprised \nby a great unearthly light, and had afterwards heard a solemn \nvoice, which said it was Saint Michael\'s voice, telling her that \nshe was to go and help the Dauphin.  Soon after this (she said), \nSaint Catherine and Saint Margaret had appeared to her with \nsparkling crowns upon their heads, and had encouraged her to be \nvirtuous and resolute.  These visions had returned sometimes; but \nthe Voices very often; and the voices always said, \'Joan, thou art \nappointed by Heaven to go and help the Dauphin!\'  She almost always \nheard them while the chapel bells were ringing.\n\nThere is no doubt, now, that Joan believed she saw and heard these \nthings.  It is very well known that such delusions are a disease \nwhich is not by any means uncommon.  It is probable enough that \nthere were figures of Saint Michael, and Saint Catherine, and Saint \nMargaret, in the little chapel (where they would be very likely to \nhave shining crowns upon their heads), and that they first gave \nJoan the idea of those three personages.  She had long been a \nmoping, fanciful girl, and, though she was a very good girl, I dare \nsay she was a little vain, and wishful for notoriety.\n\nHer father, something wiser than his neighbours, said, \'I tell \nthee, Joan, it is thy fancy.  Thou hadst better have a kind husband \nto take care of thee, girl, and work to employ thy mind!\'  But Joan \ntold him in reply, that she had taken a vow never to have a \nhusband, and that she must go as Heaven directed her, to help the \nDauphin.\n\nIt happened, unfortunately for her father\'s persuasions, and most \nunfortunately for the poor girl, too, that a party of the Dauphin\'s \nenemies found their way into the village while Joan\'s disorder was \nat this point, and burnt the chapel, and drove out the inhabitants.  \nThe cruelties she saw committed, touched Joan\'s heart and made her \nworse.  She said that the voices and the figures were now \ncontinually with her; that they told her she was the girl who, \naccording to an old prophecy, was to deliver France; and she must \ngo and help the Dauphin, and must remain with him until he should \nbe crowned at Rheims:  and that she must travel a long way to a \ncertain lord named BAUDRICOURT, who could and would, bring her into \nthe Dauphin\'s presence.\n\nAs her father still said, \'I tell thee, Joan, it is thy fancy,\' she \nset off to find out this lord, accompanied by an uncle, a poor \nvillage wheelwright and cart-maker, who believed in the reality of \nher visions.  They travelled a long way and went on and on, over a \nrough country, full of the Duke of Burgundy\'s men, and of all kinds \nof robbers and marauders, until they came to where this lord was.\n\nWhen his servants told him that there was a poor peasant girl named \nJoan of Arc, accompanied by nobody but an old village wheelwright \nand cart-maker, who wished to see him because she was commanded to \nhelp the Dauphin and save France, Baudricourt burst out a-laughing, \nand bade them send the girl away.  But, he soon heard so much about \nher lingering in the town, and praying in the churches, and seeing \nvisions, and doing harm to no one, that he sent for her, and \nquestioned her.  As she said the same things after she had been \nwell sprinkled with holy water as she had said before the \nsprinkling, Baudricourt began to think there might be something in \nit.  At all events, he thought it worth while to send her on to the \ntown of Chinon, where the Dauphin was.  So, he bought her a horse, \nand a sword, and gave her two squires to conduct her.  As the \nVoices had told Joan that she was to wear a man\'s dress, now, she \nput one on, and girded her sword to her side, and bound spurs to \nher heels, and mounted her horse and rode away with her two \nsquires.  As to her uncle the wheelwright, he stood staring at his \nniece in wonder until she was out of sight - as well he might - and \nthen went home again.  The best place, too.\n\nJoan and her two squires rode on and on, until they came to Chinon, \nwhere she was, after some doubt, admitted into the Dauphin\'s \npresence.  Picking him out immediately from all his court, she told \nhim that she came commanded by Heaven to subdue his enemies and \nconduct him to his coronation at Rheims.  She also told him (or he \npretended so afterwards, to make the greater impression upon his \nsoldiers) a number of his secrets known only to himself, and, \nfurthermore, she said there was an old, old sword in the cathedral \nof Saint Catherine at Fierbois, marked with five old crosses on the \nblade, which Saint Catherine had ordered her to wear.\n\nNow, nobody knew anything about this old, old sword, but when the \ncathedral came to be examined - which was immediately done - there, \nsure enough, the sword was found!  The Dauphin then required a \nnumber of grave priests and bishops to give him their opinion \nwhether the girl derived her power from good spirits or from evil \nspirits, which they held prodigiously long debates about, in the \ncourse of which several learned men fell fast asleep and snored \nloudly.  At last, when one gruff old gentleman had said to Joan, \n\'What language do your Voices speak?\' and when Joan had replied to \nthe gruff old gentleman, \'A pleasanter language than yours,\' they \nagreed that it was all correct, and that Joan of Arc was inspired \nfrom Heaven.  This wonderful circumstance put new heart into the \nDauphin\'s soldiers when they heard of it, and dispirited the \nEnglish army, who took Joan for a witch.\n\nSo Joan mounted horse again, and again rode on and on, until she \ncame to Orleans.  But she rode now, as never peasant girl had \nridden yet.  She rode upon a white war-horse, in a suit of \nglittering armour; with the old, old sword from the cathedral, \nnewly burnished, in her belt; with a white flag carried before her, \nupon which were a picture of God, and the words JESUS MARIA.  In \nthis splendid state, at the head of a great body of troops \nescorting provisions of all kinds for the starving inhabitants of \nOrleans, she appeared before that beleaguered city.\n\nWhen the people on the walls beheld her, they cried out \'The Maid \nis come!  The Maid of the Prophecy is come to deliver us!\'  And \nthis, and the sight of the Maid fighting at the head of their men, \nmade the French so bold, and made the English so fearful, that the \nEnglish line of forts was soon broken, the troops and provisions \nwere got into the town, and Orleans was saved.\n\nJoan, henceforth called THE MAID OF ORLEANS, remained within the \nwalls for a few days, and caused letters to be thrown over, \nordering Lord Suffolk and his Englishmen to depart from before the \ntown according to the will of Heaven.  As the English general very \npositively declined to believe that Joan knew anything about the \nwill of Heaven (which did not mend the matter with his soldiers, \nfor they stupidly said if she were not inspired she was a witch, \nand it was of no use to fight against a witch), she mounted her \nwhite war-horse again, and ordered her white banner to advance.\n\nThe besiegers held the bridge, and some strong towers upon the \nbridge; and here the Maid of Orleans attacked them.  The fight was \nfourteen hours long.  She planted a scaling ladder with her own \nhands, and mounted a tower wall, but was struck by an English arrow \nin the neck, and fell into the trench.  She was carried away and \nthe arrow was taken out, during which operation she screamed and \ncried with the pain, as any other girl might have done; but \npresently she said that the Voices were speaking to her and \nsoothing her to rest.  After a while, she got up, and was again \nforemost in the fight.  When the English who had seen her fall and \nsupposed her dead, saw this, they were troubled with the strangest \nfears, and some of them cried out that they beheld Saint Michael on \na white horse (probably Joan herself) fighting for the French.  \nThey lost the bridge, and lost the towers, and next day set their \nchain of forts on fire, and left the place.\n\nBut as Lord Suffolk himself retired no farther than the town of \nJargeau, which was only a few miles off, the Maid of Orleans \nbesieged him there, and he was taken prisoner.  As the white banner \nscaled the wall, she was struck upon the head with a stone, and was \nagain tumbled down into the ditch; but, she only cried all the \nmore, as she lay there, \'On, on, my countrymen!  And fear nothing, \nfor the Lord hath delivered them into our hands!\'  After this new \nsuccess of the Maid\'s, several other fortresses and places which \nhad previously held out against the Dauphin were delivered up \nwithout a battle; and at Patay she defeated the remainder of the \nEnglish army, and set up her victorious white banner on a field \nwhere twelve hundred Englishmen lay dead.\n\nShe now urged the Dauphin (who always kept out of the way when \nthere was any fighting) to proceed to Rheims, as the first part of \nher mission was accomplished; and to complete the whole by being \ncrowned there.  The Dauphin was in no particular hurry to do this, \nas Rheims was a long way off, and the English and the Duke of \nBurgundy were still strong in the country through which the road \nlay.  However, they set forth, with ten thousand men, and again the \nMaid of Orleans rode on and on, upon her white war-horse, and in \nher shining armour.  Whenever they came to a town which yielded \nreadily, the soldiers believed in her; but, whenever they came to a \ntown which gave them any trouble, they began to murmur that she was \nan impostor.  The latter was particularly the case at Troyes, which \nfinally yielded, however, through the persuasion of one Richard, a \nfriar of the place.  Friar Richard was in the old doubt about the \nMaid of Orleans, until he had sprinkled her well with holy water, \nand had also well sprinkled the threshold of the gate by which she \ncame into the city.  Finding that it made no change in her or the \ngate, he said, as the other grave old gentlemen had said, that it \nwas all right, and became her great ally.\n\nSo, at last, by dint of riding on and on, the Maid of Orleans, and \nthe Dauphin, and the ten thousand sometimes believing and sometimes \nunbelieving men, came to Rheims.  And in the great cathedral of \nRheims, the Dauphin actually was crowned Charles the Seventh in a \ngreat assembly of the people.  Then, the Maid, who with her white \nbanner stood beside the King in that hour of his triumph, kneeled \ndown upon the pavement at his feet, and said, with tears, that what \nshe had been inspired to do, was done, and that the only recompense \nshe asked for, was, that she should now have leave to go back to \nher distant home, and her sturdily incredulous father, and her \nfirst simple escort the village wheelwright and cart-maker.  But \nthe King said \'No!\' and made her and her family as noble as a King \ncould, and settled upon her the income of a Count.\n\nAh! happy had it been for the Maid of Orleans, if she had resumed \nher rustic dress that day, and had gone home to the little chapel \nand the wild hills, and had forgotten all these things, and had \nbeen a good man\'s wife, and had heard no stranger voices than the \nvoices of little children!\n\nIt was not to be, and she continued helping the King (she did a \nworld for him, in alliance with Friar Richard), and trying to \nimprove the lives of the coarse soldiers, and leading a religious, \nan unselfish, and a modest life, herself, beyond any doubt.  Still, \nmany times she prayed the King to let her go home; and once she \neven took off her bright armour and hung it up in a church, meaning \nnever to wear it more.  But, the King always won her back again - \nwhile she was of any use to him - and so she went on and on and on, \nto her doom.\n\nWhen the Duke of Bedford, who was a very able man, began to be \nactive for England, and, by bringing the war back into France and \nby holding the Duke of Burgundy to his faith, to distress and \ndisturb Charles very much, Charles sometimes asked the Maid of \nOrleans what the Voices said about it?  But, the Voices had become \n(very like ordinary voices in perplexed times) contradictory and \nconfused, so that now they said one thing, and now said another, \nand the Maid lost credit every day.  Charles marched on Paris, \nwhich was opposed to him, and attacked the suburb of Saint Honore.  \nIn this fight, being again struck down into the ditch, she was \nabandoned by the whole army.  She lay unaided among a heap of dead, \nand crawled out how she could.  Then, some of her believers went \nover to an opposition Maid, Catherine of La Rochelle, who said she \nwas inspired to tell where there were treasures of buried money - \nthough she never did - and then Joan accidentally broke the old, \nold sword, and others said that her power was broken with it.  \nFinally, at the siege of Compiägne, held by the Duke of Burgundy, \nwhere she did valiant service, she was basely left alone in a \nretreat, though facing about and fighting to the last; and an \narcher pulled her off her horse.\n\nO the uproar that was made, and the thanksgivings that were sung, \nabout the capture of this one poor country-girl!  O the way in \nwhich she was demanded to be tried for sorcery and heresy, and \nanything else you like, by the Inquisitor-General of France, and by \nthis great man, and by that great man, until it is wearisome to \nthink of! She was bought at last by the Bishop of Beauvais for ten \nthousand francs, and was shut up in her narrow prison:  plain Joan \nof Arc again, and Maid of Orleans no more.\n\nI should never have done if I were to tell you how they had Joan \nout to examine her, and cross-examine her, and re-examine her, and \nworry her into saying anything and everything; and how all sorts of \nscholars and doctors bestowed their utmost tediousness upon her.  \nSixteen times she was brought out and shut up again, and worried, \nand entrapped, and argued with, until she was heart-sick of the \ndreary business.  On the last occasion of this kind she was brought \ninto a burial-place at Rouen, dismally decorated with a scaffold, \nand a stake and faggots, and the executioner, and a pulpit with a \nfriar therein, and an awful sermon ready.  It is very affecting to \nknow that even at that pass the poor girl honoured the mean vermin \nof a King, who had so used her for his purposes and so abandoned \nher; and, that while she had been regardless of reproaches heaped \nupon herself, she spoke out courageously for him.\n\nIt was natural in one so young to hold to life.  To save her life, \nshe signed a declaration prepared for her - signed it with a cross, \nfor she couldn\'t write - that all her visions and Voices had come \nfrom the Devil.  Upon her recanting the past, and protesting that \nshe would never wear a man\'s dress in future, she was condemned to \nimprisonment for life, \'on the bread of sorrow and the water of \naffliction.\'\n\nBut, on the bread of sorrow and the water of affliction, the \nvisions and the Voices soon returned.  It was quite natural that \nthey should do so, for that kind of disease is much aggravated by \nfasting, loneliness, and anxiety of mind.  It was not only got out \nof Joan that she considered herself inspired again, but, she was \ntaken in a man\'s dress, which had been left - to entrap her - in \nher prison, and which she put on, in her solitude; perhaps, in \nremembrance of her past glories, perhaps, because the imaginary \nVoices told her.  For this relapse into the sorcery and heresy and \nanything else you like, she was sentenced to be burnt to death.  \nAnd, in the market-place of Rouen, in the hideous dress which the \nmonks had invented for such spectacles; with priests and bishops \nsitting in a gallery looking on, though some had the Christian \ngrace to go away, unable to endure the infamous scene; this \nshrieking girl - last seen amidst the smoke and fire, holding a \ncrucifix between her hands; last heard, calling upon Christ - was \nburnt to ashes.  They threw her ashes into the river Seine; but \nthey will rise against her murderers on the last day.\n\nFrom the moment of her capture, neither the French King nor one \nsingle man in all his court raised a finger to save her.  It is no \ndefence of them that they may have never really believed in her, or \nthat they may have won her victories by their skill and bravery.  \nThe more they pretended to believe in her, the more they had caused \nher to believe in herself; and she had ever been true to them, ever \nbrave, ever nobly devoted.  But, it is no wonder, that they, who \nwere in all things false to themselves, false to one another, false \nto their country, false to Heaven, false to Earth, should be \nmonsters of ingratitude and treachery to a helpless peasant girl.\n\nIn the picturesque old town of Rouen, where weeds and grass grow \nhigh on the cathedral towers, and the venerable Norman streets are \nstill warm in the blessed sunlight though the monkish fires that \nonce gleamed horribly upon them have long grown cold, there is a \nstatue of Joan of Arc, in the scene of her last agony, the square \nto which she has given its present name.  I know some statues of \nmodern times - even in the World\'s metropolis, I think - which \ncommemorate less constancy, less earnestness, smaller claims upon \nthe world\'s attention, and much greater impostors.\n\n\nPART THE THIRD\n\n\nBAD deeds seldom prosper, happily for mankind; and the English \ncause gained no advantage from the cruel death of Joan of Arc.  For \na long time, the war went heavily on.  The Duke of Bedford died; \nthe alliance with the Duke of Burgundy was broken; and Lord Talbot \nbecame a great general on the English side in France.  But, two of \nthe consequences of wars are, Famine - because the people cannot \npeacefully cultivate the ground - and Pestilence, which comes of \nwant, misery, and suffering.  Both these horrors broke out in both \ncountries, and lasted for two wretched years.  Then, the war went \non again, and came by slow degrees to be so badly conducted by the \nEnglish government, that, within twenty years from the execution of \nthe Maid of Orleans, of all the great French conquests, the town of \nCalais alone remained in English hands.\n\nWhile these victories and defeats were taking place in the course \nof time, many strange things happened at home.  The young King, as \nhe grew up, proved to be very unlike his great father, and showed \nhimself a miserable puny creature.  There was no harm in him - he \nhad a great aversion to shedding blood:  which was something - but, \nhe was a weak, silly, helpless young man, and a mere shuttlecock to \nthe great lordly battledores about the Court.\n\nOf these battledores, Cardinal Beaufort, a relation of the King, \nand the Duke of Gloucester, were at first the most powerful.  The \nDuke of Gloucester had a wife, who was nonsensically accused of \npractising witchcraft to cause the King\'s death and lead to her \nhusband\'s coming to the throne, he being the next heir.  She was \ncharged with having, by the help of a ridiculous old woman named \nMargery (who was called a witch), made a little waxen doll in the \nKing\'s likeness, and put it before a slow fire that it might \ngradually melt away.  It was supposed, in such cases, that the \ndeath of the person whom the doll was made to represent, was sure \nto happen.  Whether the duchess was as ignorant as the rest of \nthem, and really did make such a doll with such an intention, I \ndon\'t know; but, you and I know very well that she might have made \na thousand dolls, if she had been stupid enough, and might have \nmelted them all, without hurting the King or anybody else.  \nHowever, she was tried for it, and so was old Margery, and so was \none of the duke\'s chaplains, who was charged with having assisted \nthem.  Both he and Margery were put to death, and the duchess, \nafter being taken on foot and bearing a lighted candle, three times \nround the City, as a penance, was imprisoned for life.  The duke, \nhimself, took all this pretty quietly, and made as little stir \nabout the matter as if he were rather glad to be rid of the \nduchess.\n\nBut, he was not destined to keep himself out of trouble long.  The \nroyal shuttlecock being three-and-twenty, the battledores were very \nanxious to get him married.  The Duke of Gloucester wanted him to \nmarry a daughter of the Count of Armagnac; but, the Cardinal and \nthe Earl of Suffolk were all for MARGARET, the daughter of the King \nof Sicily, who they knew was a resolute, ambitious woman and would \ngovern the King as she chose.  To make friends with this lady, the \nEarl of Suffolk, who went over to arrange the match, consented to \naccept her for the King\'s wife without any fortune, and even to \ngive up the two most valuable possessions England then had in \nFrance.  So, the marriage was arranged, on terms very advantageous \nto the lady; and Lord Suffolk brought her to England, and she was \nmarried at Westminster.  On what pretence this queen and her party \ncharged the Duke of Gloucester with high treason within a couple of \nyears, it is impossible to make out, the matter is so confused; \nbut, they pretended that the King\'s life was in danger, and they \ntook the duke prisoner.  A fortnight afterwards, he was found dead \nin bed (they said), and his body was shown to the people, and Lord \nSuffolk came in for the best part of his estates.  You know by this \ntime how strangely liable state prisoners were to sudden death.\n\nIf Cardinal Beaufort had any hand in this matter, it did him no \ngood, for he died within six weeks; thinking it very hard and \ncurious - at eighty years old! - that he could not live to be Pope.\n\nThis was the time when England had completed her loss of all her \ngreat French conquests.  The people charged the loss principally \nupon the Earl of Suffolk, now a duke, who had made those easy terms \nabout the Royal Marriage, and who, they believed, had even been \nbought by France.  So he was impeached as a traitor, on a great \nnumber of charges, but chiefly on accusations of having aided the \nFrench King, and of designing to make his own son King of England.  \nThe Commons and the people being violent against him, the King was \nmade (by his friends) to interpose to save him, by banishing him \nfor five years, and proroguing the Parliament.  The duke had much \nado to escape from a London mob, two thousand strong, who lay in \nwait for him in St. Giles\'s fields; but, he got down to his own \nestates in Suffolk, and sailed away from Ipswich.  Sailing across \nthe Channel, he sent into Calais to know if he might land there; \nbut, they kept his boat and men in the harbour, until an English \nship, carrying a hundred and fifty men and called the Nicholas of \nthe Tower, came alongside his little vessel, and ordered him on \nboard.  \'Welcome, traitor, as men say,\' was the captain\'s grim and \nnot very respectful salutation.  He was kept on board, a prisoner, \nfor eight-and-forty hours, and then a small boat appeared rowing \ntoward the ship.  As this boat came nearer, it was seen to have in \nit a block, a rusty sword, and an executioner in a black mask.  The \nduke was handed down into it, and there his head was cut off with \nsix strokes of the rusty sword.  Then, the little boat rowed away \nto Dover beach, where the body was cast out, and left until the \nduchess claimed it.  By whom, high in authority, this murder was \ncommitted, has never appeared.  No one was ever punished for it.\n\nThere now arose in Kent an Irishman, who gave himself the name of \nMortimer, but whose real name was JACK CADE.  Jack, in imitation of \nWat Tyler, though he was a very different and inferior sort of man, \naddressed the Kentish men upon their wrongs, occasioned by the bad \ngovernment of England, among so many battledores and such a poor \nshuttlecock; and the Kentish men rose up to the number of twenty \nthousand.  Their place of assembly was Blackheath, where, headed by \nJack, they put forth two papers, which they called \'The Complaint \nof the Commons of Kent,\' and \'The Requests of the Captain of the \nGreat Assembly in Kent.\'  They then retired to Sevenoaks.  The \nroyal army coming up with them here, they beat it and killed their \ngeneral.  Then, Jack dressed himself in the dead general\'s armour, \nand led his men to London.\n\nJack passed into the City from Southwark, over the bridge, and \nentered it in triumph, giving the strictest orders to his men not \nto plunder.  Having made a show of his forces there, while the \ncitizens looked on quietly, he went back into Southwark in good \norder, and passed the night.  Next day, he came back again, having \ngot hold in the meantime of Lord Say, an unpopular nobleman.  Says \nJack to the Lord Mayor and judges:  \'Will you be so good as to make \na tribunal in Guildhall, and try me this nobleman?\'  The court \nbeing hastily made, he was found guilty, and Jack and his men cut \nhis head off on Cornhill.  They also cut off the head of his son-\nin-law, and then went back in good order to Southwark again.\n\nBut, although the citizens could bear the beheading of an unpopular \nlord, they could not bear to have their houses pillaged.  And it \ndid so happen that Jack, after dinner - perhaps he had drunk a \nlittle too much - began to plunder the house where he lodged; upon \nwhich, of course, his men began to imitate him.  Wherefore, the \nLondoners took counsel with Lord Scales, who had a thousand \nsoldiers in the Tower; and defended London Bridge, and kept Jack \nand his people out.  This advantage gained, it was resolved by \ndivers great men to divide Jack\'s army in the old way, by making a \ngreat many promises on behalf of the state, that were never \nintended to be performed.  This DID divide them; some of Jack\'s men \nsaying that they ought to take the conditions which were offered, \nand others saying that they ought not, for they were only a snare; \nsome going home at once; others staying where they were; and all \ndoubting and quarrelling among themselves.\n\nJack, who was in two minds about fighting or accepting a pardon, \nand who indeed did both, saw at last that there was nothing to \nexpect from his men, and that it was very likely some of them would \ndeliver him up and get a reward of a thousand marks, which was \noffered for his apprehension.  So, after they had travelled and \nquarrelled all the way from Southwark to Blackheath, and from \nBlackheath to Rochester, he mounted a good horse and galloped away \ninto Sussex.  But, there galloped after him, on a better horse, one \nAlexander Iden, who came up with him, had a hard fight with him, \nand killed him.  Jack\'s head was set aloft on London Bridge, with \nthe face looking towards Blackheath, where he had raised his flag; \nand Alexander Iden got the thousand marks.\n\nIt is supposed by some, that the Duke of York, who had been removed \nfrom a high post abroad through the Queen\'s influence, and sent out \nof the way, to govern Ireland, was at the bottom of this rising of \nJack and his men, because he wanted to trouble the government.  He \nclaimed (though not yet publicly) to have a better right to the \nthrone than Henry of Lancaster, as one of the family of the Earl of \nMarch, whom Henry the Fourth had set aside.  Touching this claim, \nwhich, being through female relationship, was not according to the \nusual descent, it is enough to say that Henry the Fourth was the \nfree choice of the people and the Parliament, and that his family \nhad now reigned undisputed for sixty years.  The memory of Henry \nthe Fifth was so famous, and the English people loved it so much, \nthat the Duke of York\'s claim would, perhaps, never have been \nthought of (it would have been so hopeless) but for the unfortunate \ncircumstance of the present King\'s being by this time quite an \nidiot, and the country very ill governed.  These two circumstances \ngave the Duke of York a power he could not otherwise have had.\n\nWhether the Duke knew anything of Jack Cade, or not, he came over \nfrom Ireland while Jack\'s head was on London Bridge; being secretly \nadvised that the Queen was setting up his enemy, the Duke of \nSomerset, against him.  He went to Westminster, at the head of four \nthousand men, and on his knees before the King, represented to him \nthe bad state of the country, and petitioned him to summon a \nParliament to consider it.  This the King promised.  When the \nParliament was summoned, the Duke of York accused the Duke of \nSomerset, and the Duke of Somerset accused the Duke of York; and, \nboth in and out of Parliament, the followers of each party were \nfull of violence and hatred towards the other.  At length the Duke \nof York put himself at the head of a large force of his tenants, \nand, in arms, demanded the reformation of the Government.  Being \nshut out of London, he encamped at Dartford, and the royal army \nencamped at Blackheath.  According as either side triumphed, the \nDuke of York was arrested, or the Duke of Somerset was arrested.  \nThe trouble ended, for the moment, in the Duke of York renewing his \noath of allegiance, and going in peace to one of his own castles.\n\nHalf a year afterwards the Queen gave birth to a son, who was very \nill received by the people, and not believed to be the son of the \nKing.  It shows the Duke of York to have been a moderate man, \nunwilling to involve England in new troubles, that he did not take \nadvantage of the general discontent at this time, but really acted \nfor the public good.  He was made a member of the cabinet, and the \nKing being now so much worse that he could not be carried about and \nshown to the people with any decency, the duke was made Lord \nProtector of the kingdom, until the King should recover, or the \nPrince should come of age.  At the same time the Duke of Somerset \nwas committed to the Tower.  So, now the Duke of Somerset was down, \nand the Duke of York was up.  By the end of the year, however, the \nKing recovered his memory and some spark of sense; upon which the \nQueen used her power - which recovered with him - to get the \nProtector disgraced, and her favourite released.  So now the Duke \nof York was down, and the Duke of Somerset was up.\n\nThese ducal ups and downs gradually separated the whole nation into \nthe two parties of York and Lancaster, and led to those terrible \ncivil wars long known as the Wars of the Red and White Roses, \nbecause the red rose was the badge of the House of Lancaster, and \nthe white rose was the badge of the House of York.\n\nThe Duke of York, joined by some other powerful noblemen of the \nWhite Rose party, and leading a small army, met the King with \nanother small army at St. Alban\'s, and demanded that the Duke of \nSomerset should be given up.  The poor King, being made to say in \nanswer that he would sooner die, was instantly attacked.  The Duke \nof Somerset was killed, and the King himself was wounded in the \nneck, and took refuge in the house of a poor tanner.  Whereupon, \nthe Duke of York went to him, led him with great submission to the \nAbbey, and said he was very sorry for what had happened.  Having \nnow the King in his possession, he got a Parliament summoned and \nhimself once more made Protector, but, only for a few months; for, \non the King getting a little better again, the Queen and her party \ngot him into their possession, and disgraced the Duke once more.  \nSo, now the Duke of York was down again.\n\nSome of the best men in power, seeing the danger of these constant \nchanges, tried even then to prevent the Red and the White Rose \nWars.  They brought about a great council in London between the two \nparties.  The White Roses assembled in Blackfriars, the Red Roses \nin Whitefriars; and some good priests communicated between them, \nand made the proceedings known at evening to the King and the \njudges.  They ended in a peaceful agreement that there should be no \nmore quarrelling; and there was a great royal procession to St. \nPaul\'s, in which the Queen walked arm-in-arm with her old enemy, \nthe Duke of York, to show the people how comfortable they all were.  \nThis state of peace lasted half a year, when a dispute between the \nEarl of Warwick (one of the Duke\'s powerful friends) and some of \nthe King\'s servants at Court, led to an attack upon that Earl - who \nwas a White Rose - and to a sudden breaking out of all old \nanimosities.  So, here were greater ups and downs than ever.\n\nThere were even greater ups and downs than these, soon after.  \nAfter various battles, the Duke of York fled to Ireland, and his \nson the Earl of March to Calais, with their friends the Earls of \nSalisbury and Warwick; and a Parliament was held declaring them all \ntraitors.  Little the worse for this, the Earl of Warwick presently \ncame back, landed in Kent, was joined by the Archbishop of \nCanterbury and other powerful noblemen and gentlemen, engaged the \nKing\'s forces at Northampton, signally defeated them, and took the \nKing himself prisoner, who was found in his tent.  Warwick would \nhave been glad, I dare say, to have taken the Queen and Prince too, \nbut they escaped into Wales and thence into Scotland.\n\nThe King was carried by the victorious force straight to London, \nand made to call a new Parliament, which immediately declared that \nthe Duke of York and those other noblemen were not traitors, but \nexcellent subjects.  Then, back comes the Duke from Ireland at the \nhead of five hundred horsemen, rides from London to Westminster, \nand enters the House of Lords.  There, he laid his hand upon the \ncloth of gold which covered the empty throne, as if he had half a \nmind to sit down in it - but he did not.  On the Archbishop of \nCanterbury, asking him if he would visit the King, who was in his \npalace close by, he replied, \'I know no one in this country, my \nlord, who ought not to visit ME.\'  None of the lords present spoke \na single word; so, the duke went out as he had come in, established \nhimself royally in the King\'s palace, and, six days afterwards, \nsent in to the Lords a formal statement of his claim to the throne.  \nThe lords went to the King on this momentous subject, and after a \ngreat deal of discussion, in which the judges and the other law \nofficers were afraid to give an opinion on either side, the \nquestion was compromised.  It was agreed that the present King \nshould retain the crown for his life, and that it should then pass \nto the Duke of York and his heirs.\n\nBut, the resolute Queen, determined on asserting her son\'s right, \nwould hear of no such thing.  She came from Scotland to the north \nof England, where several powerful lords armed in her cause.  The \nDuke of York, for his part, set off with some five thousand men, a \nlittle time before Christmas Day, one thousand four hundred and \nsixty, to give her battle.  He lodged at Sandal Castle, near \nWakefield, and the Red Roses defied him to come out on Wakefield \nGreen, and fight them then and there.  His generals said, he had \nbest wait until his gallant son, the Earl of March, came up with \nhis power; but, he was determined to accept the challenge.  He did \nso, in an evil hour.  He was hotly pressed on all sides, two \nthousand of his men lay dead on Wakefield Green, and he himself was \ntaken prisoner.  They set him down in mock state on an ant-hill, \nand twisted grass about his head, and pretended to pay court to him \non their knees, saying, \'O King, without a kingdom, and Prince \nwithout a people, we hope your gracious Majesty is very well and \nhappy!\'  They did worse than this; they cut his head off, and \nhanded it on a pole to the Queen, who laughed with delight when she \nsaw it (you recollect their walking so religiously and comfortably \nto St. Paul\'s!), and had it fixed, with a paper crown upon its \nhead, on the walls of York.  The Earl of Salisbury lost his head, \ntoo; and the Duke of York\'s second son, a handsome boy who was \nflying with his tutor over Wakefield Bridge, was stabbed in the \nheart by a murderous, lord - Lord Clifford by name - whose father \nhad been killed by the White Roses in the fight at St. Alban\'s.  \nThere was awful sacrifice of life in this battle, for no quarter \nwas given, and the Queen was wild for revenge.  When men \nunnaturally fight against their own countrymen, they are always \nobserved to be more unnaturally cruel and filled with rage than \nthey are against any other enemy.\n\nBut, Lord Clifford had stabbed the second son of the Duke of York - \nnot the first.  The eldest son, Edward Earl of March, was at \nGloucester; and, vowing vengeance for the death of his father, his \nbrother, and their faithful friends, he began to march against the \nQueen.  He had to turn and fight a great body of Welsh and Irish \nfirst, who worried his advance.  These he defeated in a great fight \nat Mortimer\'s Cross, near Hereford, where he beheaded a number of \nthe Red Roses taken in battle, in retaliation for the beheading of \nthe White Roses at Wakefield.  The Queen had the next turn of \nbeheading.  Having moved towards London, and falling in, between \nSt. Alban\'s and Barnet, with the Earl of Warwick and the Duke of \nNorfolk, White Roses both, who were there with an army to oppose \nher, and had got the King with them; she defeated them with great \nloss, and struck off the heads of two prisoners of note, who were \nin the King\'s tent with him, and to whom the King had promised his \nprotection.  Her triumph, however, was very short.  She had no \ntreasure, and her army subsisted by plunder.  This caused them to \nbe hated and dreaded by the people, and particularly by the London \npeople, who were wealthy.  As soon as the Londoners heard that \nEdward, Earl of March, united with the Earl of Warwick, was \nadvancing towards the city, they refused to send the Queen \nsupplies, and made a great rejoicing.\n\nThe Queen and her men retreated with all speed, and Edward and \nWarwick came on, greeted with loud acclamations on every side.  The \ncourage, beauty, and virtues of young Edward could not be \nsufficiently praised by the whole people.  He rode into London like \na conqueror, and met with an enthusiastic welcome.  A few days \nafterwards, Lord Falconbridge and the Bishop of Exeter assembled \nthe citizens in St. John\'s Field, Clerkenwell, and asked them if \nthey would have Henry of Lancaster for their King?  To this they \nall roared, \'No, no, no!\' and \'King Edward!  King Edward!\'  Then, \nsaid those noblemen, would they love and serve young Edward?  To \nthis they all cried, \'Yes, yes!\' and threw up their caps and \nclapped their hands, and cheered tremendously.\n\nTherefore, it was declared that by joining the Queen and not \nprotecting those two prisoners of note, Henry of Lancaster had \nforfeited the crown; and Edward of York was proclaimed King.  He \nmade a great speech to the applauding people at Westminster, and \nsat down as sovereign of England on that throne, on the golden \ncovering of which his father - worthy of a better fate than the \nbloody axe which cut the thread of so many lives in England, \nthrough so many years - had laid his hand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FOURTH\n\n\n\nKING EDWARD THE FOURTH was not quite twenty-one years of age when \nhe took that unquiet seat upon the throne of England.  The \nLancaster party, the Red Roses, were then assembling in great \nnumbers near York, and it was necessary to give them battle \ninstantly.  But, the stout Earl of Warwick leading for the young \nKing, and the young King himself closely following him, and the \nEnglish people crowding round the Royal standard, the White and the \nRed Roses met, on a wild March day when the snow was falling \nheavily, at Towton; and there such a furious battle raged between \nthem, that the total loss amounted to forty thousand men - all \nEnglishmen, fighting, upon English ground, against one another.  \nThe young King gained the day, took down the heads of his father \nand brother from the walls of York, and put up the heads of some of \nthe most famous noblemen engaged in the battle on the other side.  \nThen, he went to London and was crowned with great splendour.\n\nA new Parliament met.  No fewer than one hundred and fifty of the \nprincipal noblemen and gentlemen on the Lancaster side were \ndeclared traitors, and the King - who had very little humanity, \nthough he was handsome in person and agreeable in manners - \nresolved to do all he could, to pluck up the Red Rose root and \nbranch.\n\nQueen Margaret, however, was still active for her young son.  She \nobtained help from Scotland and from Normandy, and took several \nimportant English castles.  But, Warwick soon retook them; the \nQueen lost all her treasure on board ship in a great storm; and \nboth she and her son suffered great misfortunes.  Once, in the \nwinter weather, as they were riding through a forest, they were \nattacked and plundered by a party of robbers; and, when they had \nescaped from these men and were passing alone and on foot through a \nthick dark part of the wood, they came, all at once, upon another \nrobber.  So the Queen, with a stout heart, took the little Prince \nby the hand, and going straight up to that robber, said to him, \'My \nfriend, this is the young son of your lawful King!  I confide him \nto your care.\'  The robber was surprised, but took the boy in his \narms, and faithfully restored him and his mother to their friends.  \nIn the end, the Queen\'s soldiers being beaten and dispersed, she \nwent abroad again, and kept quiet for the present.\n\nNow, all this time, the deposed King Henry was concealed by a Welsh \nknight, who kept him close in his castle.  But, next year, the \nLancaster party recovering their spirits, raised a large body of \nmen, and called him out of his retirement, to put him at their \nhead.  They were joined by some powerful noblemen who had sworn \nfidelity to the new King, but who were ready, as usual, to break \ntheir oaths, whenever they thought there was anything to be got by \nit.  One of the worst things in the history of the war of the Red \nand White Roses, is the ease with which these noblemen, who should \nhave set an example of honour to the people, left either side as \nthey took slight offence, or were disappointed in their greedy \nexpectations, and joined the other.  Well! Warwick\'s brother soon \nbeat the Lancastrians, and the false noblemen, being taken, were \nbeheaded without a moment\'s loss of time.  The deposed King had a \nnarrow escape; three of his servants were taken, and one of them \nbore his cap of estate, which was set with pearls and embroidered \nwith two golden crowns.  However, the head to which the cap \nbelonged, got safely into Lancashire, and lay pretty quietly there \n(the people in the secret being very true) for more than a year.  \nAt length, an old monk gave such intelligence as led to Henry\'s \nbeing taken while he was sitting at dinner in a place called \nWaddington Hall.  He was immediately sent to London, and met at \nIslington by the Earl of Warwick, by whose directions he was put \nupon a horse, with his legs tied under it, and paraded three times \nround the pillory.  Then, he was carried off to the Tower, where \nthey treated him well enough.\n\nThe White Rose being so triumphant, the young King abandoned \nhimself entirely to pleasure, and led a jovial life.  But, thorns \nwere springing up under his bed of roses, as he soon found out.  \nFor, having been privately married to ELIZABETH WOODVILLE, a young \nwidow lady, very beautiful and very captivating; and at last \nresolving to make his secret known, and to declare her his Queen; \nhe gave some offence to the Earl of Warwick, who was usually called \nthe King-Maker, because of his power and influence, and because of \nhis having lent such great help to placing Edward on the throne.  \nThis offence was not lessened by the jealousy with which the Nevil \nfamily (the Earl of Warwick\'s) regarded the promotion of the \nWoodville family.  For, the young Queen was so bent on providing \nfor her relations, that she made her father an earl and a great \nofficer of state; married her five sisters to young noblemen of the \nhighest rank; and provided for her younger brother, a young man of \ntwenty, by marrying him to an immensely rich old duchess of eighty.  \nThe Earl of Warwick took all this pretty graciously for a man of \nhis proud temper, until the question arose to whom the King\'s \nsister, MARGARET, should be married.  The Earl of Warwick said, \'To \none of the French King\'s sons,\' and was allowed to go over to the \nFrench King to make friendly proposals for that purpose, and to \nhold all manner of friendly interviews with him.  But, while he was \nso engaged, the Woodville party married the young lady to the Duke \nof Burgundy!  Upon this he came back in great rage and scorn, and \nshut himself up discontented, in his Castle of Middleham.\n\nA reconciliation, though not a very sincere one, was patched up \nbetween the Earl of Warwick and the King, and lasted until the Earl \nmarried his daughter, against the King\'s wishes, to the Duke of \nClarence.  While the marriage was being celebrated at Calais, the \npeople in the north of England, where the influence of the Nevil \nfamily was strongest, broke out into rebellion; their complaint \nwas, that England was oppressed and plundered by the Woodville \nfamily, whom they demanded to have removed from power.  As they \nwere joined by great numbers of people, and as they openly declared \nthat they were supported by the Earl of Warwick, the King did not \nknow what to do.  At last, as he wrote to the earl beseeching his \naid, he and his new son-in-law came over to England, and began to \narrange the business by shutting the King up in Middleham Castle in \nthe safe keeping of the Archbishop of York; so England was not only \nin the strange position of having two kings at once, but they were \nboth prisoners at the same time.\n\nEven as yet, however, the King-Maker was so far true to the King, \nthat he dispersed a new rising of the Lancastrians, took their \nleader prisoner, and brought him to the King, who ordered him to be \nimmediately executed.  He presently allowed the King to return to \nLondon, and there innumerable pledges of forgiveness and friendship \nwere exchanged between them, and between the Nevils and the \nWoodvilles; the King\'s eldest daughter was promised in marriage to \nthe heir of the Nevil family; and more friendly oaths were sworn, \nand more friendly promises made, than this book would hold.\n\nThey lasted about three months.  At the end of that time, the \nArchbishop of York made a feast for the King, the Earl of Warwick, \nand the Duke of Clarence, at his house, the Moor, in Hertfordshire.  \nThe King was washing his hands before supper, when some one \nwhispered him that a body of a hundred men were lying in ambush \noutside the house.  Whether this were true or untrue, the King took \nfright, mounted his horse, and rode through the dark night to \nWindsor Castle.  Another reconciliation was patched up between him \nand the King-Maker, but it was a short one, and it was the last.  A \nnew rising took place in Lincolnshire, and the King marched to \nrepress it.  Having done so, he proclaimed that both the Earl of \nWarwick and the Duke of Clarence were traitors, who had secretly \nassisted it, and who had been prepared publicly to join it on the \nfollowing day.  In these dangerous circumstances they both took \nship and sailed away to the French court.\n\nAnd here a meeting took place between the Earl of Warwick and his \nold enemy, the Dowager Queen Margaret, through whom his father had \nhad his head struck off, and to whom he had been a bitter foe.  \nBut, now, when he said that he had done with the ungrateful and \nperfidious Edward of York, and that henceforth he devoted himself \nto the restoration of the House of Lancaster, either in the person \nof her husband or of her little son, she embraced him as if he had \never been her dearest friend.  She did more than that; she married \nher son to his second daughter, the Lady Anne.  However agreeable \nthis marriage was to the new friends, it was very disagreeable to \nthe Duke of Clarence, who perceived that his father-in-law, the \nKing-Maker, would never make HIM King, now.  So, being but a weak-\nminded young traitor, possessed of very little worth or sense, he \nreadily listened to an artful court lady sent over for the purpose, \nand promised to turn traitor once more, and go over to his brother, \nKing Edward, when a fitting opportunity should come.\n\nThe Earl of Warwick, knowing nothing of this, soon redeemed his \npromise to the Dowager Queen Margaret, by invading England and \nlanding at Plymouth, where he instantly proclaimed King Henry, and \nsummoned all Englishmen between the ages of sixteen and sixty, to \njoin his banner.  Then, with his army increasing as he marched \nalong, he went northward, and came so near King Edward, who was in \nthat part of the country, that Edward had to ride hard for it to \nthe coast of Norfolk, and thence to get away in such ships as he \ncould find, to Holland.  Thereupon, the triumphant King-Maker and \nhis false son-in-law, the Duke of Clarence, went to London, took \nthe old King out of the Tower, and walked him in a great procession \nto Saint Paul\'s Cathedral with the crown upon his head.  This did \nnot improve the temper of the Duke of Clarence, who saw himself \nfarther off from being King than ever; but he kept his secret, and \nsaid nothing.  The Nevil family were restored to all their honours \nand glories, and the Woodvilles and the rest were disgraced.  The \nKing-Maker, less sanguinary than the King, shed no blood except \nthat of the Earl of Worcester, who had been so cruel to the people \nas to have gained the title of the Butcher.  Him they caught hidden \nin a tree, and him they tried and executed.  No other death stained \nthe King-Maker\'s triumph.\n\nTo dispute this triumph, back came King Edward again, next year, \nlanding at Ravenspur, coming on to York, causing all his men to cry \n\'Long live King Henry!\' and swearing on the altar, without a blush, \nthat he came to lay no claim to the crown.  Now was the time for \nthe Duke of Clarence, who ordered his men to assume the White Rose, \nand declare for his brother.  The Marquis of Montague, though the \nEarl of Warwick\'s brother, also declining to fight against King \nEdward, he went on successfully to London, where the Archbishop of \nYork let him into the City, and where the people made great \ndemonstrations in his favour.  For this they had four reasons.  \nFirstly, there were great numbers of the King\'s adherents hiding in \nthe City and ready to break out; secondly, the King owed them a \ngreat deal of money, which they could never hope to get if he were \nunsuccessful; thirdly, there was a young prince to inherit the \ncrown; and fourthly, the King was gay and handsome, and more \npopular than a better man might have been with the City ladies.  \nAfter a stay of only two days with these worthy supporters, the \nKing marched out to Barnet Common, to give the Earl of Warwick \nbattle.  And now it was to be seen, for the last time, whether the \nKing or the King-Maker was to carry the day.\n\nWhile the battle was yet pending, the fainthearted Duke of Clarence \nbegan to repent, and sent over secret messages to his father-in-\nlaw, offering his services in mediation with the King.  But, the \nEarl of Warwick disdainfully rejected them, and replied that \nClarence was false and perjured, and that he would settle the \nquarrel by the sword.  The battle began at four o\'clock in the \nmorning and lasted until ten, and during the greater part of the \ntime it was fought in a thick mist - absurdly supposed to be raised \nby a magician.  The loss of life was very great, for the hatred was \nstrong on both sides.  The King-Maker was defeated, and the King \ntriumphed.  Both the Earl of Warwick and his brother were slain, \nand their bodies lay in St. Paul\'s, for some days, as a spectacle \nto the people.\n\nMargaret\'s spirit was not broken even by this great blow.  Within \nfive days she was in arms again, and raised her standard in Bath, \nwhence she set off with her army, to try and join Lord Pembroke, \nwho had a force in Wales.  But, the King, coming up with her \noutside the town of Tewkesbury, and ordering his brother, the DUKE \nOF GLOUCESTER, who was a brave soldier, to attack her men, she \nsustained an entire defeat, and was taken prisoner, together with \nher son, now only eighteen years of age.  The conduct of the King \nto this poor youth was worthy of his cruel character.  He ordered \nhim to be led into his tent.  \'And what,\' said he, \'brought YOU to \nEngland?\'  \'I came to England,\' replied the prisoner, with a spirit \nwhich a man of spirit might have admired in a captive, \'to recover \nmy father\'s kingdom, which descended to him as his right, and from \nhim descends to me, as mine.\'  The King, drawing off his iron \ngauntlet, struck him with it in the face; and the Duke of Clarence \nand some other lords, who were there, drew their noble swords, and \nkilled him.\n\nHis mother survived him, a prisoner, for five years; after her \nransom by the King of France, she survived for six years more.  \nWithin three weeks of this murder, Henry died one of those \nconvenient sudden deaths which were so common in the Tower; in \nplainer words, he was murdered by the King\'s order.\n\nHaving no particular excitement on his hands after this great \ndefeat of the Lancaster party, and being perhaps desirous to get \nrid of some of his fat (for he was now getting too corpulent to be \nhandsome), the King thought of making war on France.  As he wanted \nmore money for this purpose than the Parliament could give him, \nthough they were usually ready enough for war, he invented a new \nway of raising it, by sending for the principal citizens of London, \nand telling them, with a grave face, that he was very much in want \nof cash, and would take it very kind in them if they would lend him \nsome.  It being impossible for them safely to refuse, they \ncomplied, and the moneys thus forced from them were called - no \ndoubt to the great amusement of the King and the Court - as if they \nwere free gifts, \'Benevolences.\'  What with grants from Parliament, \nand what with Benevolences, the King raised an army and passed over \nto Calais.  As nobody wanted war, however, the French King made \nproposals of peace, which were accepted, and a truce was concluded \nfor seven long years.  The proceedings between the Kings of France \nand England on this occasion, were very friendly, very splendid, \nand very distrustful.  They finished with a meeting between the two \nKings, on a temporary bridge over the river Somme, where they \nembraced through two holes in a strong wooden grating like a lion\'s \ncage, and made several bows and fine speeches to one another.\n\nIt was time, now, that the Duke of Clarence should be punished for \nhis treacheries; and Fate had his punishment in store.  He was, \nprobably, not trusted by the King - for who could trust him who \nknew him! - and he had certainly a powerful opponent in his brother \nRichard, Duke of Gloucester, who, being avaricious and ambitious, \nwanted to marry that widowed daughter of the Earl of Warwick\'s who \nhad been espoused to the deceased young Prince, at Calais.  \nClarence, who wanted all the family wealth for himself, secreted \nthis lady, whom Richard found disguised as a servant in the City of \nLondon, and whom he married; arbitrators appointed by the King, \nthen divided the property between the brothers.  This led to ill-\nwill and mistrust between them.  Clarence\'s wife dying, and he \nwishing to make another marriage, which was obnoxious to the King, \nhis ruin was hurried by that means, too.  At first, the Court \nstruck at his retainers and dependents, and accused some of them of \nmagic and witchcraft, and similar nonsense.  Successful against \nthis small game, it then mounted to the Duke himself, who was \nimpeached by his brother the King, in person, on a variety of such \ncharges.  He was found guilty, and sentenced to be publicly \nexecuted.  He never was publicly executed, but he met his death \nsomehow, in the Tower, and, no doubt, through some agency of the \nKing or his brother Gloucester, or both.  It was supposed at the \ntime that he was told to choose the manner of his death, and that \nhe chose to be drowned in a butt of Malmsey wine.  I hope the story \nmay be true, for it would have been a becoming death for such a \nmiserable creature.\n\nThe King survived him some five years.  He died in the forty-second \nyear of his life, and the twenty-third of his reign.  He had a very \ngood capacity and some good points, but he was selfish, careless, \nsensual, and cruel.  He was a favourite with the people for his \nshowy manners; and the people were a good example to him in the \nconstancy of their attachment.  He was penitent on his death-bed \nfor his \'benevolences,\' and other extortions, and ordered \nrestitution to be made to the people who had suffered from them.  \nHe also called about his bed the enriched members of the Woodville \nfamily, and the proud lords whose honours were of older date, and \nendeavoured to reconcile them, for the sake of the peaceful \nsuccession of his son and the tranquillity of England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIFTH\n\n\n\nTHE late King\'s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, called EDWARD \nafter him, was only thirteen years of age at his father\'s death.  \nHe was at Ludlow Castle with his uncle, the Earl of Rivers.  The \nprince\'s brother, the Duke of York, only eleven years of age, was \nin London with his mother.  The boldest, most crafty, and most \ndreaded nobleman in England at that time was their uncle RICHARD, \nDuke of Gloucester, and everybody wondered how the two poor boys \nwould fare with such an uncle for a friend or a foe.\n\nThe Queen, their mother, being exceedingly uneasy about this, was \nanxious that instructions should be sent to Lord Rivers to raise an \narmy to escort the young King safely to London.  But, Lord \nHastings, who was of the Court party opposed to the Woodvilles, and \nwho disliked the thought of giving them that power, argued against \nthe proposal, and obliged the Queen to be satisfied with an escort \nof two thousand horse.  The Duke of Gloucester did nothing, at \nfirst, to justify suspicion.  He came from Scotland (where he was \ncommanding an army) to York, and was there the first to swear \nallegiance to his nephew.  He then wrote a condoling letter to the \nQueen-Mother, and set off to be present at the coronation in \nLondon.\n\nNow, the young King, journeying towards London too, with Lord \nRivers and Lord Gray, came to Stony Stratford, as his uncle came to \nNorthampton, about ten miles distant; and when those two lords \nheard that the Duke of Gloucester was so near, they proposed to the \nyoung King that they should go back and greet him in his name.  The \nboy being very willing that they should do so, they rode off and \nwere received with great friendliness, and asked by the Duke of \nGloucester to stay and dine with him.  In the evening, while they \nwere merry together, up came the Duke of Buckingham with three \nhundred horsemen; and next morning the two lords and the two dukes, \nand the three hundred horsemen, rode away together to rejoin the \nKing.  Just as they were entering Stony Stratford, the Duke of \nGloucester, checking his horse, turned suddenly on the two lords, \ncharged them with alienating from him the affections of his sweet \nnephew, and caused them to be arrested by the three hundred \nhorsemen and taken back.  Then, he and the Duke of Buckingham went \nstraight to the King (whom they had now in their power), to whom \nthey made a show of kneeling down, and offering great love and \nsubmission; and then they ordered his attendants to disperse, and \ntook him, alone with them, to Northampton.\n\nA few days afterwards they conducted him to London, and lodged him \nin the Bishop\'s Palace.  But, he did not remain there long; for, \nthe Duke of Buckingham with a tender face made a speech expressing \nhow anxious he was for the Royal boy\'s safety, and how much safer \nhe would be in the Tower until his coronation, than he could be \nanywhere else.  So, to the Tower he was taken, very carefully, and \nthe Duke of Gloucester was named Protector of the State.\n\nAlthough Gloucester had proceeded thus far with a very smooth \ncountenance - and although he was a clever man, fair of speech, and \nnot ill-looking, in spite of one of his shoulders being something \nhigher than the other - and although he had come into the City \nriding bare-headed at the King\'s side, and looking very fond of him \n- he had made the King\'s mother more uneasy yet; and when the Royal \nboy was taken to the Tower, she became so alarmed that she took \nsanctuary in Westminster with her five daughters.\n\nNor did she do this without reason, for, the Duke of Gloucester, \nfinding that the lords who were opposed to the Woodville family \nwere faithful to the young King nevertheless, quickly resolved to \nstrike a blow for himself.  Accordingly, while those lords met in \ncouncil at the Tower, he and those who were in his interest met in \nseparate council at his own residence, Crosby Palace, in \nBishopsgate Street.  Being at last quite prepared, he one day \nappeared unexpectedly at the council in the Tower, and appeared to \nbe very jocular and merry.  He was particularly gay with the Bishop \nof Ely:  praising the strawberries that grew in his garden on \nHolborn Hill, and asking him to have some gathered that he might \neat them at dinner.  The Bishop, quite proud of the honour, sent \none of his men to fetch some; and the Duke, still very jocular and \ngay, went out; and the council all said what a very agreeable duke \nhe was!  In a little time, however, he came back quite altered - \nnot at all jocular - frowning and fierce - and suddenly said, -\n\n\'What do those persons deserve who have compassed my destruction; I \nbeing the King\'s lawful, as well as natural, protector?\'\n\nTo this strange question, Lord Hastings replied, that they deserved \ndeath, whosoever they were.\n\n\'Then,\' said the Duke, \'I tell you that they are that sorceress my \nbrother\'s wife;\' meaning the Queen:  \'and that other sorceress, \nJane Shore.  Who, by witchcraft, have withered my body, and caused \nmy arm to shrink as I now show you.\'\n\nHe then pulled up his sleeve and showed them his arm, which was \nshrunken, it is true, but which had been so, as they all very well \nknew, from the hour of his birth.\n\nJane Shore, being then the lover of Lord Hastings, as she had \nformerly been of the late King, that lord knew that he himself was \nattacked.  So, he said, in some confusion, \'Certainly, my Lord, if \nthey have done this, they be worthy of punishment.\'\n\n\'If?\' said the Duke of Gloucester; \'do you talk to me of ifs?  I \ntell you that they HAVE so done, and I will make it good upon thy \nbody, thou traitor!\'\n\nWith that, he struck the table a great blow with his fist.  This \nwas a signal to some of his people outside to cry \'Treason!\'  They \nimmediately did so, and there was a rush into the chamber of so \nmany armed men that it was filled in a moment.\n\n\'First,\' said the Duke of Gloucester to Lord Hastings, \'I arrest \nthee, traitor!  And let him,\' he added to the armed men who took \nhim, \'have a priest at once, for by St. Paul I will not dine until \nI have seen his head of!\'\n\nLord Hastings was hurried to the green by the Tower chapel, and \nthere beheaded on a log of wood that happened to be lying on the \nground.  Then, the Duke dined with a good appetite, and after \ndinner summoning the principal citizens to attend him, told them \nthat Lord Hastings and the rest had designed to murder both himself \nand the Duke if Buckingham, who stood by his side, if he had not \nprovidentially discovered their design.  He requested them to be so \nobliging as to inform their fellow-citizens of the truth of what he \nsaid, and issued a proclamation (prepared and neatly copied out \nbeforehand) to the same effect.\n\nOn the same day that the Duke did these things in the Tower, Sir \nRichard Ratcliffe, the boldest and most undaunted of his men, went \ndown to Pontefract; arrested Lord Rivers, Lord Gray, and two other \ngentlemen; and publicly executed them on the scaffold, without any \ntrial, for having intended the Duke\'s death.  Three days afterwards \nthe Duke, not to lose time, went down the river to Westminster in \nhis barge, attended by divers bishops, lords, and soldiers, and \ndemanded that the Queen should deliver her second son, the Duke of \nYork, into his safe keeping.  The Queen, being obliged to comply, \nresigned the child after she had wept over him; and Richard of \nGloucester placed him with his brother in the Tower.  Then, he \nseized Jane Shore, and, because she had been the lover of the late \nKing, confiscated her property, and got her sentenced to do public \npenance in the streets by walking in a scanty dress, with bare \nfeet, and carrying a lighted candle, to St. Paul\'s Cathedral, \nthrough the most crowded part of the City.\n\nHaving now all things ready for his own advancement, he caused a \nfriar to preach a sermon at the cross which stood in front of St. \nPaul\'s Cathedral, in which he dwelt upon the profligate manners of \nthe late King, and upon the late shame of Jane Shore, and hinted \nthat the princes were not his children.  \'Whereas, good people,\' \nsaid the friar, whose name was SHAW, \'my Lord the Protector, the \nnoble Duke of Gloucester, that sweet prince, the pattern of all the \nnoblest virtues, is the perfect image and express likeness of his \nfather.\'  There had been a little plot between the Duke and the \nfriar, that the Duke should appear in the crowd at this moment, \nwhen it was expected that the people would cry \'Long live King \nRichard!\'  But, either through the friar saying the words too soon, \nor through the Duke\'s coming too late, the Duke and the words did \nnot come together, and the people only laughed, and the friar \nsneaked off ashamed.\n\nThe Duke of Buckingham was a better hand at such business than the \nfriar, so he went to the Guildhall the next day, and addressed the \ncitizens in the Lord Protector\'s behalf.  A few dirty men, who had \nbeen hired and stationed there for the purpose, crying when he had \ndone, \'God save King Richard!\' he made them a great bow, and \nthanked them with all his heart.  Next day, to make an end of it, \nhe went with the mayor and some lords and citizens to Bayard \nCastle, by the river, where Richard then was, and read an address, \nhumbly entreating him to accept the Crown of England.  Richard, who \nlooked down upon them out of a window and pretended to be in great \nuneasiness and alarm, assured them there was nothing he desired \nless, and that his deep affection for his nephews forbade him to \nthink of it.  To this the Duke of Buckingham replied, with \npretended warmth, that the free people of England would never \nsubmit to his nephew\'s rule, and that if Richard, who was the \nlawful heir, refused the Crown, why then they must find some one \nelse to wear it.  The Duke of Gloucester returned, that since he \nused that strong language, it became his painful duty to think no \nmore of himself, and to accept the Crown.\n\nUpon that, the people cheered and dispersed; and the Duke of \nGloucester and the Duke of Buckingham passed a pleasant evening, \ntalking over the play they had just acted with so much success, and \nevery word of which they had prepared together.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV - ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE THIRD\n\n\n\nKING RICHARD THE THIRD was up betimes in the morning, and went to \nWestminster Hall.  In the Hall was a marble seat, upon which he sat \nhimself down between two great noblemen, and told the people that \nhe began the new reign in that place, because the first duty of a \nsovereign was to administer the laws equally to all, and to \nmaintain justice.  He then mounted his horse and rode back to the \nCity, where he was received by the clergy and the crowd as if he \nreally had a right to the throne, and really were a just man.  The \nclergy and the crowd must have been rather ashamed of themselves in \nsecret, I think, for being such poor-spirited knaves.\n\nThe new King and his Queen were soon crowned with a great deal of \nshow and noise, which the people liked very much; and then the King \nset forth on a royal progress through his dominions.  He was \ncrowned a second time at York, in order that the people might have \nshow and noise enough; and wherever he went was received with \nshouts of rejoicing - from a good many people of strong lungs, who \nwere paid to strain their throats in crying, \'God save King \nRichard!\'  The plan was so successful that I am told it has been \nimitated since, by other usurpers, in other progresses through \nother dominions.\n\nWhile he was on this journey, King Richard stayed a week at \nWarwick.  And from Warwick he sent instructions home for one of the \nwickedest murders that ever was done - the murder of the two young \nprinces, his nephews, who were shut up in the Tower of London.\n\nSir Robert Brackenbury was at that time Governor of the Tower.  To \nhim, by the hands of a messenger named JOHN GREEN, did King Richard \nsend a letter, ordering him by some means to put the two young \nprinces to death.  But Sir Robert - I hope because he had children \nof his own, and loved them - sent John Green back again, riding and \nspurring along the dusty roads, with the answer that he could not \ndo so horrible a piece of work.  The King, having frowningly \nconsidered a little, called to him SIR JAMES TYRREL, his master of \nthe horse, and to him gave authority to take command of the Tower, \nwhenever he would, for twenty-four hours, and to keep all the keys \nof the Tower during that space of time.  Tyrrel, well knowing what \nwas wanted, looked about him for two hardened ruffians, and chose \nJOHN DIGHTON, one of his own grooms, and MILES FOREST, who was a \nmurderer by trade.  Having secured these two assistants, he went, \nupon a day in August, to the Tower, showed his authority from the \nKing, took the command for four-and-twenty hours, and obtained \npossession of the keys.  And when the black night came he went \ncreeping, creeping, like a guilty villain as he was, up the dark, \nstone winding stairs, and along the dark stone passages, until he \ncame to the door of the room where the two young princes, having \nsaid their prayers, lay fast asleep, clasped in each other\'s arms.  \nAnd while he watched and listened at the door, he sent in those \nevil demons, John Dighton and Miles Forest, who smothered the two \nprinces with the bed and pillows, and carried their bodies down the \nstairs, and buried them under a great heap of stones at the \nstaircase foot.  And when the day came, he gave up the command of \nthe Tower, and restored the keys, and hurried away without once \nlooking behind him; and Sir Robert Brackenbury went with fear and \nsadness to the princes\' room, and found the princes gone for ever.\n\nYou know, through all this history, how true it is that traitors \nare never true, and you will not be surprised to learn that the \nDuke of Buckingham soon turned against King Richard, and joined a \ngreat conspiracy that was formed to dethrone him, and to place the \ncrown upon its rightful owner\'s head.  Richard had meant to keep \nthe murder secret; but when he heard through his spies that this \nconspiracy existed, and that many lords and gentlemen drank in \nsecret to the healths of the two young princes in the Tower, he \nmade it known that they were dead.  The conspirators, though \nthwarted for a moment, soon resolved to set up for the crown \nagainst the murderous Richard, HENRY Earl of Richmond, grandson of \nCatherine:  that widow of Henry the Fifth who married Owen Tudor.  \nAnd as Henry was of the house of Lancaster, they proposed that he \nshould marry the Princess Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of the \nlate King, now the heiress of the house of York, and thus by \nuniting the rival families put an end to the fatal wars of the Red \nand White Roses.  All being settled, a time was appointed for Henry \nto come over from Brittany, and for a great rising against Richard \nto take place in several parts of England at the same hour.  On a \ncertain day, therefore, in October, the revolt took place; but \nunsuccessfully.  Richard was prepared, Henry was driven back at sea \nby a storm, his followers in England were dispersed, and the Duke \nof Buckingham was taken, and at once beheaded in the market-place \nat Salisbury.\n\nThe time of his success was a good time, Richard thought, for \nsummoning a Parliament and getting some money.  So, a Parliament \nwas called, and it flattered and fawned upon him as much as he \ncould possibly desire, and declared him to be the rightful King of \nEngland, and his only son Edward, then eleven years of age, the \nnext heir to the throne.\n\nRichard knew full well that, let the Parliament say what it would, \nthe Princess Elizabeth was remembered by people as the heiress of \nthe house of York; and having accurate information besides, of its \nbeing designed by the conspirators to marry her to Henry of \nRichmond, he felt that it would much strengthen him and weaken \nthem, to be beforehand with them, and marry her to his son.  With \nthis view he went to the Sanctuary at Westminster, where the late \nKing\'s widow and her daughter still were, and besought them to come \nto Court:  where (he swore by anything and everything) they should \nbe safely and honourably entertained.  They came, accordingly, but \nhad scarcely been at Court a month when his son died suddenly - or \nwas poisoned - and his plan was crushed to pieces.\n\nIn this extremity, King Richard, always active, thought, \'I must \nmake another plan.\'  And he made the plan of marrying the Princess \nElizabeth himself, although she was his niece.  There was one \ndifficulty in the way:  his wife, the Queen Anne, was alive.  But, \nhe knew (remembering his nephews) how to remove that obstacle, and \nhe made love to the Princess Elizabeth, telling her he felt \nperfectly confident that the Queen would die in February.  The \nPrincess was not a very scrupulous young lady, for, instead of \nrejecting the murderer of her brothers with scorn and hatred, she \nopenly declared she loved him dearly; and, when February came and \nthe Queen did not die, she expressed her impatient opinion that she \nwas too long about it.  However, King Richard was not so far out in \nhis prediction, but, that she died in March - he took good care of \nthat - and then this precious pair hoped to be married.  But they \nwere disappointed, for the idea of such a marriage was so unpopular \nin the country, that the King\'s chief counsellors, RATCLIFFE and \nCATESBY, would by no means undertake to propose it, and the King \nwas even obliged to declare in public that he had never thought of \nsuch a thing.\n\nHe was, by this time, dreaded and hated by all classes of his \nsubjects.  His nobles deserted every day to Henry\'s side; he dared \nnot call another Parliament, lest his crimes should be denounced \nthere; and for want of money, he was obliged to get Benevolences \nfrom the citizens, which exasperated them all against him.  It was \nsaid too, that, being stricken by his conscience, he dreamed \nfrightful dreams, and started up in the night-time, wild with \nterror and remorse.  Active to the last, through all this, he \nissued vigorous proclamations against Henry of Richmond and all his \nfollowers, when he heard that they were coming against him with a \nFleet from France; and took the field as fierce and savage as a \nwild boar - the animal represented on his shield.\n\nHenry of Richmond landed with six thousand men at Milford Haven, \nand came on against King Richard, then encamped at Leicester with \nan army twice as great, through North Wales.  On Bosworth Field the \ntwo armies met; and Richard, looking along Henry\'s ranks, and \nseeing them crowded with the English nobles who had abandoned him, \nturned pale when he beheld the powerful Lord Stanley and his son \n(whom he had tried hard to retain) among them.  But, he was as \nbrave as he was wicked, and plunged into the thickest of the fight.  \nHe was riding hither and thither, laying about him in all \ndirections, when he observed the Earl of Northumberland - one of \nhis few great allies - to stand inactive, and the main body of his \ntroops to hesitate.  At the same moment, his desperate glance \ncaught Henry of Richmond among a little group of his knights.  \nRiding hard at him, and crying \'Treason!\' he killed his standard-\nbearer, fiercely unhorsed another gentleman, and aimed a powerful \nstroke at Henry himself, to cut him down.  But, Sir William Stanley \nparried it as it fell, and before Richard could raise his arm \nagain, he was borne down in a press of numbers, unhorsed, and \nkilled.  Lord Stanley picked up the crown, all bruised and \ntrampled, and stained with blood, and put it upon Richmond\'s head, \namid loud and rejoicing cries of \'Long live King Henry!\'\n\nThat night, a horse was led up to the church of the Grey Friars at \nLeicester; across whose back was tied, like some worthless sack, a \nnaked body brought there for burial.  It was the body of the last \nof the Plantagenet line, King Richard the Third, usurper and \nmurderer, slain at the battle of Bosworth Field in the thirty-\nsecond year of his age, after a reign of two years.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SEVENTH\n\n\n\nKING HENRY THE SEVENTH did not turn out to be as fine a fellow as \nthe nobility and people hoped, in the first joy of their \ndeliverance from Richard the Third.  He was very cold, crafty, and \ncalculating, and would do almost anything for money.  He possessed \nconsiderable ability, but his chief merit appears to have been that \nhe was not cruel when there was nothing to be got by it.\n\nThe new King had promised the nobles who had espoused his cause \nthat he would marry the Princess Elizabeth.  The first thing he \ndid, was, to direct her to be removed from the castle of Sheriff \nHutton in Yorkshire, where Richard had placed her, and restored to \nthe care of her mother in London.  The young Earl of Warwick, \nEdward Plantagenet, son and heir of the late Duke of Clarence, had \nbeen kept a prisoner in the same old Yorkshire Castle with her.  \nThis boy, who was now fifteen, the new King placed in the Tower for \nsafety.  Then he came to London in great state, and gratified the \npeople with a fine procession; on which kind of show he often very \nmuch relied for keeping them in good humour.  The sports and feasts \nwhich took place were followed by a terrible fever, called the \nSweating Sickness; of which great numbers of people died.  Lord \nMayors and Aldermen are thought to have suffered most from it; \nwhether, because they were in the habit of over-eating themselves, \nor because they were very jealous of preserving filth and nuisances \nin the City (as they have been since), I don\'t know.\n\nThe King\'s coronation was postponed on account of the general ill-\nhealth, and he afterwards deferred his marriage, as if he were not \nvery anxious that it should take place:  and, even after that, \ndeferred the Queen\'s coronation so long that he gave offence to the \nYork party.  However, he set these things right in the end, by \nhanging some men and seizing on the rich possessions of others; by \ngranting more popular pardons to the followers of the late King \nthan could, at first, be got from him; and, by employing about his \nCourt, some very scrupulous persons who had been employed in the \nprevious reign.\n\nAs this reign was principally remarkable for two very curious \nimpostures which have become famous in history, we will make those \ntwo stories its principal feature.\n\nThere was a priest at Oxford of the name of Simons, who had for a \npupil a handsome boy named Lambert Simnel, the son of a baker.  \nPartly to gratify his own ambitious ends, and partly to carry out \nthe designs of a secret party formed against the King, this priest \ndeclared that his pupil, the boy, was no other than the young Earl \nof Warwick; who (as everybody might have known) was safely locked \nup in the Tower of London.  The priest and the boy went over to \nIreland; and, at Dublin, enlisted in their cause all ranks of the \npeople:  who seem to have been generous enough, but exceedingly \nirrational.  The Earl of Kildare, the governor of Ireland, declared \nthat he believed the boy to be what the priest represented; and the \nboy, who had been well tutored by the priest, told them such things \nof his childhood, and gave them so many descriptions of the Royal \nFamily, that they were perpetually shouting and hurrahing, and \ndrinking his health, and making all kinds of noisy and thirsty \ndemonstrations, to express their belief in him.  Nor was this \nfeeling confined to Ireland alone, for the Earl of Lincoln - whom \nthe late usurper had named as his successor - went over to the \nyoung Pretender; and, after holding a secret correspondence with \nthe Dowager Duchess of Burgundy - the sister of Edward the Fourth, \nwho detested the present King and all his race - sailed to Dublin \nwith two thousand German soldiers of her providing.  In this \npromising state of the boy\'s fortunes, he was crowned there, with a \ncrown taken off the head of a statue of the Virgin Mary; and was \nthen, according to the Irish custom of those days, carried home on \nthe shoulders of a big chieftain possessing a great deal more \nstrength than sense.  Father Simons, you may be sure, was mighty \nbusy at the coronation.\n\nTen days afterwards, the Germans, and the Irish, and the priest, \nand the boy, and the Earl of Lincoln, all landed in Lancashire to \ninvade England.  The King, who had good intelligence of their \nmovements, set up his standard at Nottingham, where vast numbers \nresorted to him every day; while the Earl of Lincoln could gain but \nvery few.  With his small force he tried to make for the town of \nNewark; but the King\'s army getting between him and that place, he \nhad no choice but to risk a battle at Stoke.  It soon ended in the \ncomplete destruction of the Pretender\'s forces, one half of whom \nwere killed; among them, the Earl himself.  The priest and the \nbaker\'s boy were taken prisoners.  The priest, after confessing the \ntrick, was shut up in prison, where he afterwards died - suddenly \nperhaps.  The boy was taken into the King\'s kitchen and made a \nturnspit.  He was afterwards raised to the station of one of the \nKing\'s falconers; and so ended this strange imposition.\n\nThere seems reason to suspect that the Dowager Queen - always a \nrestless and busy woman - had had some share in tutoring the \nbaker\'s son.  The King was very angry with her, whether or no.  He \nseized upon her property, and shut her up in a convent at \nBermondsey.\n\nOne might suppose that the end of this story would have put the \nIrish people on their guard; but they were quite ready to receive a \nsecond impostor, as they had received the first, and that same \ntroublesome Duchess of Burgundy soon gave them the opportunity.  \nAll of a sudden there appeared at Cork, in a vessel arriving from \nPortugal, a young man of excellent abilities, of very handsome \nappearance and most winning manners, who declared himself to be \nRichard, Duke of York, the second son of King Edward the Fourth.  \n\'O,\' said some, even of those ready Irish believers, \'but surely \nthat young Prince was murdered by his uncle in the Tower!\' - \'It IS \nsupposed so,\' said the engaging young man; \'and my brother WAS \nkilled in that gloomy prison; but I escaped - it don\'t matter how, \nat present - and have been wandering about the world for seven long \nyears.\'  This explanation being quite satisfactory to numbers of \nthe Irish people, they began again to shout and to hurrah, and to \ndrink his health, and to make the noisy and thirsty demonstrations \nall over again.  And the big chieftain in Dublin began to look out \nfor another coronation, and another young King to be carried home \non his back.\n\nNow, King Henry being then on bad terms with France, the French \nKing, Charles the Eighth, saw that, by pretending to believe in the \nhandsome young man, he could trouble his enemy sorely.  So, he \ninvited him over to the French Court, and appointed him a body-\nguard, and treated him in all respects as if he really were the \nDuke of York.  Peace, however, being soon concluded between the two \nKings, the pretended Duke was turned adrift, and wandered for \nprotection to the Duchess of Burgundy.  She, after feigning to \ninquire into the reality of his claims, declared him to be the very \npicture of her dear departed brother; gave him a body-guard at her \nCourt, of thirty halberdiers; and called him by the sounding name \nof the White Rose of England.\n\nThe leading members of the White Rose party in England sent over an \nagent, named Sir Robert Clifford, to ascertain whether the White \nRose\'s claims were good:  the King also sent over his agents to \ninquire into the Rose\'s history.  The White Roses declared the \nyoung man to be really the Duke of York; the King declared him to \nbe PERKIN WARBECK, the son of a merchant of the city of Tournay, \nwho had acquired his knowledge of England, its language and \nmanners, from the English merchants who traded in Flanders; it was \nalso stated by the Royal agents that he had been in the service of \nLady Brompton, the wife of an exiled English nobleman, and that the \nDuchess of Burgundy had caused him to be trained and taught, \nexpressly for this deception.  The King then required the Archduke \nPhilip - who was the sovereign of Burgundy - to banish this new \nPretender, or to deliver him up; but, as the Archduke replied that \nhe could not control the Duchess in her own land, the King, in \nrevenge, took the market of English cloth away from Antwerp, and \nprevented all commercial intercourse between the two countries.\n\nHe also, by arts and bribes, prevailed on Sir Robert Clifford to \nbetray his employers; and he denouncing several famous English \nnoblemen as being secretly the friends of Perkin Warbeck, the King \nhad three of the foremost executed at once.  Whether he pardoned \nthe remainder because they were poor, I do not know; but it is only \ntoo probable that he refused to pardon one famous nobleman against \nwhom the same Clifford soon afterwards informed separately, because \nhe was rich.  This was no other than Sir William Stanley, who had \nsaved the King\'s life at the battle of Bosworth Field.  It is very \ndoubtful whether his treason amounted to much more than his having \nsaid, that if he were sure the young man was the Duke of York, he \nwould not take arms against him.  Whatever he had done he admitted, \nlike an honourable spirit; and he lost his head for it, and the \ncovetous King gained all his wealth.\n\nPerkin Warbeck kept quiet for three years; but, as the Flemings \nbegan to complain heavily of the loss of their trade by the \nstoppage of the Antwerp market on his account, and as it was not \nunlikely that they might even go so far as to take his life, or \ngive him up, he found it necessary to do something.  Accordingly he \nmade a desperate sally, and landed, with only a few hundred men, on \nthe coast of Deal.  But he was soon glad to get back to the place \nfrom whence he came; for the country people rose against his \nfollowers, killed a great many, and took a hundred and fifty \nprisoners:  who were all driven to London, tied together with \nropes, like a team of cattle.  Every one of them was hanged on some \npart or other of the sea-shore; in order, that if any more men \nshould come over with Perkin Warbeck, they might see the bodies as \na warning before they landed.\n\nThen the wary King, by making a treaty of commerce with the \nFlemings, drove Perkin Warbeck out of that country; and, by \ncompletely gaining over the Irish to his side, deprived him of that \nasylum too.  He wandered away to Scotland, and told his story at \nthat Court.  King James the Fourth of Scotland, who was no friend \nto King Henry, and had no reason to be (for King Henry had bribed \nhis Scotch lords to betray him more than once; but had never \nsucceeded in his plots), gave him a great reception, called him his \ncousin, and gave him in marriage the Lady Catherine Gordon, a \nbeautiful and charming creature related to the royal house of \nStuart.\n\nAlarmed by this successful reappearance of the Pretender, the King \nstill undermined, and bought, and bribed, and kept his doings and \nPerkin Warbeck\'s story in the dark, when he might, one would \nimagine, have rendered the matter clear to all England.  But, for \nall this bribing of the Scotch lords at the Scotch King\'s Court, he \ncould not procure the Pretender to be delivered up to him.  James, \nthough not very particular in many respects, would not betray him; \nand the ever-busy Duchess of Burgundy so provided him with arms, \nand good soldiers, and with money besides, that he had soon a \nlittle army of fifteen hundred men of various nations.  With these, \nand aided by the Scottish King in person, he crossed the border \ninto England, and made a proclamation to the people, in which he \ncalled the King \'Henry Tudor;\' offered large rewards to any who \nshould take or distress him; and announced himself as King Richard \nthe Fourth come to receive the homage of his faithful subjects.  \nHis faithful subjects, however, cared nothing for him, and hated \nhis faithful troops:  who, being of different nations, quarrelled \nalso among themselves.  Worse than this, if worse were possible, \nthey began to plunder the country; upon which the White Rose said, \nthat he would rather lose his rights, than gain them through the \nmiseries of the English people.  The Scottish King made a jest of \nhis scruples; but they and their whole force went back again \nwithout fighting a battle.\n\nThe worst consequence of this attempt was, that a rising took place \namong the people of Cornwall, who considered themselves too heavily \ntaxed to meet the charges of the expected war.  Stimulated by \nFlammock, a lawyer, and Joseph, a blacksmith, and joined by Lord \nAudley and some other country gentlemen, they marched on all the \nway to Deptford Bridge, where they fought a battle with the King\'s \narmy.  They were defeated - though the Cornish men fought with \ngreat bravery - and the lord was beheaded, and the lawyer and the \nblacksmith were hanged, drawn, and quartered.  The rest were \npardoned.  The King, who believed every man to be as avaricious as \nhimself, and thought that money could settle anything, allowed them \nto make bargains for their liberty with the soldiers who had taken \nthem.\n\nPerkin Warbeck, doomed to wander up and down, and never to find \nrest anywhere - a sad fate:  almost a sufficient punishment for an \nimposture, which he seems in time to have half believed himself - \nlost his Scottish refuge through a truce being made between the two \nKings; and found himself, once more, without a country before him \nin which he could lay his head.  But James (always honourable and \ntrue to him, alike when he melted down his plate, and even the \ngreat gold chain he had been used to wear, to pay soldiers in his \ncause; and now, when that cause was lost and hopeless) did not \nconclude the treaty, until he had safely departed out of the \nScottish dominions.  He, and his beautiful wife, who was faithful \nto him under all reverses, and left her state and home to follow \nhis poor fortunes, were put aboard ship with everything necessary \nfor their comfort and protection, and sailed for Ireland.\n\nBut, the Irish people had had enough of counterfeit Earls of \nWarwick and Dukes of York, for one while; and would give the White \nRose no aid.  So, the White Rose - encircled by thorns indeed - \nresolved to go with his beautiful wife to Cornwall as a forlorn \nresource, and see what might be made of the Cornish men, who had \nrisen so valiantly a little while before, and who had fought so \nbravely at Deptford Bridge.\n\nTo Whitsand Bay, in Cornwall, accordingly, came Perkin Warbeck and \nhis wife; and the lovely lady he shut up for safety in the Castle \nof St. Michael\'s Mount, and then marched into Devonshire at the \nhead of three thousand Cornishmen.  These were increased to six \nthousand by the time of his arrival in Exeter; but, there the \npeople made a stout resistance, and he went on to Taunton, where he \ncame in sight of the King\'s army.  The stout Cornish men, although \nthey were few in number, and badly armed, were so bold, that they \nnever thought of retreating; but bravely looked forward to a battle \non the morrow.  Unhappily for them, the man who was possessed of so \nmany engaging qualities, and who attracted so many people to his \nside when he had nothing else with which to tempt them, was not as \nbrave as they.  In the night, when the two armies lay opposite to \neach other, he mounted a swift horse and fled.  When morning \ndawned, the poor confiding Cornish men, discovering that they had \nno leader, surrendered to the King\'s power.  Some of them were \nhanged, and the rest were pardoned and went miserably home.\n\nBefore the King pursued Perkin Warbeck to the sanctuary of Beaulieu \nin the New Forest, where it was soon known that he had taken \nrefuge, he sent a body of horsemen to St. Michael\'s Mount, to seize \nhis wife.  She was soon taken and brought as a captive before the \nKing.  But she was so beautiful, and so good, and so devoted to the \nman in whom she believed, that the King regarded her with \ncompassion, treated her with great respect, and placed her at \nCourt, near the Queen\'s person.  And many years after Perkin \nWarbeck was no more, and when his strange story had become like a \nnursery tale, SHE was called the White Rose, by the people, in \nremembrance of her beauty.\n\nThe sanctuary at Beaulieu was soon surrounded by the King\'s men; \nand the King, pursuing his usual dark, artful ways, sent pretended \nfriends to Perkin Warbeck to persuade him to come out and surrender \nhimself.  This he soon did; the King having taken a good look at \nthe man of whom he had heard so much - from behind a screen - \ndirected him to be well mounted, and to ride behind him at a little \ndistance, guarded, but not bound in any way.  So they entered \nLondon with the King\'s favourite show - a procession; and some of \nthe people hooted as the Pretender rode slowly through the streets \nto the Tower; but the greater part were quiet, and very curious to \nsee him.  From the Tower, he was taken to the Palace at \nWestminster, and there lodged like a gentleman, though closely \nwatched.  He was examined every now and then as to his imposture; \nbut the King was so secret in all he did, that even then he gave it \na consequence, which it cannot be supposed to have in itself \ndeserved.\n\nAt last Perkin Warbeck ran away, and took refuge in another \nsanctuary near Richmond in Surrey.  From this he was again \npersuaded to deliver himself up; and, being conveyed to London, he \nstood in the stocks for a whole day, outside Westminster Hall, and \nthere read a paper purporting to be his full confession, and \nrelating his history as the King\'s agents had originally described \nit.  He was then shut up in the Tower again, in the company of the \nEarl of Warwick, who had now been there for fourteen years:  ever \nsince his removal out of Yorkshire, except when the King had had \nhim at Court, and had shown him to the people, to prove the \nimposture of the Baker\'s boy.  It is but too probable, when we \nconsider the crafty character of Henry the Seventh, that these two \nwere brought together for a cruel purpose.  A plot was soon \ndiscovered between them and the keepers, to murder the Governor, \nget possession of the keys, and proclaim Perkin Warbeck as King \nRichard the Fourth.  That there was some such plot, is likely; that \nthey were tempted into it, is at least as likely; that the \nunfortunate Earl of Warwick - last male of the Plantagenet line - \nwas too unused to the world, and too ignorant and simple to know \nmuch about it, whatever it was, is perfectly certain; and that it \nwas the King\'s interest to get rid of him, is no less so.  He was \nbeheaded on Tower Hill, and Perkin Warbeck was hanged at Tyburn.\n\nSuch was the end of the pretended Duke of York, whose shadowy \nhistory was made more shadowy - and ever will be - by the mystery \nand craft of the King.  If he had turned his great natural \nadvantages to a more honest account, he might have lived a happy \nand respected life, even in those days.  But he died upon a gallows \nat Tyburn, leaving the Scottish lady, who had loved him so well, \nkindly protected at the Queen\'s Court.  After some time she forgot \nher old loves and troubles, as many people do with Time\'s merciful \nassistance, and married a Welsh gentleman.  Her second husband, SIR \nMATTHEW CRADOC, more honest and more happy than her first, lies \nbeside her in a tomb in the old church of Swansea.\n\nThe ill-blood between France and England in this reign, arose out \nof the continued plotting of the Duchess of Burgundy, and disputes \nrespecting the affairs of Brittany.  The King feigned to be very \npatriotic, indignant, and warlike; but he always contrived so as \nnever to make war in reality, and always to make money.  His \ntaxation of the people, on pretence of war with France, involved, \nat one time, a very dangerous insurrection, headed by Sir John \nEgremont, and a common man called John a Chambre.  But it was \nsubdued by the royal forces, under the command of the Earl of \nSurrey.  The knighted John escaped to the Duchess of Burgundy, who \nwas ever ready to receive any one who gave the King trouble; and \nthe plain John was hanged at York, in the midst of a number of his \nmen, but on a much higher gibbet, as being a greater traitor.  Hung \nhigh or hung low, however, hanging is much the same to the person \nhung.\n\nWithin a year after her marriage, the Queen had given birth to a \nson, who was called Prince Arthur, in remembrance of the old \nBritish prince of romance and story; and who, when all these events \nhad happened, being then in his fifteenth year, was married to \nCATHERINE, the daughter of the Spanish monarch, with great \nrejoicings and bright prospects; but in a very few months he \nsickened and died.  As soon as the King had recovered from his \ngrief, he thought it a pity that the fortune of the Spanish \nPrincess, amounting to two hundred thousand crowns, should go out \nof the family; and therefore arranged that the young widow should \nmarry his second son HENRY, then twelve years of age, when he too \nshould be fifteen.  There were objections to this marriage on the \npart of the clergy; but, as the infallible Pope was gained over, \nand, as he MUST be right, that settled the business for the time.  \nThe King\'s eldest daughter was provided for, and a long course of \ndisturbance was considered to be set at rest, by her being married \nto the Scottish King.\n\nAnd now the Queen died.  When the King had got over that grief too, \nhis mind once more reverted to his darling money for consolation, \nand he thought of marrying the Dowager Queen of Naples, who was \nimmensely rich:  but, as it turned out not to be practicable to \ngain the money however practicable it might have been to gain the \nlady, he gave up the idea.  He was not so fond of her but that he \nsoon proposed to marry the Dowager Duchess of Savoy; and, soon \nafterwards, the widow of the King of Castile, who was raving mad.  \nBut he made a money-bargain instead, and married neither.\n\nThe Duchess of Burgundy, among the other discontented people to \nwhom she had given refuge, had sheltered EDMUND DE LA POLE (younger \nbrother of that Earl of Lincoln who was killed at Stoke), now Earl \nof Suffolk.  The King had prevailed upon him to return to the \nmarriage of Prince Arthur; but, he soon afterwards went away again; \nand then the King, suspecting a conspiracy, resorted to his \nfavourite plan of sending him some treacherous friends, and buying \nof those scoundrels the secrets they disclosed or invented.  Some \narrests and executions took place in consequence.  In the end, the \nKing, on a promise of not taking his life, obtained possession of \nthe person of Edmund de la Pole, and shut him up in the Tower.\n\nThis was his last enemy.  If he had lived much longer he would have \nmade many more among the people, by the grinding exaction to which \nhe constantly exposed them, and by the tyrannical acts of his two \nprime favourites in all money-raising matters, EDMUND DUDLEY and \nRICHARD EMPSON.  But Death - the enemy who is not to be bought off \nor deceived, and on whom no money, and no treachery has any effect \n- presented himself at this juncture, and ended the King\'s reign.  \nHe died of the gout, on the twenty-second of April, one thousand \nfive hundred and nine, and in the fifty-third year of his age, \nafter reigning twenty-four years; he was buried in the beautiful \nChapel of Westminster Abbey, which he had himself founded, and \nwhich still bears his name.\n\nIt was in this reign that the great CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, on behalf \nof Spain, discovered what was then called The New World.  Great \nwonder, interest, and hope of wealth being awakened in England \nthereby, the King and the merchants of London and Bristol fitted \nout an English expedition for further discoveries in the New World, \nand entrusted it to SEBASTIAN CABOT, of Bristol, the son of a \nVenetian pilot there.  He was very successful in his voyage, and \ngained high reputation, both for himself and England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH, CALLED BLUFF KING \nHAL AND BURLY KING HARRY\n\n\n\nPART THE FIRST\n\n\nWE now come to King Henry the Eighth, whom it has been too much the \nfashion to call \'Bluff King Hal,\' and \'Burly King Harry,\' and other \nfine names; but whom I shall take the liberty to call, plainly, one \nof the most detestable villains that ever drew breath.  You will be \nable to judge, long before we come to the end of his life, whether \nhe deserves the character.\n\nHe was just eighteen years of age when he came to the throne.  \nPeople said he was handsome then; but I don\'t believe it.  He was a \nbig, burly, noisy, small-eyed, large-faced, double-chinned, \nswinish-looking fellow in later life (as we know from the \nlikenesses of him, painted by the famous HANS HOLBEIN), and it is \nnot easy to believe that so bad a character can ever have been \nveiled under a prepossessing appearance.\n\nHe was anxious to make himself popular; and the people, who had \nlong disliked the late King, were very willing to believe that he \ndeserved to be so.  He was extremely fond of show and display, and \nso were they.  Therefore there was great rejoicing when he married \nthe Princess Catherine, and when they were both crowned.  And the \nKing fought at tournaments and always came off victorious - for the \ncourtiers took care of that - and there was a general outcry that \nhe was a wonderful man.  Empson, Dudley, and their supporters were \naccused of a variety of crimes they had never committed, instead of \nthe offences of which they really had been guilty; and they were \npilloried, and set upon horses with their faces to the tails, and \nknocked about and beheaded, to the satisfaction of the people, and \nthe enrichment of the King.\n\nThe Pope, so indefatigable in getting the world into trouble, had \nmixed himself up in a war on the continent of Europe, occasioned by \nthe reigning Princes of little quarrelling states in Italy having \nat various times married into other Royal families, and so led to \nTHEIR claiming a share in those petty Governments.  The King, who \ndiscovered that he was very fond of the Pope, sent a herald to the \nKing of France, to say that he must not make war upon that holy \npersonage, because he was the father of all Christians.  As the \nFrench King did not mind this relationship in the least, and also \nrefused to admit a claim King Henry made to certain lands in \nFrance, war was declared between the two countries.  Not to perplex \nthis story with an account of the tricks and designs of all the \nsovereigns who were engaged in it, it is enough to say that England \nmade a blundering alliance with Spain, and got stupidly taken in by \nthat country; which made its own terms with France when it could \nand left England in the lurch.  SIR EDWARD HOWARD, a bold admiral, \nson of the Earl of Surrey, distinguished himself by his bravery \nagainst the French in this business; but, unfortunately, he was \nmore brave than wise, for, skimming into the French harbour of \nBrest with only a few row-boats, he attempted (in revenge for the \ndefeat and death of SIR THOMAS KNYVETT, another bold English \nadmiral) to take some strong French ships, well defended with \nbatteries of cannon.  The upshot was, that he was left on board of \none of them (in consequence of its shooting away from his own \nboat), with not more than about a dozen men, and was thrown into \nthe sea and drowned:  though not until he had taken from his breast \nhis gold chain and gold whistle, which were the signs of his \noffice, and had cast them into the sea to prevent their being made \na boast of by the enemy.  After this defeat - which was a great \none, for Sir Edward Howard was a man of valour and fame - the King \ntook it into his head to invade France in person; first executing \nthat dangerous Earl of Suffolk whom his father had left in the \nTower, and appointing Queen Catherine to the charge of his kingdom \nin his absence.  He sailed to Calais, where he was joined by \nMAXIMILIAN, Emperor of Germany, who pretended to be his soldier, \nand who took pay in his service:  with a good deal of nonsense of \nthat sort, flattering enough to the vanity of a vain blusterer.  \nThe King might be successful enough in sham fights; but his idea of \nreal battles chiefly consisted in pitching silken tents of bright \ncolours that were ignominiously blown down by the wind, and in \nmaking a vast display of gaudy flags and golden curtains.  Fortune, \nhowever, favoured him better than he deserved; for, after much \nwaste of time in tent pitching, flag flying, gold curtaining, and \nother such masquerading, he gave the French battle at a place \ncalled Guinegate:  where they took such an unaccountable panic, and \nfled with such swiftness, that it was ever afterwards called by the \nEnglish the Battle of Spurs.  Instead of following up his \nadvantage, the King, finding that he had had enough of real \nfighting, came home again.\n\nThe Scottish King, though nearly related to Henry by marriage, had \ntaken part against him in this war.  The Earl of Surrey, as the \nEnglish general, advanced to meet him when he came out of his own \ndominions and crossed the river Tweed.  The two armies came up with \none another when the Scottish King had also crossed the river Till, \nand was encamped upon the last of the Cheviot Hills, called the \nHill of Flodden.  Along the plain below it, the English, when the \nhour of battle came, advanced.  The Scottish army, which had been \ndrawn up in five great bodies, then came steadily down in perfect \nsilence.  So they, in their turn, advanced to meet the English \narmy, which came on in one long line; and they attacked it with a \nbody of spearmen, under LORD HOME.  At first they had the best of \nit; but the English recovered themselves so bravely, and fought \nwith such valour, that, when the Scottish King had almost made his \nway up to the Royal Standard, he was slain, and the whole Scottish \npower routed.  Ten thousand Scottish men lay dead that day on \nFlodden Field; and among them, numbers of the nobility and gentry.  \nFor a long time afterwards, the Scottish peasantry used to believe \nthat their King had not been really killed in this battle, because \nno Englishman had found an iron belt he wore about his body as a \npenance for having been an unnatural and undutiful son.  But, \nwhatever became of his belt, the English had his sword and dagger, \nand the ring from his finger, and his body too, covered with \nwounds.  There is no doubt of it; for it was seen and recognised by \nEnglish gentlemen who had known the Scottish King well.\n\nWhen King Henry was making ready to renew the war in France, the \nFrench King was contemplating peace.  His queen, dying at this \ntime, he proposed, though he was upwards of fifty years old, to \nmarry King Henry\'s sister, the Princess Mary, who, besides being \nonly sixteen, was betrothed to the Duke of Suffolk.  As the \ninclinations of young Princesses were not much considered in such \nmatters, the marriage was concluded, and the poor girl was escorted \nto France, where she was immediately left as the French King\'s \nbride, with only one of all her English attendants.  That one was a \npretty young girl named ANNE BOLEYN, niece of the Earl of Surrey, \nwho had been made Duke of Norfolk, after the victory of Flodden \nField.  Anne Boleyn\'s is a name to be remembered, as you will \npresently find.\n\nAnd now the French King, who was very proud of his young wife, was \npreparing for many years of happiness, and she was looking forward, \nI dare say, to many years of misery, when he died within three \nmonths, and left her a young widow.  The new French monarch, \nFRANCIS THE FIRST, seeing how important it was to his interests \nthat she should take for her second husband no one but an \nEnglishman, advised her first lover, the Duke of Suffolk, when King \nHenry sent him over to France to fetch her home, to marry her.  The \nPrincess being herself so fond of that Duke, as to tell him that he \nmust either do so then, or for ever lose her, they were wedded; and \nHenry afterwards forgave them.  In making interest with the King, \nthe Duke of Suffolk had addressed his most powerful favourite and \nadviser, THOMAS WOLSEY - a name very famous in history for its rise \nand downfall.\n\nWolsey was the son of a respectable butcher at Ipswich, in Suffolk \nand received so excellent an education that he became a tutor to \nthe family of the Marquis of Dorset, who afterwards got him \nappointed one of the late King\'s chaplains.  On the accession of \nHenry the Eighth, he was promoted and taken into great favour.  He \nwas now Archbishop of York; the Pope had made him a Cardinal \nbesides; and whoever wanted influence in England or favour with the \nKing - whether he were a foreign monarch or an English nobleman - \nwas obliged to make a friend of the great Cardinal Wolsey.\n\nHe was a gay man, who could dance and jest, and sing and drink; and \nthose were the roads to so much, or rather so little, of a heart as \nKing Henry had.  He was wonderfully fond of pomp and glitter, and \nso was the King.  He knew a good deal of the Church learning of \nthat time; much of which consisted in finding artful excuses and \npretences for almost any wrong thing, and in arguing that black was \nwhite, or any other colour.  This kind of learning pleased the King \ntoo.  For many such reasons, the Cardinal was high in estimation \nwith the King; and, being a man of far greater ability, knew as \nwell how to manage him, as a clever keeper may know how to manage a \nwolf or a tiger, or any other cruel and uncertain beast, that may \nturn upon him and tear him any day.  Never had there been seen in \nEngland such state as my Lord Cardinal kept.  His wealth was \nenormous; equal, it was reckoned, to the riches of the Crown.  His \npalaces were as splendid as the King\'s, and his retinue was eight \nhundred strong.  He held his Court, dressed out from top to toe in \nflaming scarlet; and his very shoes were golden, set with precious \nstones.  His followers rode on blood horses; while he, with a \nwonderful affectation of humility in the midst of his great \nsplendour, ambled on a mule with a red velvet saddle and bridle and \ngolden stirrups.\n\nThrough the influence of this stately priest, a grand meeting was \narranged to take place between the French and English Kings in \nFrance; but on ground belonging to England.  A prodigious show of \nfriendship and rejoicing was to be made on the occasion; and \nheralds were sent to proclaim with brazen trumpets through all the \nprincipal cities of Europe, that, on a certain day, the Kings of \nFrance and England, as companions and brothers in arms, each \nattended by eighteen followers, would hold a tournament against all \nknights who might choose to come.\n\nCHARLES, the new Emperor of Germany (the old one being dead), \nwanted to prevent too cordial an alliance between these sovereigns, \nand came over to England before the King could repair to the place \nof meeting; and, besides making an agreeable impression upon him, \nsecured Wolsey\'s interest by promising that his influence should \nmake him Pope when the next vacancy occurred.  On the day when the \nEmperor left England, the King and all the Court went over to \nCalais, and thence to the place of meeting, between Ardres and \nGuisnes, commonly called the Field of the Cloth of Gold.  Here, all \nmanner of expense and prodigality was lavished on the decorations \nof the show; many of the knights and gentlemen being so superbly \ndressed that it was said they carried their whole estates upon \ntheir shoulders.\n\nThere were sham castles, temporary chapels, fountains running wine, \ngreat cellars full of wine free as water to all comers, silk tents, \ngold lace and foil, gilt lions, and such things without end; and, \nin the midst of all, the rich Cardinal out-shone and out-glittered \nall the noblemen and gentlemen assembled.  After a treaty made \nbetween the two Kings with as much solemnity as if they had \nintended to keep it, the lists - nine hundred feet long, and three \nhundred and twenty broad - were opened for the tournament; the \nQueens of France and England looking on with great array of lords \nand ladies.  Then, for ten days, the two sovereigns fought five \ncombats every day, and always beat their polite adversaries; though \nthey DO write that the King of England, being thrown in a wrestle \none day by the King of France, lost his kingly temper with his \nbrother-in-arms, and wanted to make a quarrel of it.  Then, there \nis a great story belonging to this Field of the Cloth of Gold, \nshowing how the English were distrustful of the French, and the \nFrench of the English, until Francis rode alone one morning to \nHenry\'s tent; and, going in before he was out of bed, told him in \njoke that he was his prisoner; and how Henry jumped out of bed and \nembraced Francis; and how Francis helped Henry to dress, and warmed \nhis linen for him; and how Henry gave Francis a splendid jewelled \ncollar, and how Francis gave Henry, in return, a costly bracelet.  \nAll this and a great deal more was so written about, and sung \nabout, and talked about at that time (and, indeed, since that time \ntoo), that the world has had good cause to be sick of it, for ever.\n\nOf course, nothing came of all these fine doings but a speedy \nrenewal of the war between England and France, in which the two \nRoyal companions and brothers in arms longed very earnestly to \ndamage one another.  But, before it broke out again, the Duke of \nBuckingham was shamefully executed on Tower Hill, on the evidence \nof a discharged servant - really for nothing, except the folly of \nhaving believed in a friar of the name of HOPKINS, who had \npretended to be a prophet, and who had mumbled and jumbled out some \nnonsense about the Duke\'s son being destined to be very great in \nthe land.  It was believed that the unfortunate Duke had given \noffence to the great Cardinal by expressing his mind freely about \nthe expense and absurdity of the whole business of the Field of the \nCloth of Gold.  At any rate, he was beheaded, as I have said, for \nnothing.  And the people who saw it done were very angry, and cried \nout that it was the work of \'the butcher\'s son!\'\n\nThe new war was a short one, though the Earl of Surrey invaded \nFrance again, and did some injury to that country.  It ended in \nanother treaty of peace between the two kingdoms, and in the \ndiscovery that the Emperor of Germany was not such a good friend to \nEngland in reality, as he pretended to be.  Neither did he keep his \npromise to Wolsey to make him Pope, though the King urged him.  Two \nPopes died in pretty quick succession; but the foreign priests were \ntoo much for the Cardinal, and kept him out of the post.  So the \nCardinal and King together found out that the Emperor of Germany \nwas not a man to keep faith with; broke off a projected marriage \nbetween the King\'s daughter MARY, Princess of Wales, and that \nsovereign; and began to consider whether it might not be well to \nmarry the young lady, either to Francis himself, or to his eldest \nson.\n\nThere now arose at Wittemberg, in Germany, the great leader of the \nmighty change in England which is called The Reformation, and which \nset the people free from their slavery to the priests.  This was a \nlearned Doctor, named MARTIN LUTHER, who knew all about them, for \nhe had been a priest, and even a monk, himself.  The preaching and \nwriting of Wickliffe had set a number of men thinking on this \nsubject; and Luther, finding one day to his great surprise, that \nthere really was a book called the New Testament which the priests \ndid not allow to be read, and which contained truths that they \nsuppressed, began to be very vigorous against the whole body, from \nthe Pope downward.  It happened, while he was yet only beginning \nhis vast work of awakening the nation, that an impudent fellow \nnamed TETZEL, a friar of very bad character, came into his \nneighbourhood selling what were called Indulgences, by wholesale, \nto raise money for beautifying the great Cathedral of St. Peter\'s, \nat Rome.  Whoever bought an Indulgence of the Pope was supposed to \nbuy himself off from the punishment of Heaven for his offences.  \nLuther told the people that these Indulgences were worthless bits \nof paper, before God, and that Tetzel and his masters were a crew \nof impostors in selling them.\n\nThe King and the Cardinal were mightily indignant at this \npresumption; and the King (with the help of SIR THOMAS MORE, a wise \nman, whom he afterwards repaid by striking off his head) even wrote \na book about it, with which the Pope was so well pleased that he \ngave the King the title of Defender of the Faith.  The King and the \nCardinal also issued flaming warnings to the people not to read \nLuther\'s books, on pain of excommunication.  But they did read them \nfor all that; and the rumour of what was in them spread far and \nwide.\n\nWhen this great change was thus going on, the King began to show \nhimself in his truest and worst colours.  Anne Boleyn, the pretty \nlittle girl who had gone abroad to France with his sister, was by \nthis time grown up to be very beautiful, and was one of the ladies \nin attendance on Queen Catherine.  Now, Queen Catherine was no \nlonger young or handsome, and it is likely that she was not \nparticularly good-tempered; having been always rather melancholy, \nand having been made more so by the deaths of four of her children \nwhen they were very young.  So, the King fell in love with the fair \nAnne Boleyn, and said to himself, \'How can I be best rid of my own \ntroublesome wife whom I am tired of, and marry Anne?\'\n\nYou recollect that Queen Catherine had been the wife of Henry\'s \nbrother.  What does the King do, after thinking it over, but calls \nhis favourite priests about him, and says, O! his mind is in such a \ndreadful state, and he is so frightfully uneasy, because he is \nafraid it was not lawful for him to marry the Queen!  Not one of \nthose priests had the courage to hint that it was rather curious he \nhad never thought of that before, and that his mind seemed to have \nbeen in a tolerably jolly condition during a great many years, in \nwhich he certainly had not fretted himself thin; but, they all \nsaid, Ah! that was very true, and it was a serious business; and \nperhaps the best way to make it right, would be for his Majesty to \nbe divorced!  The King replied, Yes, he thought that would be the \nbest way, certainly; so they all went to work.\n\nIf I were to relate to you the intrigues and plots that took place \nin the endeavour to get this divorce, you would think the History \nof England the most tiresome book in the world.  So I shall say no \nmore, than that after a vast deal of negotiation and evasion, the \nPope issued a commission to Cardinal Wolsey and CARDINAL CAMPEGGIO \n(whom he sent over from Italy for the purpose), to try the whole \ncase in England.  It is supposed - and I think with reason - that \nWolsey was the Queen\'s enemy, because she had reproved him for his \nproud and gorgeous manner of life.  But, he did not at first know \nthat the King wanted to marry Anne Boleyn; and when he did know it, \nhe even went down on his knees, in the endeavour to dissuade him.\n\nThe Cardinals opened their court in the Convent of the Black \nFriars, near to where the bridge of that name in London now stands; \nand the King and Queen, that they might be near it, took up their \nlodgings at the adjoining palace of Bridewell, of which nothing now \nremains but a bad prison.  On the opening of the court, when the \nKing and Queen were called on to appear, that poor ill-used lady, \nwith a dignity and firmness and yet with a womanly affection worthy \nto be always admired, went and kneeled at the King\'s feet, and said \nthat she had come, a stranger, to his dominions; that she had been \na good and true wife to him for twenty years; and that she could \nacknowledge no power in those Cardinals to try whether she should \nbe considered his wife after all that time, or should be put away.  \nWith that, she got up and left the court, and would never \nafterwards come back to it.\n\nThe King pretended to be very much overcome, and said, O! my lords \nand gentlemen, what a good woman she was to be sure, and how \ndelighted he would be to live with her unto death, but for that \nterrible uneasiness in his mind which was quite wearing him away!  \nSo, the case went on, and there was nothing but talk for two \nmonths.  Then Cardinal Campeggio, who, on behalf of the Pope, \nwanted nothing so much as delay, adjourned it for two more months; \nand before that time was elapsed, the Pope himself adjourned it \nindefinitely, by requiring the King and Queen to come to Rome and \nhave it tried there.  But by good luck for the King, word was \nbrought to him by some of his people, that they had happened to \nmeet at supper, THOMAS CRANMER, a learned Doctor of Cambridge, who \nhad proposed to urge the Pope on, by referring the case to all the \nlearned doctors and bishops, here and there and everywhere, and \ngetting their opinions that the King\'s marriage was unlawful.  The \nKing, who was now in a hurry to marry Anne Boleyn, thought this \nsuch a good idea, that he sent for Cranmer, post haste, and said to \nLORD ROCHFORT, Anne Boleyn\'s father, \'Take this learned Doctor down \nto your country-house, and there let him have a good room for a \nstudy, and no end of books out of which to prove that I may marry \nyour daughter.\'  Lord Rochfort, not at all reluctant, made the \nlearned Doctor as comfortable as he could; and the learned Doctor \nwent to work to prove his case.  All this time, the King and Anne \nBoleyn were writing letters to one another almost daily, full of \nimpatience to have the case settled; and Anne Boleyn was showing \nherself (as I think) very worthy of the fate which afterwards befel \nher.\n\nIt was bad for Cardinal Wolsey that he had left Cranmer to render \nthis help.  It was worse for him that he had tried to dissuade the \nKing from marrying Anne Boleyn.  Such a servant as he, to such a \nmaster as Henry, would probably have fallen in any case; but, \nbetween the hatred of the party of the Queen that was, and the \nhatred of the party of the Queen that was to be, he fell suddenly \nand heavily.  Going down one day to the Court of Chancery, where he \nnow presided, he was waited upon by the Dukes of Norfolk and \nSuffolk, who told him that they brought an order to him to resign \nthat office, and to withdraw quietly to a house he had at Esher, in \nSurrey.  The Cardinal refusing, they rode off to the King; and next \nday came back with a letter from him, on reading which, the \nCardinal submitted.  An inventory was made out of all the riches in \nhis palace at York Place (now Whitehall), and he went sorrowfully \nup the river, in his barge, to Putney.  An abject man he was, in \nspite of his pride; for being overtaken, riding out of that place \ntowards Esher, by one of the King\'s chamberlains who brought him a \nkind message and a ring, he alighted from his mule, took off his \ncap, and kneeled down in the dirt.  His poor Fool, whom in his \nprosperous days he had always kept in his palace to entertain him, \ncut a far better figure than he; for, when the Cardinal said to the \nchamberlain that he had nothing to send to his lord the King as a \npresent, but that jester who was a most excellent one, it took six \nstrong yeomen to remove the faithful fool from his master.\n\nThe once proud Cardinal was soon further disgraced, and wrote the \nmost abject letters to his vile sovereign; who humbled him one day \nand encouraged him the next, according to his humour, until he was \nat last ordered to go and reside in his diocese of York.  He said \nhe was too poor; but I don\'t know how he made that out, for he took \na hundred and sixty servants with him, and seventy-two cart-loads \nof furniture, food, and wine.  He remained in that part of the \ncountry for the best part of a year, and showed himself so improved \nby his misfortunes, and was so mild and so conciliating, that he \nwon all hearts.  And indeed, even in his proud days, he had done \nsome magnificent things for learning and education.  At last, he \nwas arrested for high treason; and, coming slowly on his journey \ntowards London, got as far as Leicester.  Arriving at Leicester \nAbbey after dark, and very ill, he said - when the monks came out \nat the gate with lighted torches to receive him - that he had come \nto lay his bones among them.  He had indeed; for he was taken to a \nbed, from which he never rose again.  His last words were, \'Had I \nbut served God as diligently as I have served the King, He would \nnot have given me over, in my grey hairs.  Howbeit, this is my just \nreward for my pains and diligence, not regarding my service to God, \nbut only my duty to my prince.\'  The news of his death was quickly \ncarried to the King, who was amusing himself with archery in the \ngarden of the magnificent Palace at Hampton Court, which that very \nWolsey had presented to him.  The greatest emotion his royal mind \ndisplayed at the loss of a servant so faithful and so ruined, was a \nparticular desire to lay hold of fifteen hundred pounds which the \nCardinal was reported to have hidden somewhere.\n\nThe opinions concerning the divorce, of the learned doctors and \nbishops and others, being at last collected, and being generally in \nthe King\'s favour, were forwarded to the Pope, with an entreaty \nthat he would now grant it.  The unfortunate Pope, who was a timid \nman, was half distracted between his fear of his authority being \nset aside in England if he did not do as he was asked, and his \ndread of offending the Emperor of Germany, who was Queen \nCatherine\'s nephew.  In this state of mind he still evaded and did \nnothing.  Then, THOMAS CROMWELL, who had been one of Wolsey\'s \nfaithful attendants, and had remained so even in his decline, \nadvised the King to take the matter into his own hands, and make \nhimself the head of the whole Church.  This, the King by various \nartful means, began to do; but he recompensed the clergy by \nallowing them to burn as many people as they pleased, for holding \nLuther\'s opinions.  You must understand that Sir Thomas More, the \nwise man who had helped the King with his book, had been made \nChancellor in Wolsey\'s place.  But, as he was truly attached to the \nChurch as it was even in its abuses, he, in this state of things, \nresigned.\n\nBeing now quite resolved to get rid of Queen Catherine, and to \nmarry Anne Boleyn without more ado, the King made Cranmer \nArchbishop of Canterbury, and directed Queen Catherine to leave the \nCourt.  She obeyed; but replied that wherever she went, she was \nQueen of England still, and would remain so, to the last.  The King \nthen married Anne Boleyn privately; and the new Archbishop of \nCanterbury, within half a year, declared his marriage with Queen \nCatherine void, and crowned Anne Boleyn Queen.\n\nShe might have known that no good could ever come from such wrong, \nand that the corpulent brute who had been so faithless and so cruel \nto his first wife, could be more faithless and more cruel to his \nsecond.  She might have known that, even when he was in love with \nher, he had been a mean and selfish coward, running away, like a \nfrightened cur, from her society and her house, when a dangerous \nsickness broke out in it, and when she might easily have taken it \nand died, as several of the household did.  But, Anne Boleyn \narrived at all this knowledge too late, and bought it at a dear \nprice.  Her bad marriage with a worse man came to its natural end.  \nIts natural end was not, as we shall too soon see, a natural death \nfor her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE EIGHTH\n\n\n\nPART THE SECOND\n\n\nTHE Pope was thrown into a very angry state of mind when he heard \nof the King\'s marriage, and fumed exceedingly.  Many of the English \nmonks and friars, seeing that their order was in danger, did the \nsame; some even declaimed against the King in church before his \nface, and were not to be stopped until he himself roared out \n\'Silence!\'  The King, not much the worse for this, took it pretty \nquietly; and was very glad when his Queen gave birth to a daughter, \nwho was christened ELIZABETH, and declared Princess of Wales as her \nsister Mary had already been.\n\nOne of the most atrocious features of this reign was that Henry the \nEighth was always trimming between the reformed religion and the \nunreformed one; so that the more he quarrelled with the Pope, the \nmore of his own subjects he roasted alive for not holding the \nPope\'s opinions.  Thus, an unfortunate student named John Frith, \nand a poor simple tailor named Andrew Hewet who loved him very \nmuch, and said that whatever John Frith believed HE believed, were \nburnt in Smithfield - to show what a capital Christian the King \nwas.\n\nBut, these were speedily followed by two much greater victims, Sir \nThomas More, and John Fisher, the Bishop of Rochester.  The latter, \nwho was a good and amiable old man, had committed no greater \noffence than believing in Elizabeth Barton, called the Maid of Kent \n- another of those ridiculous women who pretended to be inspired, \nand to make all sorts of heavenly revelations, though they indeed \nuttered nothing but evil nonsense.  For this offence - as it was \npretended, but really for denying the King to be the supreme Head \nof the Church - he got into trouble, and was put in prison; but, \neven then, he might have been suffered to die naturally (short work \nhaving been made of executing the Kentish Maid and her principal \nfollowers), but that the Pope, to spite the King, resolved to make \nhim a cardinal.  Upon that the King made a ferocious joke to the \neffect that the Pope might send Fisher a red hat - which is the way \nthey make a cardinal - but he should have no head on which to wear \nit; and he was tried with all unfairness and injustice, and \nsentenced to death.  He died like a noble and virtuous old man, and \nleft a worthy name behind him.  The King supposed, I dare say, that \nSir Thomas More would be frightened by this example; but, as he was \nnot to be easily terrified, and, thoroughly believing in the Pope, \nhad made up his mind that the King was not the rightful Head of the \nChurch, he positively refused to say that he was.  For this crime \nhe too was tried and sentenced, after having been in prison a whole \nyear.  When he was doomed to death, and came away from his trial \nwith the edge of the executioner\'s axe turned towards him - as was \nalways done in those times when a state prisoner came to that \nhopeless pass - he bore it quite serenely, and gave his blessing to \nhis son, who pressed through the crowd in Westminster Hall and \nkneeled down to receive it.  But, when he got to the Tower Wharf on \nhis way back to his prison, and his favourite daughter, MARGARET \nROPER, a very good woman, rushed through the guards again and \nagain, to kiss him and to weep upon his neck, he was overcome at \nlast.  He soon recovered, and never more showed any feeling but \ncheerfulness and courage.  When he was going up the steps of the \nscaffold to his death, he said jokingly to the Lieutenant of the \nTower, observing that they were weak and shook beneath his tread, \n\'I pray you, master Lieutenant, see me safe up; and, for my coming \ndown, I can shift for myself.\'  Also he said to the executioner, \nafter he had laid his head upon the block, \'Let me put my beard out \nof the way; for that, at least, has never committed any treason.\'  \nThen his head was struck off at a blow.  These two executions were \nworthy of King Henry the Eighth.  Sir Thomas More was one of the \nmost virtuous men in his dominions, and the Bishop was one of his \noldest and truest friends.  But to be a friend of that fellow was \nalmost as dangerous as to be his wife.\n\nWhen the news of these two murders got to Rome, the Pope raged \nagainst the murderer more than ever Pope raged since the world \nbegan, and prepared a Bull, ordering his subjects to take arms \nagainst him and dethrone him.  The King took all possible \nprecautions to keep that document out of his dominions, and set to \nwork in return to suppress a great number of the English \nmonasteries and abbeys.\n\nThis destruction was begun by a body of commissioners, of whom \nCromwell (whom the King had taken into great favour) was the head; \nand was carried on through some few years to its entire completion.  \nThere is no doubt that many of these religious establishments were \nreligious in nothing but in name, and were crammed with lazy, \nindolent, and sensual monks.  There is no doubt that they imposed \nupon the people in every possible way; that they had images moved \nby wires, which they pretended were miraculously moved by Heaven; \nthat they had among them a whole tun measure full of teeth, all \npurporting to have come out of the head of one saint, who must \nindeed have been a very extraordinary person with that enormous \nallowance of grinders; that they had bits of coal which they said \nhad fried Saint Lawrence, and bits of toe-nails which they said \nbelonged to other famous saints; penknives, and boots, and girdles, \nwhich they said belonged to others; and that all these bits of \nrubbish were called Relics, and adored by the ignorant people.  \nBut, on the other hand, there is no doubt either, that the King\'s \nofficers and men punished the good monks with the bad; did great \ninjustice; demolished many beautiful things and many valuable \nlibraries; destroyed numbers of paintings, stained glass windows, \nfine pavements, and carvings; and that the whole court were \nravenously greedy and rapacious for the division of this great \nspoil among them.  The King seems to have grown almost mad in the \nardour of this pursuit; for he declared Thomas a Becket a traitor, \nthough he had been dead so many years, and had his body dug up out \nof his grave.  He must have been as miraculous as the monks \npretended, if they had told the truth, for he was found with one \nhead on his shoulders, and they had shown another as his undoubted \nand genuine head ever since his death; it had brought them vast \nsums of money, too.  The gold and jewels on his shrine filled two \ngreat chests, and eight men tottered as they carried them away.  \nHow rich the monasteries were you may infer from the fact that, \nwhen they were all suppressed, one hundred and thirty thousand \npounds a year - in those days an immense sum - came to the Crown.\n\nThese things were not done without causing great discontent among \nthe people.  The monks had been good landlords and hospitable \nentertainers of all travellers, and had been accustomed to give \naway a great deal of corn, and fruit, and meat, and other things.  \nIn those days it was difficult to change goods into money, in \nconsequence of the roads being very few and very bad, and the \ncarts, and waggons of the worst description; and they must either \nhave given away some of the good things they possessed in enormous \nquantities, or have suffered them to spoil and moulder.  So, many \nof the people missed what it was more agreeable to get idly than to \nwork for; and the monks who were driven out of their homes and \nwandered about encouraged their discontent; and there were, \nconsequently, great risings in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.  These \nwere put down by terrific executions, from which the monks \nthemselves did not escape, and the King went on grunting and \ngrowling in his own fat way, like a Royal pig.\n\nI have told all this story of the religious houses at one time, to \nmake it plainer, and to get back to the King\'s domestic affairs.\n\nThe unfortunate Queen Catherine was by this time dead; and the King \nwas by this time as tired of his second Queen as he had been of his \nfirst.  As he had fallen in love with Anne when she was in the \nservice of Catherine, so he now fell in love with another lady in \nthe service of Anne.  See how wicked deeds are punished, and how \nbitterly and self-reproachfully the Queen must now have thought of \nher own rise to the throne!  The new fancy was a LADY JANE SEYMOUR; \nand the King no sooner set his mind on her, than he resolved to \nhave Anne Boleyn\'s head.  So, he brought a number of charges \nagainst Anne, accusing her of dreadful crimes which she had never \ncommitted, and implicating in them her own brother and certain \ngentlemen in her service:  among whom one Norris, and Mark Smeaton \na musician, are best remembered.  As the lords and councillors were \nas afraid of the King and as subservient to him as the meanest \npeasant in England was, they brought in Anne Boleyn guilty, and the \nother unfortunate persons accused with her, guilty too.  Those \ngentlemen died like men, with the exception of Smeaton, who had \nbeen tempted by the King into telling lies, which he called \nconfessions, and who had expected to be pardoned; but who, I am \nvery glad to say, was not.  There was then only the Queen to \ndispose of.  She had been surrounded in the Tower with women spies; \nhad been monstrously persecuted and foully slandered; and had \nreceived no justice.  But her spirit rose with her afflictions; \nand, after having in vain tried to soften the King by writing an \naffecting letter to him which still exists, \'from her doleful \nprison in the Tower,\' she resigned herself to death.  She said to \nthose about her, very cheerfully, that she had heard say the \nexecutioner was a good one, and that she had a little neck (she \nlaughed and clasped it with her hands as she said that), and would \nsoon be out of her pain.  And she WAS soon out of her pain, poor \ncreature, on the Green inside the Tower, and her body was flung \ninto an old box and put away in the ground under the chapel.\n\nThere is a story that the King sat in his palace listening very \nanxiously for the sound of the cannon which was to announce this \nnew murder; and that, when he heard it come booming on the air, he \nrose up in great spirits and ordered out his dogs to go a-hunting.  \nHe was bad enough to do it; but whether he did it or not, it is \ncertain that he married Jane Seymour the very next day.\n\nI have not much pleasure in recording that she lived just long \nenough to give birth to a son who was christened EDWARD, and then \nto die of a fever:  for, I cannot but think that any woman who \nmarried such a ruffian, and knew what innocent blood was on his \nhands, deserved the axe that would assuredly have fallen on the \nneck of Jane Seymour, if she had lived much longer.\n\nCranmer had done what he could to save some of the Church property \nfor purposes of religion and education; but, the great families had \nbeen so hungry to get hold of it, that very little could be rescued \nfor such objects.  Even MILES COVERDALE, who did the people the \ninestimable service of translating the Bible into English (which \nthe unreformed religion never permitted to be done), was left in \npoverty while the great families clutched the Church lands and \nmoney.  The people had been told that when the Crown came into \npossession of these funds, it would not be necessary to tax them; \nbut they were taxed afresh directly afterwards.  It was fortunate \nfor them, indeed, that so many nobles were so greedy for this \nwealth; since, if it had remained with the Crown, there might have \nbeen no end to tyranny for hundreds of years.  One of the most \nactive writers on the Church\'s side against the King was a member \nof his own family - a sort of distant cousin, REGINALD POLE by name \n- who attacked him in the most violent manner (though he received a \npension from him all the time), and fought for the Church with his \npen, day and night.  As he was beyond the King\'s reach - being in \nItaly - the King politely invited him over to discuss the subject; \nbut he, knowing better than to come, and wisely staying where he \nwas, the King\'s rage fell upon his brother Lord Montague, the \nMarquis of Exeter, and some other gentlemen:  who were tried for \nhigh treason in corresponding with him and aiding him - which they \nprobably did - and were all executed.  The Pope made Reginald Pole \na cardinal; but, so much against his will, that it is thought he \neven aspired in his own mind to the vacant throne of England, and \nhad hopes of marrying the Princess Mary.  His being made a high \npriest, however, put an end to all that.  His mother, the venerable \nCountess of Salisbury - who was, unfortunately for herself, within \nthe tyrant\'s reach - was the last of his relatives on whom his \nwrath fell.  When she was told to lay her grey head upon the block, \nshe answered the executioner, \'No!  My head never committed \ntreason, and if you want it, you shall seize it.\'  So, she ran \nround and round the scaffold with the executioner striking at her, \nand her grey hair bedabbled with blood; and even when they held her \ndown upon the block she moved her head about to the last, resolved \nto be no party to her own barbarous murder.  All this the people \nbore, as they had borne everything else.\n\nIndeed they bore much more; for the slow fires of Smithfield were \ncontinually burning, and people were constantly being roasted to \ndeath - still to show what a good Christian the King was.  He \ndefied the Pope and his Bull, which was now issued, and had come \ninto England; but he burned innumerable people whose only offence \nwas that they differed from the Pope\'s religious opinions.  There \nwas a wretched man named LAMBERT, among others, who was tried for \nthis before the King, and with whom six bishops argued one after \nanother.  When he was quite exhausted (as well he might be, after \nsix bishops), he threw himself on the King\'s mercy; but the King \nblustered out that he had no mercy for heretics.  So, HE too fed \nthe fire.\n\nAll this the people bore, and more than all this yet.  The national \nspirit seems to have been banished from the kingdom at this time.  \nThe very people who were executed for treason, the very wives and \nfriends of the \'bluff\' King, spoke of him on the scaffold as a good \nprince, and a gentle prince - just as serfs in similar \ncircumstances have been known to do, under the Sultan and Bashaws \nof the East, or under the fierce old tyrants of Russia, who poured \nboiling and freezing water on them alternately, until they died.  \nThe Parliament were as bad as the rest, and gave the King whatever \nhe wanted; among other vile accommodations, they gave him new \npowers of murdering, at his will and pleasure, any one whom he \nmight choose to call a traitor.  But the worst measure they passed \nwas an Act of Six Articles, commonly called at the time \'the whip \nwith six strings;\' which punished offences against the Pope\'s \nopinions, without mercy, and enforced the very worst parts of the \nmonkish religion.  Cranmer would have modified it, if he could; \nbut, being overborne by the Romish party, had not the power.  As \none of the articles declared that priests should not marry, and as \nhe was married himself, he sent his wife and children into Germany, \nand began to tremble at his danger; none the less because he was, \nand had long been, the King\'s friend.  This whip of six strings was \nmade under the King\'s own eye.  It should never be forgotten of him \nhow cruelly he supported the worst of the Popish doctrines when \nthere was nothing to be got by opposing them.\n\nThis amiable monarch now thought of taking another wife.  He \nproposed to the French King to have some of the ladies of the \nFrench Court exhibited before him, that he might make his Royal \nchoice; but the French King answered that he would rather not have \nhis ladies trotted out to be shown like horses at a fair.  He \nproposed to the Dowager Duchess of Milan, who replied that she \nmight have thought of such a match if she had had two heads; but, \nthat only owning one, she must beg to keep it safe.  At last \nCromwell represented that there was a Protestant Princess in \nGermany - those who held the reformed religion were called \nProtestants, because their leaders had Protested against the abuses \nand impositions of the unreformed Church - named ANNE OF CLEVES, \nwho was beautiful, and would answer the purpose admirably.  The \nKing said was she a large woman, because he must have a fat wife?  \n\'O yes,\' said Cromwell; \'she was very large, just the thing.\'  On \nhearing this the King sent over his famous painter, Hans Holbein, \nto take her portrait.  Hans made her out to be so good-looking that \nthe King was satisfied, and the marriage was arranged.  But, \nwhether anybody had paid Hans to touch up the picture; or whether \nHans, like one or two other painters, flattered a princess in the \nordinary way of business, I cannot say:  all I know is, that when \nAnne came over and the King went to Rochester to meet her, and \nfirst saw her without her seeing him, he swore she was \'a great \nFlanders mare,\' and said he would never marry her.  Being obliged \nto do it now matters had gone so far, he would not give her the \npresents he had prepared, and would never notice her.  He never \nforgave Cromwell his part in the affair.  His downfall dates from \nthat time.\n\nIt was quickened by his enemies, in the interests of the unreformed \nreligion, putting in the King\'s way, at a state dinner, a niece of \nthe Duke of Norfolk, CATHERINE HOWARD, a young lady of fascinating \nmanners, though small in stature and not particularly beautiful.  \nFalling in love with her on the spot, the King soon divorced Anne \nof Cleves after making her the subject of much brutal talk, on \npretence that she had been previously betrothed to some one else - \nwhich would never do for one of his dignity - and married \nCatherine.  It is probable that on his wedding day, of all days in \nthe year, he sent his faithful Cromwell to the scaffold, and had \nhis head struck off.  He further celebrated the occasion by burning \nat one time, and causing to be drawn to the fire on the same \nhurdles, some Protestant prisoners for denying the Pope\'s \ndoctrines, and some Roman Catholic prisoners for denying his own \nsupremacy.  Still the people bore it, and not a gentleman in \nEngland raised his hand.\n\nBut, by a just retribution, it soon came out that Catherine Howard, \nbefore her marriage, had been really guilty of such crimes as the \nKing had falsely attributed to his second wife Anne Boleyn; so, \nagain the dreadful axe made the King a widower, and this Queen \npassed away as so many in that reign had passed away before her.  \nAs an appropriate pursuit under the circumstances, Henry then \napplied himself to superintending the composition of a religious \nbook called \'A necessary doctrine for any Christian Man.\'  He must \nhave been a little confused in his mind, I think, at about this \nperiod; for he was so false to himself as to be true to some one:  \nthat some one being Cranmer, whom the Duke of Norfolk and others of \nhis enemies tried to ruin; but to whom the King was steadfast, and \nto whom he one night gave his ring, charging him when he should \nfind himself, next day, accused of treason, to show it to the \ncouncil board.  This Cranmer did to the confusion of his enemies.  \nI suppose the King thought he might want him a little longer.\n\nHe married yet once more.  Yes, strange to say, he found in England \nanother woman who would become his wife, and she was CATHERINE \nPARR, widow of Lord Latimer.  She leaned towards the reformed \nreligion; and it is some comfort to know, that she tormented the \nKing considerably by arguing a variety of doctrinal points with him \non all possible occasions.  She had very nearly done this to her \nown destruction.  After one of these conversations the King in a \nvery black mood actually instructed GARDINER, one of his Bishops \nwho favoured the Popish opinions, to draw a bill of accusation \nagainst her, which would have inevitably brought her to the \nscaffold where her predecessors had died, but that one of her \nfriends picked up the paper of instructions which had been dropped \nin the palace, and gave her timely notice.  She fell ill with \nterror; but managed the King so well when he came to entrap her \ninto further statements - by saying that she had only spoken on \nsuch points to divert his mind and to get some information from his \nextraordinary wisdom - that he gave her a kiss and called her his \nsweetheart.  And, when the Chancellor came next day actually to \ntake her to the Tower, the King sent him about his business, and \nhonoured him with the epithets of a beast, a knave, and a fool.  So \nnear was Catherine Parr to the block, and so narrow was her escape!\n\nThere was war with Scotland in this reign, and a short clumsy war \nwith France for favouring Scotland; but, the events at home were so \ndreadful, and leave such an enduring stain on the country, that I \nneed say no more of what happened abroad.\n\nA few more horrors, and this reign is over.  There was a lady, ANNE \nASKEW, in Lincolnshire, who inclined to the Protestant opinions, \nand whose husband being a fierce Catholic, turned her out of his \nhouse.  She came to London, and was considered as offending against \nthe six articles, and was taken to the Tower, and put upon the rack \n- probably because it was hoped that she might, in her agony, \ncriminate some obnoxious persons; if falsely, so much the better.  \nShe was tortured without uttering a cry, until the Lieutenant of \nthe Tower would suffer his men to torture her no more; and then two \npriests who were present actually pulled off their robes, and \nturned the wheels of the rack with their own hands, so rending and \ntwisting and breaking her that she was afterwards carried to the \nfire in a chair.  She was burned with three others, a gentleman, a \nclergyman, and a tailor; and so the world went on.\n\nEither the King became afraid of the power of the Duke of Norfolk, \nand his son the Earl of Surrey, or they gave him some offence, but \nhe resolved to pull THEM down, to follow all the rest who were \ngone.  The son was tried first - of course for nothing - and \ndefended himself bravely; but of course he was found guilty, and of \ncourse he was executed.  Then his father was laid hold of, and left \nfor death too.\n\nBut the King himself was left for death by a Greater King, and the \nearth was to be rid of him at last.  He was now a swollen, hideous \nspectacle, with a great hole in his leg, and so odious to every \nsense that it was dreadful to approach him.  When he was found to \nbe dying, Cranmer was sent for from his palace at Croydon, and came \nwith all speed, but found him speechless.  Happily, in that hour he \nperished.  He was in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and the \nthirty-eighth of his reign.\n\nHenry the Eighth has been favoured by some Protestant writers, \nbecause the Reformation was achieved in his time.  But the mighty \nmerit of it lies with other men and not with him; and it can be \nrendered none the worse by this monster\'s crimes, and none the \nbetter by any defence of them.  The plain truth is, that he was a \nmost intolerable ruffian, a disgrace to human nature, and a blot of \nblood and grease upon the History of England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE SIXTH\n\n\n\nHENRY THE EIGHTH had made a will, appointing a council of sixteen \nto govern the kingdom for his son while he was under age (he was \nnow only ten years old), and another council of twelve to help \nthem.  The most powerful of the first council was the EARL OF \nHERTFORD, the young King\'s uncle, who lost no time in bringing his \nnephew with great state up to Enfield, and thence to the Tower.  It \nwas considered at the time a striking proof of virtue in the young \nKing that he was sorry for his father\'s death; but, as common \nsubjects have that virtue too, sometimes, we will say no more about \nit.\n\nThere was a curious part of the late King\'s will, requiring his \nexecutors to fulfil whatever promises he had made.  Some of the \ncourt wondering what these might be, the Earl of Hertford and the \nother noblemen interested, said that they were promises to advance \nand enrich THEM.  So, the Earl of Hertford made himself DUKE OF \nSOMERSET, and made his brother EDWARD SEYMOUR a baron; and there \nwere various similar promotions, all very agreeable to the parties \nconcerned, and very dutiful, no doubt, to the late King\'s memory.  \nTo be more dutiful still, they made themselves rich out of the \nChurch lands, and were very comfortable.  The new Duke of Somerset \ncaused himself to be declared PROTECTOR of the kingdom, and was, \nindeed, the King.\n\nAs young Edward the Sixth had been brought up in the principles of \nthe Protestant religion, everybody knew that they would be \nmaintained.  But Cranmer, to whom they were chiefly entrusted, \nadvanced them steadily and temperately.  Many superstitious and \nridiculous practices were stopped; but practices which were \nharmless were not interfered with.\n\nThe Duke of Somerset, the Protector, was anxious to have the young \nKing engaged in marriage to the young Queen of Scotland, in order \nto prevent that princess from making an alliance with any foreign \npower; but, as a large party in Scotland were unfavourable to this \nplan, he invaded that country.  His excuse for doing so was, that \nthe Border men - that is, the Scotch who lived in that part of the \ncountry where England and Scotland joined - troubled the English \nvery much.  But there were two sides to this question; for the \nEnglish Border men troubled the Scotch too; and, through many long \nyears, there were perpetual border quarrels which gave rise to \nnumbers of old tales and songs.  However, the Protector invaded \nScotland; and ARRAN, the Scottish Regent, with an army twice as \nlarge as his, advanced to meet him.  They encountered on the banks \nof the river Esk, within a few miles of Edinburgh; and there, after \na little skirmish, the Protector made such moderate proposals, in \noffering to retire if the Scotch would only engage not to marry \ntheir princess to any foreign prince, that the Regent thought the \nEnglish were afraid.  But in this he made a horrible mistake; for \nthe English soldiers on land, and the English sailors on the water, \nso set upon the Scotch, that they broke and fled, and more than ten \nthousand of them were killed.  It was a dreadful battle, for the \nfugitives were slain without mercy.  The ground for four miles, all \nthe way to Edinburgh, was strewn with dead men, and with arms, and \nlegs, and heads.  Some hid themselves in streams and were drowned; \nsome threw away their armour and were killed running, almost naked; \nbut in this battle of Pinkey the English lost only two or three \nhundred men.  They were much better clothed than the Scotch; at the \npoverty of whose appearance and country they were exceedingly \nastonished.\n\nA Parliament was called when Somerset came back, and it repealed \nthe whip with six strings, and did one or two other good things; \nthough it unhappily retained the punishment of burning for those \npeople who did not make believe to believe, in all religious \nmatters, what the Government had declared that they must and should \nbelieve.  It also made a foolish law (meant to put down beggars), \nthat any man who lived idly and loitered about for three days \ntogether, should be burned with a hot iron, made a slave, and wear \nan iron fetter.  But this savage absurdity soon came to an end, and \nwent the way of a great many other foolish laws.\n\nThe Protector was now so proud that he sat in Parliament before all \nthe nobles, on the right hand of the throne.  Many other noblemen, \nwho only wanted to be as proud if they could get a chance, became \nhis enemies of course; and it is supposed that he came back \nsuddenly from Scotland because he had received news that his \nbrother, LORD SEYMOUR, was becoming dangerous to him.  This lord \nwas now High Admiral of England; a very handsome man, and a great \nfavourite with the Court ladies - even with the young Princess \nElizabeth, who romped with him a little more than young princesses \nin these times do with any one.  He had married Catherine Parr, the \nlate King\'s widow, who was now dead; and, to strengthen his power, \nhe secretly supplied the young King with money.  He may even have \nengaged with some of his brother\'s enemies in a plot to carry the \nboy off.  On these and other accusations, at any rate, he was \nconfined in the Tower, impeached, and found guilty; his own \nbrother\'s name being - unnatural and sad to tell - the first signed \nto the warrant of his execution.  He was executed on Tower Hill, \nand died denying his treason.  One of his last proceedings in this \nworld was to write two letters, one to the Princess Elizabeth, and \none to the Princess Mary, which a servant of his took charge of, \nand concealed in his shoe.  These letters are supposed to have \nurged them against his brother, and to revenge his death.  What \nthey truly contained is not known; but there is no doubt that he \nhad, at one time, obtained great influence over the Princess \nElizabeth.\n\nAll this while, the Protestant religion was making progress.  The \nimages which the people had gradually come to worship, were removed \nfrom the churches; the people were informed that they need not \nconfess themselves to priests unless they chose; a common prayer-\nbook was drawn up in the English language, which all could \nunderstand, and many other improvements were made; still \nmoderately.  For Cranmer was a very moderate man, and even \nrestrained the Protestant clergy from violently abusing the \nunreformed religion - as they very often did, and which was not a \ngood example.  But the people were at this time in great distress.  \nThe rapacious nobility who had come into possession of the Church \nlands, were very bad landlords.  They enclosed great quantities of \nground for the feeding of sheep, which was then more profitable \nthan the growing of crops; and this increased the general distress.  \nSo the people, who still understood little of what was going on \nabout them, and still readily believed what the homeless monks told \nthem - many of whom had been their good friends in their better \ndays - took it into their heads that all this was owing to the \nreformed religion, and therefore rose, in many parts of the \ncountry.\n\nThe most powerful risings were in Devonshire and Norfolk.  In \nDevonshire, the rebellion was so strong that ten thousand men \nunited within a few days, and even laid siege to Exeter.  But LORD \nRUSSELL, coming to the assistance of the citizens who defended that \ntown, defeated the rebels; and, not only hanged the Mayor of one \nplace, but hanged the vicar of another from his own church steeple.  \nWhat with hanging and killing by the sword, four thousand of the \nrebels are supposed to have fallen in that one county.  In Norfolk \n(where the rising was more against the enclosure of open lands than \nagainst the reformed religion), the popular leader was a man named \nROBERT KET, a tanner of Wymondham.  The mob were, in the first \ninstance, excited against the tanner by one JOHN FLOWERDEW, a \ngentleman who owed him a grudge:  but the tanner was more than a \nmatch for the gentleman, since he soon got the people on his side, \nand established himself near Norwich with quite an army.  There was \na large oak-tree in that place, on a spot called Moushold Hill, \nwhich Ket named the Tree of Reformation; and under its green \nboughs, he and his men sat, in the midsummer weather, holding \ncourts of justice, and debating affairs of state.  They were even \nimpartial enough to allow some rather tiresome public speakers to \nget up into this Tree of Reformation, and point out their errors to \nthem, in long discourses, while they lay listening (not always \nwithout some grumbling and growling) in the shade below.  At last, \none sunny July day, a herald appeared below the tree, and \nproclaimed Ket and all his men traitors, unless from that moment \nthey dispersed and went home:  in which case they were to receive a \npardon.  But, Ket and his men made light of the herald and became \nstronger than ever, until the Earl of Warwick went after them with \na sufficient force, and cut them all to pieces.  A few were hanged, \ndrawn, and quartered, as traitors, and their limbs were sent into \nvarious country places to be a terror to the people.  Nine of them \nwere hanged upon nine green branches of the Oak of Reformation; and \nso, for the time, that tree may be said to have withered away.\n\nThe Protector, though a haughty man, had compassion for the real \ndistresses of the common people, and a sincere desire to help them.  \nBut he was too proud and too high in degree to hold even their \nfavour steadily; and many of the nobles always envied and hated \nhim, because they were as proud and not as high as he.  He was at \nthis time building a great Palace in the Strand:  to get the stone \nfor which he blew up church steeples with gunpowder, and pulled \ndown bishops\' houses:  thus making himself still more disliked.  At \nlength, his principal enemy, the Earl of Warwick - Dudley by name, \nand the son of that Dudley who had made himself so odious with \nEmpson, in the reign of Henry the Seventh - joined with seven other \nmembers of the Council against him, formed a separate Council; and, \nbecoming stronger in a few days, sent him to the Tower under \ntwenty-nine articles of accusation.  After being sentenced by the \nCouncil to the forfeiture of all his offices and lands, he was \nliberated and pardoned, on making a very humble submission.  He was \neven taken back into the Council again, after having suffered this \nfall, and married his daughter, LADY ANNE SEYMOUR, to Warwick\'s \neldest son.  But such a reconciliation was little likely to last, \nand did not outlive a year.  Warwick, having got himself made Duke \nof Northumberland, and having advanced the more important of his \nfriends, then finished the history by causing the Duke of Somerset \nand his friend LORD GREY, and others, to be arrested for treason, \nin having conspired to seize and dethrone the King.  They were also \naccused of having intended to seize the new Duke of Northumberland, \nwith his friends LORD NORTHAMPTON and LORD PEMBROKE; to murder them \nif they found need; and to raise the City to revolt.  All this the \nfallen Protector positively denied; except that he confessed to \nhaving spoken of the murder of those three noblemen, but having \nnever designed it.  He was acquitted of the charge of treason, and \nfound guilty of the other charges; so when the people - who \nremembered his having been their friend, now that he was disgraced \nand in danger, saw him come out from his trial with the axe turned \nfrom him - they thought he was altogether acquitted, and sent up a \nloud shout of joy.\n\nBut the Duke of Somerset was ordered to be beheaded on Tower Hill, \nat eight o\'clock in the morning, and proclamations were issued \nbidding the citizens keep at home until after ten.  They filled the \nstreets, however, and crowded the place of execution as soon as it \nwas light; and, with sad faces and sad hearts, saw the once \npowerful Protector ascend the scaffold to lay his head upon the \ndreadful block.  While he was yet saying his last words to them \nwith manly courage, and telling them, in particular, how it \ncomforted him, at that pass, to have assisted in reforming the \nnational religion, a member of the Council was seen riding up on \nhorseback.  They again thought that the Duke was saved by his \nbringing a reprieve, and again shouted for joy.  But the Duke \nhimself told them they were mistaken, and laid down his head and \nhad it struck off at a blow.\n\nMany of the bystanders rushed forward and steeped their \nhandkerchiefs in his blood, as a mark of their affection.  He had, \nindeed, been capable of many good acts, and one of them was \ndiscovered after he was no more.  The Bishop of Durham, a very good \nman, had been informed against to the Council, when the Duke was in \npower, as having answered a treacherous letter proposing a \nrebellion against the reformed religion.  As the answer could not \nbe found, he could not be declared guilty; but it was now \ndiscovered, hidden by the Duke himself among some private papers, \nin his regard for that good man.  The Bishop lost his office, and \nwas deprived of his possessions.\n\nIt is not very pleasant to know that while his uncle lay in prison \nunder sentence of death, the young King was being vastly \nentertained by plays, and dances, and sham fights:  but there is no \ndoubt of it, for he kept a journal himself.  It is pleasanter to \nknow that not a single Roman Catholic was burnt in this reign for \nholding that religion; though two wretched victims suffered for \nheresy.  One, a woman named JOAN BOCHER, for professing some \nopinions that even she could only explain in unintelligible jargon.  \nThe other, a Dutchman, named VON PARIS, who practised as a surgeon \nin London.  Edward was, to his credit, exceedingly unwilling to \nsign the warrant for the woman\'s execution:  shedding tears before \nhe did so, and telling Cranmer, who urged him to do it (though \nCranmer really would have spared the woman at first, but for her \nown determined obstinacy), that the guilt was not his, but that of \nthe man who so strongly urged the dreadful act.  We shall see, too \nsoon, whether the time ever came when Cranmer is likely to have \nremembered this with sorrow and remorse.\n\nCranmer and RIDLEY (at first Bishop of Rochester, and afterwards \nBishop of London) were the most powerful of the clergy of this \nreign.  Others were imprisoned and deprived of their property for \nstill adhering to the unreformed religion; the most important among \nwhom were GARDINER Bishop of Winchester, HEATH Bishop of Worcester, \nDAY Bishop of Chichester, and BONNER that Bishop of London who was \nsuperseded by Ridley.  The Princess Mary, who inherited her \nmother\'s gloomy temper, and hated the reformed religion as \nconnected with her mother\'s wrongs and sorrows - she knew nothing \nelse about it, always refusing to read a single book in which it \nwas truly described - held by the unreformed religion too, and was \nthe only person in the kingdom for whom the old Mass was allowed to \nbe performed; nor would the young King have made that exception \neven in her favour, but for the strong persuasions of Cranmer and \nRidley.  He always viewed it with horror; and when he fell into a \nsickly condition, after having been very ill, first of the measles \nand then of the small-pox, he was greatly troubled in mind to think \nthat if he died, and she, the next heir to the throne, succeeded, \nthe Roman Catholic religion would be set up again.\n\nThis uneasiness, the Duke of Northumberland was not slow to \nencourage:  for, if the Princess Mary came to the throne, he, who \nhad taken part with the Protestants, was sure to be disgraced.  \nNow, the Duchess of Suffolk was descended from King Henry the \nSeventh; and, if she resigned what little or no right she had, in \nfavour of her daughter LADY JANE GREY, that would be the succession \nto promote the Duke\'s greatness; because LORD GUILFORD DUDLEY, one \nof his sons, was, at this very time, newly married to her.  So, he \nworked upon the King\'s fears, and persuaded him to set aside both \nthe Princess Mary and the Princess Elizabeth, and assert his right \nto appoint his successor.  Accordingly the young King handed to the \nCrown lawyers a writing signed half a dozen times over by himself, \nappointing Lady Jane Grey to succeed to the Crown, and requiring \nthem to have his will made out according to law.  They were much \nagainst it at first, and told the King so; but the Duke of \nNorthumberland - being so violent about it that the lawyers even \nexpected him to beat them, and hotly declaring that, stripped to \nhis shirt, he would fight any man in such a quarrel - they yielded.  \nCranmer, also, at first hesitated; pleading that he had sworn to \nmaintain the succession of the Crown to the Princess Mary; but, he \nwas a weak man in his resolutions, and afterwards signed the \ndocument with the rest of the council.\n\nIt was completed none too soon; for Edward was now sinking in a \nrapid decline; and, by way of making him better, they handed him \nover to a woman-doctor who pretended to be able to cure it.  He \nspeedily got worse.  On the sixth of July, in the year one thousand \nfive hundred and fifty-three, he died, very peaceably and piously, \npraying God, with his last breath, to protect the reformed \nreligion.\n\nThis King died in the sixteenth year of his age, and in the seventh \nof his reign.  It is difficult to judge what the character of one \nso young might afterwards have become among so many bad, ambitious, \nquarrelling nobles.  But, he was an amiable boy, of very good \nabilities, and had nothing coarse or cruel or brutal in his \ndisposition - which in the son of such a father is rather \nsurprising.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX - ENGLAND UNDER MARY\n\n\n\nTHE Duke of Northumberland was very anxious to keep the young \nKing\'s death a secret, in order that he might get the two \nPrincesses into his power.  But, the Princess Mary, being informed \nof that event as she was on her way to London to see her sick \nbrother, turned her horse\'s head, and rode away into Norfolk.  The \nEarl of Arundel was her friend, and it was he who sent her warning \nof what had happened.\n\nAs the secret could not be kept, the Duke of Northumberland and the \ncouncil sent for the Lord Mayor of London and some of the aldermen, \nand made a merit of telling it to them.  Then, they made it known \nto the people, and set off to inform Lady Jane Grey that she was to \nbe Queen.\n\nShe was a pretty girl of only sixteen, and was amiable, learned, \nand clever.  When the lords who came to her, fell on their knees \nbefore her, and told her what tidings they brought, she was so \nastonished that she fainted.  On recovering, she expressed her \nsorrow for the young King\'s death, and said that she knew she was \nunfit to govern the kingdom; but that if she must be Queen, she \nprayed God to direct her.  She was then at Sion House, near \nBrentford; and the lords took her down the river in state to the \nTower, that she might remain there (as the custom was) until she \nwas crowned.  But the people were not at all favourable to Lady \nJane, considering that the right to be Queen was Mary\'s, and \ngreatly disliking the Duke of Northumberland.  They were not put \ninto a better humour by the Duke\'s causing a vintner\'s servant, one \nGabriel Pot, to be taken up for expressing his dissatisfaction \namong the crowd, and to have his ears nailed to the pillory, and \ncut off.  Some powerful men among the nobility declared on Mary\'s \nside.  They raised troops to support her cause, had her proclaimed \nQueen at Norwich, and gathered around her at the castle of \nFramlingham, which belonged to the Duke of Norfolk.  For, she was \nnot considered so safe as yet, but that it was best to keep her in \na castle on the sea-coast, from whence she might be sent abroad, if \nnecessary.\n\nThe Council would have despatched Lady Jane\'s father, the Duke of \nSuffolk, as the general of the army against this force; but, as \nLady Jane implored that her father might remain with her, and as he \nwas known to be but a weak man, they told the Duke of \nNorthumberland that he must take the command himself.  He was not \nvery ready to do so, as he mistrusted the Council much; but there \nwas no help for it, and he set forth with a heavy heart, observing \nto a lord who rode beside him through Shoreditch at the head of the \ntroops, that, although the people pressed in great numbers to look \nat them, they were terribly silent.\n\nAnd his fears for himself turned out to be well founded.  While he \nwas waiting at Cambridge for further help from the Council, the \nCouncil took it into their heads to turn their backs on Lady Jane\'s \ncause, and to take up the Princess Mary\'s.  This was chiefly owing \nto the before-mentioned Earl of Arundel, who represented to the \nLord Mayor and aldermen, in a second interview with those sagacious \npersons, that, as for himself, he did not perceive the Reformed \nreligion to be in much danger - which Lord Pembroke backed by \nflourishing his sword as another kind of persuasion.  The Lord \nMayor and aldermen, thus enlightened, said there could be no doubt \nthat the Princess Mary ought to be Queen.  So, she was proclaimed \nat the Cross by St. Paul\'s, and barrels of wine were given to the \npeople, and they got very drunk, and danced round blazing bonfires \n- little thinking, poor wretches, what other bonfires would soon be \nblazing in Queen Mary\'s name.\n\nAfter a ten days\' dream of royalty, Lady Jane Grey resigned the \nCrown with great willingness, saying that she had only accepted it \nin obedience to her father and mother; and went gladly back to her \npleasant house by the river, and her books.  Mary then came on \ntowards London; and at Wanstead in Essex, was joined by her half-\nsister, the Princess Elizabeth.  They passed through the streets of \nLondon to the Tower, and there the new Queen met some eminent \nprisoners then confined in it, kissed them, and gave them their \nliberty.  Among these was that Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, who \nhad been imprisoned in the last reign for holding to the unreformed \nreligion.  Him she soon made chancellor.\n\nThe Duke of Northumberland had been taken prisoner, and, together \nwith his son and five others, was quickly brought before the \nCouncil.  He, not unnaturally, asked that Council, in his defence, \nwhether it was treason to obey orders that had been issued under \nthe great seal; and, if it were, whether they, who had obeyed them \ntoo, ought to be his judges?  But they made light of these points; \nand, being resolved to have him out of the way, soon sentenced him \nto death.  He had risen into power upon the death of another man, \nand made but a poor show (as might be expected) when he himself lay \nlow.  He entreated Gardiner to let him live, if it were only in a \nmouse\'s hole; and, when he ascended the scaffold to be beheaded on \nTower Hill, addressed the people in a miserable way, saying that he \nhad been incited by others, and exhorting them to return to the \nunreformed religion, which he told them was his faith.  There seems \nreason to suppose that he expected a pardon even then, in return \nfor this confession; but it matters little whether he did or not.  \nHis head was struck off.\n\nMary was now crowned Queen.  She was thirty-seven years of age, \nshort and thin, wrinkled in the face, and very unhealthy.  But she \nhad a great liking for show and for bright colours, and all the \nladies of her Court were magnificently dressed.  She had a great \nliking too for old customs, without much sense in them; and she was \noiled in the oldest way, and blessed in the oldest way, and done \nall manner of things to in the oldest way, at her coronation.  I \nhope they did her good.\n\nShe soon began to show her desire to put down the Reformed \nreligion, and put up the unreformed one:  though it was dangerous \nwork as yet, the people being something wiser than they used to be.  \nThey even cast a shower of stones - and among them a dagger - at \none of the royal chaplains who attacked the Reformed religion in a \npublic sermon.  But the Queen and her priests went steadily on.  \nRidley, the powerful bishop of the last reign, was seized and sent \nto the Tower.  LATIMER, also celebrated among the Clergy of the \nlast reign, was likewise sent to the Tower, and Cranmer speedily \nfollowed.  Latimer was an aged man; and, as his guards took him \nthrough Smithfield, he looked round it, and said, \'This is a place \nthat hath long groaned for me.\'  For he knew well, what kind of \nbonfires would soon be burning.  Nor was the knowledge confined to \nhim.  The prisons were fast filled with the chief Protestants, who \nwere there left rotting in darkness, hunger, dirt, and separation \nfrom their friends; many, who had time left them for escape, fled \nfrom the kingdom; and the dullest of the people began, now, to see \nwhat was coming.\n\nIt came on fast.  A Parliament was got together; not without strong \nsuspicion of unfairness; and they annulled the divorce, formerly \npronounced by Cranmer between the Queen\'s mother and King Henry the \nEighth, and unmade all the laws on the subject of religion that had \nbeen made in the last King Edward\'s reign.  They began their \nproceedings, in violation of the law, by having the old mass said \nbefore them in Latin, and by turning out a bishop who would not \nkneel down.  They also declared guilty of treason, Lady Jane Grey \nfor aspiring to the Crown; her husband, for being her husband; and \nCranmer, for not believing in the mass aforesaid.  They then prayed \nthe Queen graciously to choose a husband for herself, as soon as \nmight be.\n\nNow, the question who should be the Queen\'s husband had given rise \nto a great deal of discussion, and to several contending parties.  \nSome said Cardinal Pole was the man - but the Queen was of opinion \nthat he was NOT the man, he being too old and too much of a \nstudent.  Others said that the gallant young COURTENAY, whom the \nQueen had made Earl of Devonshire, was the man - and the Queen \nthought so too, for a while; but she changed her mind.  At last it \nappeared that PHILIP, PRINCE OF SPAIN, was certainly the man - \nthough certainly not the people\'s man; for they detested the idea \nof such a marriage from the beginning to the end, and murmured that \nthe Spaniard would establish in England, by the aid of foreign \nsoldiers, the worst abuses of the Popish religion, and even the \nterrible Inquisition itself.\n\nThese discontents gave rise to a conspiracy for marrying young \nCourtenay to the Princess Elizabeth, and setting them up, with \npopular tumults all over the kingdom, against the Queen.  This was \ndiscovered in time by Gardiner; but in Kent, the old bold county, \nthe people rose in their old bold way.  SIR THOMAS WYAT, a man of \ngreat daring, was their leader.  He raised his standard at \nMaidstone, marched on to Rochester, established himself in the old \ncastle there, and prepared to hold out against the Duke of Norfolk, \nwho came against him with a party of the Queen\'s guards, and a body \nof five hundred London men.  The London men, however, were all for \nElizabeth, and not at all for Mary.  They declared, under the \ncastle walls, for Wyat; the Duke retreated; and Wyat came on to \nDeptford, at the head of fifteen thousand men.\n\nBut these, in their turn, fell away.  When he came to Southwark, \nthere were only two thousand left.  Not dismayed by finding the \nLondon citizens in arms, and the guns at the Tower ready to oppose \nhis crossing the river there, Wyat led them off to Kingston-upon-\nThames, intending to cross the bridge that he knew to be in that \nplace, and so to work his way round to Ludgate, one of the old \ngates of the City.  He found the bridge broken down, but mended it, \ncame across, and bravely fought his way up Fleet Street to Ludgate \nHill.  Finding the gate closed against him, he fought his way back \nagain, sword in hand, to Temple Bar.  Here, being overpowered, he \nsurrendered himself, and three or four hundred of his men were \ntaken, besides a hundred killed.  Wyat, in a moment of weakness \n(and perhaps of torture) was afterwards made to accuse the Princess \nElizabeth as his accomplice to some very small extent.  But his \nmanhood soon returned to him, and he refused to save his life by \nmaking any more false confessions.  He was quartered and \ndistributed in the usual brutal way, and from fifty to a hundred of \nhis followers were hanged.  The rest were led out, with halters \nround their necks, to be pardoned, and to make a parade of crying \nout, \'God save Queen Mary!\'\n\nIn the danger of this rebellion, the Queen showed herself to be a \nwoman of courage and spirit.  She disdained to retreat to any place \nof safety, and went down to the Guildhall, sceptre in hand, and \nmade a gallant speech to the Lord Mayor and citizens.  But on the \nday after Wyat\'s defeat, she did the most cruel act, even of her \ncruel reign, in signing the warrant for the execution of Lady Jane \nGrey.\n\nThey tried to persuade Lady Jane to accept the unreformed religion; \nbut she steadily refused.  On the morning when she was to die, she \nsaw from her window the bleeding and headless body of her husband \nbrought back in a cart from the scaffold on Tower Hill where he had \nlaid down his life.  But, as she had declined to see him before his \nexecution, lest she should be overpowered and not make a good end, \nso, she even now showed a constancy and calmness that will never be \nforgotten.  She came up to the scaffold with a firm step and a \nquiet face, and addressed the bystanders in a steady voice.  They \nwere not numerous; for she was too young, too innocent and fair, to \nbe murdered before the people on Tower Hill, as her husband had \njust been; so, the place of her execution was within the Tower \nitself.  She said that she had done an unlawful act in taking what \nwas Queen Mary\'s right; but that she had done so with no bad \nintent, and that she died a humble Christian.  She begged the \nexecutioner to despatch her quickly, and she asked him, \'Will you \ntake my head off before I lay me down?\'  He answered, \'No, Madam,\' \nand then she was very quiet while they bandaged her eyes.  Being \nblinded, and unable to see the block on which she was to lay her \nyoung head, she was seen to feel about for it with her hands, and \nwas heard to say, confused, \'O what shall I do!  Where is it?\'  \nThen they guided her to the right place, and the executioner struck \noff her head.  You know too well, now, what dreadful deeds the \nexecutioner did in England, through many, many years, and how his \naxe descended on the hateful block through the necks of some of the \nbravest, wisest, and best in the land.  But it never struck so \ncruel and so vile a blow as this.\n\nThe father of Lady Jane soon followed, but was little pitied.  \nQueen Mary\'s next object was to lay hold of Elizabeth, and this was \npursued with great eagerness.  Five hundred men were sent to her \nretired house at Ashridge, by Berkhampstead, with orders to bring \nher up, alive or dead.  They got there at ten at night, when she \nwas sick in bed.  But, their leaders followed her lady into her \nbedchamber, whence she was brought out betimes next morning, and \nput into a litter to be conveyed to London.  She was so weak and \nill, that she was five days on the road; still, she was so resolved \nto be seen by the people that she had the curtains of the litter \nopened; and so, very pale and sickly, passed through the streets.  \nShe wrote to her sister, saying she was innocent of any crime, and \nasking why she was made a prisoner; but she got no answer, and was \nordered to the Tower.  They took her in by the Traitor\'s Gate, to \nwhich she objected, but in vain.  One of the lords who conveyed her \noffered to cover her with his cloak, as it was raining, but she put \nit away from her, proudly and scornfully, and passed into the \nTower, and sat down in a court-yard on a stone.  They besought her \nto come in out of the wet; but she answered that it was better \nsitting there, than in a worse place.  At length she went to her \napartment, where she was kept a prisoner, though not so close a \nprisoner as at Woodstock, whither she was afterwards removed, and \nwhere she is said to have one day envied a milkmaid whom she heard \nsinging in the sunshine as she went through the green fields.  \nGardiner, than whom there were not many worse men among the fierce \nand sullen priests, cared little to keep secret his stern desire \nfor her death:  being used to say that it was of little service to \nshake off the leaves, and lop the branches of the tree of heresy, \nif its root, the hope of heretics, were left.  He failed, however, \nin his benevolent design.  Elizabeth was, at length, released; and \nHatfield House was assigned to her as a residence, under the care \nof one SIR THOMAS POPE.\n\nIt would seem that Philip, the Prince of Spain, was a main cause of \nthis change in Elizabeth\'s fortunes.  He was not an amiable man, \nbeing, on the contrary, proud, overbearing, and gloomy; but he and \nthe Spanish lords who came over with him, assuredly did \ndiscountenance the idea of doing any violence to the Princess.  It \nmay have been mere prudence, but we will hope it was manhood and \nhonour.  The Queen had been expecting her husband with great \nimpatience, and at length he came, to her great joy, though he \nnever cared much for her.  They were married by Gardiner, at \nWinchester, and there was more holiday-making among the people; but \nthey had their old distrust of this Spanish marriage, in which even \nthe Parliament shared.  Though the members of that Parliament were \nfar from honest, and were strongly suspected to have been bought \nwith Spanish money, they would pass no bill to enable the Queen to \nset aside the Princess Elizabeth and appoint her own successor.\n\nAlthough Gardiner failed in this object, as well as in the darker \none of bringing the Princess to the scaffold, he went on at a great \npace in the revival of the unreformed religion.  A new Parliament \nwas packed, in which there were no Protestants.  Preparations were \nmade to receive Cardinal Pole in England as the Pope\'s messenger, \nbringing his holy declaration that all the nobility who had \nacquired Church property, should keep it - which was done to enlist \ntheir selfish interest on the Pope\'s side.  Then a great scene was \nenacted, which was the triumph of the Queen\'s plans.  Cardinal Pole \narrived in great splendour and dignity, and was received with great \npomp.  The Parliament joined in a petition expressive of their \nsorrow at the change in the national religion, and praying him to \nreceive the country again into the Popish Church.  With the Queen \nsitting on her throne, and the King on one side of her, and the \nCardinal on the other, and the Parliament present, Gardiner read \nthe petition aloud.  The Cardinal then made a great speech, and was \nso obliging as to say that all was forgotten and forgiven, and that \nthe kingdom was solemnly made Roman Catholic again.\n\nEverything was now ready for the lighting of the terrible bonfires.  \nThe Queen having declared to the Council, in writing, that she \nwould wish none of her subjects to be burnt without some of the \nCouncil being present, and that she would particularly wish there \nto be good sermons at all burnings, the Council knew pretty well \nwhat was to be done next.  So, after the Cardinal had blessed all \nthe bishops as a preface to the burnings, the Chancellor Gardiner \nopened a High Court at Saint Mary Overy, on the Southwark side of \nLondon Bridge, for the trial of heretics.  Here, two of the late \nProtestant clergymen, HOOPER, Bishop of Gloucester, and ROGERS, a \nPrebendary of St. Paul\'s, were brought to be tried.  Hooper was \ntried first for being married, though a priest, and for not \nbelieving in the mass.  He admitted both of these accusations, and \nsaid that the mass was a wicked imposition.  Then they tried \nRogers, who said the same.  Next morning the two were brought up to \nbe sentenced; and then Rogers said that his poor wife, being a \nGerman woman and a stranger in the land, he hoped might be allowed \nto come to speak to him before he died.  To this the inhuman \nGardiner replied, that she was not his wife.  \'Yea, but she is, my \nlord,\' said Rogers, \'and she hath been my wife these eighteen \nyears.\'  His request was still refused, and they were both sent to \nNewgate; all those who stood in the streets to sell things, being \nordered to put out their lights that the people might not see them.  \nBut, the people stood at their doors with candles in their hands, \nand prayed for them as they went by.  Soon afterwards, Rogers was \ntaken out of jail to be burnt in Smithfield; and, in the crowd as \nhe went along, he saw his poor wife and his ten children, of whom \nthe youngest was a little baby.  And so he was burnt to death.\n\nThe next day, Hooper, who was to be burnt at Gloucester, was \nbrought out to take his last journey, and was made to wear a hood \nover his face that he might not be known by the people.  But, they \ndid know him for all that, down in his own part of the country; \nand, when he came near Gloucester, they lined the road, making \nprayers and lamentations.  His guards took him to a lodging, where \nhe slept soundly all night.  At nine o\'clock next morning, he was \nbrought forth leaning on a staff; for he had taken cold in prison, \nand was infirm.  The iron stake, and the iron chain which was to \nbind him to it, were fixed up near a great elm-tree in a pleasant \nopen place before the cathedral, where, on peaceful Sundays, he had \nbeen accustomed to preach and to pray, when he was bishop of \nGloucester.  This tree, which had no leaves then, it being \nFebruary, was filled with people; and the priests of Gloucester \nCollege were looking complacently on from a window, and there was a \ngreat concourse of spectators in every spot from which a glimpse of \nthe dreadful sight could be beheld.  When the old man kneeled down \non the small platform at the foot of the stake, and prayed aloud, \nthe nearest people were observed to be so attentive to his prayers \nthat they were ordered to stand farther back; for it did not suit \nthe Romish Church to have those Protestant words heard.  His \nprayers concluded, he went up to the stake and was stripped to his \nshirt, and chained ready for the fire.  One of his guards had such \ncompassion on him that, to shorten his agonies, he tied some \npackets of gunpowder about him.  Then they heaped up wood and straw \nand reeds, and set them all alight.  But, unhappily, the wood was \ngreen and damp, and there was a wind blowing that blew what flame \nthere was, away.  Thus, through three-quarters of an hour, the good \nold man was scorched and roasted and smoked, as the fire rose and \nsank; and all that time they saw him, as he burned, moving his lips \nin prayer, and beating his breast with one hand, even after the \nother was burnt away and had fallen off.\n\nCranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, were taken to Oxford to dispute with \na commission of priests and doctors about the mass.  They were \nshamefully treated; and it is recorded that the Oxford scholars \nhissed and howled and groaned, and misconducted themselves in an \nanything but a scholarly way.  The prisoners were taken back to \njail, and afterwards tried in St. Mary\'s Church.  They were all \nfound guilty.  On the sixteenth of the month of October, Ridley and \nLatimer were brought out, to make another of the dreadful bonfires.\n\nThe scene of the suffering of these two good Protestant men was in \nthe City ditch, near Baliol College.  On coming to the dreadful \nspot, they kissed the stakes, and then embraced each other.  And \nthen a learned doctor got up into a pulpit which was placed there, \nand preached a sermon from the text, \'Though I give my body to be \nburned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\'  When you \nthink of the charity of burning men alive, you may imagine that \nthis learned doctor had a rather brazen face.  Ridley would have \nanswered his sermon when it came to an end, but was not allowed.  \nWhen Latimer was stripped, it appeared that he had dressed himself \nunder his other clothes, in a new shroud; and, as he stood in it \nbefore all the people, it was noted of him, and long remembered, \nthat, whereas he had been stooping and feeble but a few minutes \nbefore, he now stood upright and handsome, in the knowledge that he \nwas dying for a just and a great cause.  Ridley\'s brother-in-law \nwas there with bags of gunpowder; and when they were both chained \nup, he tied them round their bodies.  Then, a light was thrown upon \nthe pile to fire it.  \'Be of good comfort, Master Ridley,\' said \nLatimer, at that awful moment, \'and play the man!  We shall this \nday light such a candle, by God\'s grace, in England, as I trust \nshall never be put out.\'  And then he was seen to make motions with \nhis hands as if he were washing them in the flames, and to stroke \nhis aged face with them, and was heard to cry, \'Father of Heaven, \nreceive my soul!\'  He died quickly, but the fire, after having \nburned the legs of Ridley, sunk.  There he lingered, chained to the \niron post, and crying, \'O!  I cannot burn!  O! for Christ\'s sake \nlet the fire come unto me!\'  And still, when his brother-in-law had \nheaped on more wood, he was heard through the blinding smoke, still \ndismally crying, \'O!  I cannot burn, I cannot burn!\'  At last, the \ngunpowder caught fire, and ended his miseries.\n\nFive days after this fearful scene, Gardiner went to his tremendous \naccount before God, for the cruelties he had so much assisted in \ncommitting.\n\nCranmer remained still alive and in prison.  He was brought out \nagain in February, for more examining and trying, by Bonner, Bishop \nof London:  another man of blood, who had succeeded to Gardiner\'s \nwork, even in his lifetime, when Gardiner was tired of it.  Cranmer \nwas now degraded as a priest, and left for death; but, if the Queen \nhated any one on earth, she hated him, and it was resolved that he \nshould be ruined and disgraced to the utmost.  There is no doubt \nthat the Queen and her husband personally urged on these deeds, \nbecause they wrote to the Council, urging them to be active in the \nkindling of the fearful fires.  As Cranmer was known not to be a \nfirm man, a plan was laid for surrounding him with artful people, \nand inducing him to recant to the unreformed religion.  Deans and \nfriars visited him, played at bowls with him, showed him various \nattentions, talked persuasively with him, gave him money for his \nprison comforts, and induced him to sign, I fear, as many as six \nrecantations.  But when, after all, he was taken out to be burnt, \nhe was nobly true to his better self, and made a glorious end.\n\nAfter prayers and a sermon, Dr. Cole, the preacher of the day (who \nhad been one of the artful priests about Cranmer in prison), \nrequired him to make a public confession of his faith before the \npeople.  This, Cole did, expecting that he would declare himself a \nRoman Catholic.  \'I will make a profession of my faith,\' said \nCranmer, \'and with a good will too.\'\n\nThen, he arose before them all, and took from the sleeve of his \nrobe a written prayer and read it aloud.  That done, he kneeled and \nsaid the Lord\'s Prayer, all the people joining; and then he arose \nagain and told them that he believed in the Bible, and that in what \nhe had lately written, he had written what was not the truth, and \nthat, because his right hand had signed those papers, he would burn \nhis right hand first when he came to the fire.  As for the Pope, he \ndid refuse him and denounce him as the enemy of Heaven.  Hereupon \nthe pious Dr. Cole cried out to the guards to stop that heretic\'s \nmouth and take him away.\n\nSo they took him away, and chained him to the stake, where he \nhastily took off his own clothes to make ready for the flames.  And \nhe stood before the people with a bald head and a white and flowing \nbeard.  He was so firm now when the worst was come, that he again \ndeclared against his recantation, and was so impressive and so \nundismayed, that a certain lord, who was one of the directors of \nthe execution, called out to the men to make haste!  When the fire \nwas lighted, Cranmer, true to his latest word, stretched out his \nright hand, and crying out, \'This hand hath offended!\' held it \namong the flames, until it blazed and burned away.  His heart was \nfound entire among his ashes, and he left at last a memorable name \nin English history.  Cardinal Pole celebrated the day by saying his \nfirst mass, and next day he was made Archbishop of Canterbury in \nCranmer\'s place.\n\nThe Queen\'s husband, who was now mostly abroad in his own \ndominions, and generally made a coarse jest of her to his more \nfamiliar courtiers, was at war with France, and came over to seek \nthe assistance of England.  England was very unwilling to engage in \na French war for his sake; but it happened that the King of France, \nat this very time, aided a descent upon the English coast.  Hence, \nwar was declared, greatly to Philip\'s satisfaction; and the Queen \nraised a sum of money with which to carry it on, by every \nunjustifiable means in her power.  It met with no profitable \nreturn, for the French Duke of Guise surprised Calais, and the \nEnglish sustained a complete defeat.  The losses they met with in \nFrance greatly mortified the national pride, and the Queen never \nrecovered the blow.\n\nThere was a bad fever raging in England at this time, and I am glad \nto write that the Queen took it, and the hour of her death came.  \n\'When I am dead and my body is opened,\' she said to those around \nthose around her, \'ye shall find CALAIS written on my heart.\'  I \nshould have thought, if anything were written on it, they would \nhave found the words - JANE GREY, HOOPER, ROGERS, RIDLEY, LATIMER, \nCRANMER, AND THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE BURNT ALIVE WITHIN FOUR YEARS OF \nMY WICKED REIGN, INCLUDING SIXTY WOMEN AND FORTY LITTLE CHILDREN.  \nBut it is enough that their deaths were written in Heaven.\n\nThe Queen died on the seventeenth of November, fifteen hundred and \nfifty-eight, after reigning not quite five years and a half, and in \nthe forty-fourth year of her age.  Cardinal Pole died of the same \nfever next day.\n\nAs BLOODY QUEEN MARY, this woman has become famous, and as BLOODY \nQUEEN MARY, she will ever be justly remembered with horror and \ndetestation in Great Britain.  Her memory has been held in such \nabhorrence that some writers have arisen in later years to take her \npart, and to show that she was, upon the whole, quite an amiable \nand cheerful sovereign!  \'By their fruits ye shall know them,\' said \nOUR SAVIOUR.  The stake and the fire were the fruits of this reign, \nand you will judge this Queen by nothing else.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI - ENGLAND UNDER ELIZABETH\n\n\n\nTHERE was great rejoicing all over the land when the Lords of the \nCouncil went down to Hatfield, to hail the Princess Elizabeth as \nthe new Queen of England.  Weary of the barbarities of Mary\'s \nreign, the people looked with hope and gladness to the new \nSovereign.  The nation seemed to wake from a horrible dream; and \nHeaven, so long hidden by the smoke of the fires that roasted men \nand women to death, appeared to brighten once more.\n\nQueen Elizabeth was five-and-twenty years of age when she rode \nthrough the streets of London, from the Tower to Westminster Abbey, \nto be crowned.  Her countenance was strongly marked, but on the \nwhole, commanding and dignified; her hair was red, and her nose \nsomething too long and sharp for a woman\'s.  She was not the \nbeautiful creature her courtiers made out; but she was well enough, \nand no doubt looked all the better for coming after the dark and \ngloomy Mary.  She was well educated, but a roundabout writer, and \nrather a hard swearer and coarse talker.  She was clever, but \ncunning and deceitful, and inherited much of her father\'s violent \ntemper.  I mention this now, because she has been so over-praised \nby one party, and so over-abused by another, that it is hardly \npossible to understand the greater part of her reign without first \nunderstanding what kind of woman she really was.\n\nShe began her reign with the great advantage of having a very wise \nand careful Minister, SIR WILLIAM CECIL, whom she afterwards made \nLORD BURLEIGH.  Altogether, the people had greater reason for \nrejoicing than they usually had, when there were processions in the \nstreets; and they were happy with some reason.  All kinds of shows \nand images were set up; GOG and MAGOG were hoisted to the top of \nTemple Bar, and (which was more to the purpose) the Corporation \ndutifully presented the young Queen with the sum of a thousand \nmarks in gold - so heavy a present, that she was obliged to take it \ninto her carriage with both hands.  The coronation was a great \nsuccess; and, on the next day, one of the courtiers presented a \npetition to the new Queen, praying that as it was the custom to \nrelease some prisoners on such occasions, she would have the \ngoodness to release the four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and \nJohn, and also the Apostle Saint Paul, who had been for some time \nshut up in a strange language so that the people could not get at \nthem.\n\nTo this, the Queen replied that it would be better first to inquire \nof themselves whether they desired to be released or not; and, as a \nmeans of finding out, a great public discussion - a sort of \nreligious tournament - was appointed to take place between certain \nchampions of the two religions, in Westminster Abbey.  You may \nsuppose that it was soon made pretty clear to common sense, that \nfor people to benefit by what they repeat or read, it is rather \nnecessary they should understand something about it.  Accordingly, \na Church Service in plain English was settled, and other laws and \nregulations were made, completely establishing the great work of \nthe Reformation.  The Romish bishops and champions were not harshly \ndealt with, all things considered; and the Queen\'s Ministers were \nboth prudent and merciful.\n\nThe one great trouble of this reign, and the unfortunate cause of \nthe greater part of such turmoil and bloodshed as occurred in it, \nwas MARY STUART, QUEEN OF SCOTS.  We will try to understand, in as \nfew words as possible, who Mary was, what she was, and how she came \nto be a thorn in the royal pillow of Elizabeth.\n\nShe was the daughter of the Queen Regent of Scotland, MARY OF \nGUISE.  She had been married, when a mere child, to the Dauphin, \nthe son and heir of the King of France.  The Pope, who pretended \nthat no one could rightfully wear the crown of England without his \ngracious permission, was strongly opposed to Elizabeth, who had not \nasked for the said gracious permission.  And as Mary Queen of Scots \nwould have inherited the English crown in right of her birth, \nsupposing the English Parliament not to have altered the \nsuccession, the Pope himself, and most of the discontented who were \nfollowers of his, maintained that Mary was the rightful Queen of \nEngland, and Elizabeth the wrongful Queen.  Mary being so closely \nconnected with France, and France being jealous of England, there \nwas far greater danger in this than there would have been if she \nhad had no alliance with that great power.  And when her young \nhusband, on the death of his father, became FRANCIS THE SECOND, \nKing of France, the matter grew very serious.  For, the young \ncouple styled themselves King and Queen of England, and the Pope \nwas disposed to help them by doing all the mischief he could.\n\nNow, the reformed religion, under the guidance of a stern and \npowerful preacher, named JOHN KNOX, and other such men, had been \nmaking fierce progress in Scotland.  It was still a half savage \ncountry, where there was a great deal of murdering and rioting \ncontinually going on; and the Reformers, instead of reforming those \nevils as they should have done, went to work in the ferocious old \nScottish spirit, laying churches and chapels waste, pulling down \npictures and altars, and knocking about the Grey Friars, and the \nBlack Friars, and the White Friars, and the friars of all sorts of \ncolours, in all directions.  This obdurate and harsh spirit of the \nScottish Reformers (the Scotch have always been rather a sullen and \nfrowning people in religious matters) put up the blood of the \nRomish French court, and caused France to send troops over to \nScotland, with the hope of setting the friars of all sorts of \ncolours on their legs again; of conquering that country first, and \nEngland afterwards; and so crushing the Reformation all to pieces.  \nThe Scottish Reformers, who had formed a great league which they \ncalled The Congregation of the Lord, secretly represented to \nElizabeth that, if the reformed religion got the worst of it with \nthem, it would be likely to get the worst of it in England too; and \nthus, Elizabeth, though she had a high notion of the rights of \nKings and Queens to do anything they liked, sent an army to \nScotland to support the Reformers, who were in arms against their \nsovereign.  All these proceedings led to a treaty of peace at \nEdinburgh, under which the French consented to depart from the \nkingdom.  By a separate treaty, Mary and her young husband engaged \nto renounce their assumed title of King and Queen of England.  But \nthis treaty they never fulfilled.\n\nIt happened, soon after matters had got to this state, that the \nyoung French King died, leaving Mary a young widow.  She was then \ninvited by her Scottish subjects to return home and reign over \nthem; and as she was not now happy where she was, she, after a \nlittle time, complied.\n\nElizabeth had been Queen three years, when Mary Queen of Scots \nembarked at Calais for her own rough, quarrelling country.  As she \ncame out of the harbour, a vessel was lost before her eyes, and she \nsaid, \'O! good God! what an omen this is for such a voyage!\'  She \nwas very fond of France, and sat on the deck, looking back at it \nand weeping, until it was quite dark.  When she went to bed, she \ndirected to be called at daybreak, if the French coast were still \nvisible, that she might behold it for the last time.  As it proved \nto be a clear morning, this was done, and she again wept for the \ncountry she was leaving, and said many times, \' Farewell, France!  \nFarewell, France!  I shall never see thee again!\'  All this was \nlong remembered afterwards, as sorrowful and interesting in a fair \nyoung princess of nineteen.  Indeed, I am afraid it gradually came, \ntogether with her other distresses, to surround her with greater \nsympathy than she deserved.\n\nWhen she came to Scotland, and took up her abode at the palace of \nHolyrood in Edinburgh, she found herself among uncouth strangers \nand wild uncomfortable customs very different from her experiences \nin the court of France.  The very people who were disposed to love \nher, made her head ache when she was tired out by her voyage, with \na serenade of discordant music - a fearful concert of bagpipes, I \nsuppose - and brought her and her train home to her palace on \nmiserable little Scotch horses that appeared to be half starved.  \nAmong the people who were not disposed to love her, she found the \npowerful leaders of the Reformed Church, who were bitter upon her \namusements, however innocent, and denounced music and dancing as \nworks of the devil.  John Knox himself often lectured her, \nviolently and angrily, and did much to make her life unhappy.  All \nthese reasons confirmed her old attachment to the Romish religion, \nand caused her, there is no doubt, most imprudently and dangerously \nboth for herself and for England too, to give a solemn pledge to \nthe heads of the Romish Church that if she ever succeeded to the \nEnglish crown, she would set up that religion again.  In reading \nher unhappy history, you must always remember this; and also that \nduring her whole life she was constantly put forward against the \nQueen, in some form or other, by the Romish party.\n\nThat Elizabeth, on the other hand, was not inclined to like her, is \npretty certain.  Elizabeth was very vain and jealous, and had an \nextraordinary dislike to people being married.  She treated Lady \nCatherine Grey, sister of the beheaded Lady Jane, with such \nshameful severity, for no other reason than her being secretly \nmarried, that she died and her husband was ruined; so, when a \nsecond marriage for Mary began to be talked about, probably \nElizabeth disliked her more.  Not that Elizabeth wanted suitors of \nher own, for they started up from Spain, Austria, Sweden, and \nEngland.  Her English lover at this time, and one whom she much \nfavoured too, was LORD ROBERT DUDLEY, Earl of Leicester - himself \nsecretly married to AMY ROBSART, the daughter of an English \ngentleman, whom he was strongly suspected of causing to be \nmurdered, down at his country seat, Cumnor Hall in Berkshire, that \nhe might be free to marry the Queen.  Upon this story, the great \nwriter, SIR WALTER SCOTT, has founded one of his best romances.  \nBut if Elizabeth knew how to lead her handsome favourite on, for \nher own vanity and pleasure, she knew how to stop him for her own \npride; and his love, and all the other proposals, came to nothing.  \nThe Queen always declared in good set speeches, that she would \nnever be married at all, but would live and die a Maiden Queen.  It \nwas a very pleasant and meritorious declaration, I suppose; but it \nhas been puffed and trumpeted so much, that I am rather tired of it \nmyself.\n\nDivers princes proposed to marry Mary, but the English court had \nreasons for being jealous of them all, and even proposed as a \nmatter of policy that she should marry that very Earl of Leicester \nwho had aspired to be the husband of Elizabeth.  At last, LORD \nDARNLEY, son of the Earl of Lennox, and himself descended from the \nRoyal Family of Scotland, went over with Elizabeth\'s consent to try \nhis fortune at Holyrood.  He was a tall simpleton; and could dance \nand play the guitar; but I know of nothing else he could do, unless \nit were to get very drunk, and eat gluttonously, and make a \ncontemptible spectacle of himself in many mean and vain ways.  \nHowever, he gained Mary\'s heart, not disdaining in the pursuit of \nhis object to ally himself with one of her secretaries, DAVID \nRIZZIO, who had great influence with her.  He soon married the \nQueen.  This marriage does not say much for her, but what followed \nwill presently say less.\n\nMary\'s brother, the EARL OF MURRAY, and head of the Protestant \nparty in Scotland, had opposed this marriage, partly on religious \ngrounds, and partly perhaps from personal dislike of the very \ncontemptible bridegroom.  When it had taken place, through Mary\'s \ngaining over to it the more powerful of the lords about her, she \nbanished Murray for his pains; and, when he and some other nobles \nrose in arms to support the reformed religion, she herself, within \na month of her wedding day, rode against them in armour with loaded \npistols in her saddle.  Driven out of Scotland, they presented \nthemselves before Elizabeth - who called them traitors in public, \nand assisted them in private, according to her crafty nature.\n\nMary had been married but a little while, when she began to hate \nher husband, who, in his turn, began to hate that David Rizzio, \nwith whom he had leagued to gain her favour, and whom he now \nbelieved to be her lover.  He hated Rizzio to that extent, that he \nmade a compact with LORD RUTHVEN and three other lords to get rid \nof him by murder.  This wicked agreement they made in solemn \nsecrecy upon the first of March, fifteen hundred and sixty-six, and \non the night of Saturday the ninth, the conspirators were brought \nby Darnley up a private staircase, dark and steep, into a range of \nrooms where they knew that Mary was sitting at supper with her \nsister, Lady Argyle, and this doomed man.  When they went into the \nroom, Darnley took the Queen round the waist, and Lord Ruthven, who \nhad risen from a bed of sickness to do this murder, came in, gaunt \nand ghastly, leaning on two men.  Rizzio ran behind the Queen for \nshelter and protection.  \'Let him come out of the room,\' said \nRuthven.  \'He shall not leave the room,\' replied the Queen; \'I read \nhis danger in your face, and it is my will that he remain here.\'  \nThey then set upon him, struggled with him, overturned the table, \ndragged him out, and killed him with fifty-six stabs.  When the \nQueen heard that he was dead, she said, \'No more tears.  I will \nthink now of revenge!\'\n\nWithin a day or two, she gained her husband over, and prevailed on \nthe tall idiot to abandon the conspirators and fly with her to \nDunbar.  There, he issued a proclamation, audaciously and falsely \ndenying that he had any knowledge of the late bloody business; and \nthere they were joined by the EARL BOTHWELL and some other nobles.  \nWith their help, they raised eight thousand men; returned to \nEdinburgh, and drove the assassins into England.  Mary soon \nafterwards gave birth to a son - still thinking of revenge.\n\nThat she should have had a greater scorn for her husband after his \nlate cowardice and treachery than she had had before, was natural \nenough.  There is little doubt that she now began to love Bothwell \ninstead, and to plan with him means of getting rid of Darnley.  \nBothwell had such power over her that he induced her even to pardon \nthe assassins of Rizzio.  The arrangements for the Christening of \nthe young Prince were entrusted to him, and he was one of the most \nimportant people at the ceremony, where the child was named JAMES:  \nElizabeth being his godmother, though not present on the occasion.  \nA week afterwards, Darnley, who had left Mary and gone to his \nfather\'s house at Glasgow, being taken ill with the small-pox, she \nsent her own physician to attend him.  But there is reason to \napprehend that this was merely a show and a pretence, and that she \nknew what was doing, when Bothwell within another month proposed to \none of the late conspirators against Rizzio, to murder Darnley, \n\'for that it was the Queen\'s mind that he should be taken away.\'  \nIt is certain that on that very day she wrote to her ambassador in \nFrance, complaining of him, and yet went immediately to Glasgow, \nfeigning to be very anxious about him, and to love him very much.  \nIf she wanted to get him in her power, she succeeded to her heart\'s \ncontent; for she induced him to go back with her to Edinburgh, and \nto occupy, instead of the palace, a lone house outside the city \ncalled the Kirk of Field.  Here, he lived for about a week.  One \nSunday night, she remained with him until ten o\'clock, and then \nleft him, to go to Holyrood to be present at an entertainment given \nin celebration of the marriage of one of her favourite servants.  \nAt two o\'clock in the morning the city was shaken by a great \nexplosion, and the Kirk of Field was blown to atoms.\n\nDarnley\'s body was found next day lying under a tree at some \ndistance.  How it came there, undisfigured and unscorched by \ngunpowder, and how this crime came to be so clumsily and strangely \ncommitted, it is impossible to discover.  The deceitful character \nof Mary, and the deceitful character of Elizabeth, have rendered \nalmost every part of their joint history uncertain and obscure.  \nBut, I fear that Mary was unquestionably a party to her husband\'s \nmurder, and that this was the revenge she had threatened.  The \nScotch people universally believed it.  Voices cried out in the \nstreets of Edinburgh in the dead of the night, for justice on the \nmurderess.  Placards were posted by unknown hands in the public \nplaces denouncing Bothwell as the murderer, and the Queen as his \naccomplice; and, when he afterwards married her (though himself \nalready married), previously making a show of taking her prisoner \nby force, the indignation of the people knew no bounds.  The women \nparticularly are described as having been quite frantic against the \nQueen, and to have hooted and cried after her in the streets with \nterrific vehemence.\n\nSuch guilty unions seldom prosper.  This husband and wife had lived \ntogether but a month, when they were separated for ever by the \nsuccesses of a band of Scotch nobles who associated against them \nfor the protection of the young Prince:  whom Bothwell had vainly \nendeavoured to lay hold of, and whom he would certainly have \nmurdered, if the EARL OF MAR, in whose hands the boy was, had not \nbeen firmly and honourably faithful to his trust.  Before this \nangry power, Bothwell fled abroad, where he died, a prisoner and \nmad, nine miserable years afterwards.  Mary being found by the \nassociated lords to deceive them at every turn, was sent a prisoner \nto Lochleven Castle; which, as it stood in the midst of a lake, \ncould only be approached by boat.  Here, one LORD LINDSAY, who was \nso much of a brute that the nobles would have done better if they \nhad chosen a mere gentleman for their messenger, made her sign her \nabdication, and appoint Murray, Regent of Scotland.  Here, too, \nMurray saw her in a sorrowing and humbled state.\n\nShe had better have remained in the castle of Lochleven, dull \nprison as it was, with the rippling of the lake against it, and the \nmoving shadows of the water on the room walls; but she could not \nrest there, and more than once tried to escape.  The first time she \nhad nearly succeeded, dressed in the clothes of her own washer-\nwoman, but, putting up her hand to prevent one of the boatmen from \nlifting her veil, the men suspected her, seeing how white it was, \nand rowed her back again.  A short time afterwards, her fascinating \nmanners enlisted in her cause a boy in the Castle, called the \nlittle DOUGLAS, who, while the family were at supper, stole the \nkeys of the great gate, went softly out with the Queen, locked the \ngate on the outside, and rowed her away across the lake, sinking \nthe keys as they went along.  On the opposite shore she was met by \nanother Douglas, and some few lords; and, so accompanied, rode away \non horseback to Hamilton, where they raised three thousand men.  \nHere, she issued a proclamation declaring that the abdication she \nhad signed in her prison was illegal, and requiring the Regent to \nyield to his lawful Queen.  Being a steady soldier, and in no way \ndiscomposed although he was without an army, Murray pretended to \ntreat with her, until he had collected a force about half equal to \nher own, and then he gave her battle.  In one quarter of an hour he \ncut down all her hopes.  She had another weary ride on horse-back \nof sixty long Scotch miles, and took shelter at Dundrennan Abbey, \nwhence she fled for safety to Elizabeth\'s dominions.\n\nMary Queen of Scots came to England - to her own ruin, the trouble \nof the kingdom, and the misery and death of many - in the year one \nthousand five hundred and sixty-eight.  How she left it and the \nworld, nineteen years afterwards, we have now to see.\n\n\nSECOND PART\n\n\nWHEN Mary Queen of Scots arrived in England, without money and even \nwithout any other clothes than those she wore, she wrote to \nElizabeth, representing herself as an innocent and injured piece of \nRoyalty, and entreating her assistance to oblige her Scottish \nsubjects to take her back again and obey her.  But, as her \ncharacter was already known in England to be a very different one \nfrom what she made it out to be, she was told in answer that she \nmust first clear herself.  Made uneasy by this condition, Mary, \nrather than stay in England, would have gone to Spain, or to \nFrance, or would even have gone back to Scotland.  But, as her \ndoing either would have been likely to trouble England afresh, it \nwas decided that she should be detained here.  She first came to \nCarlisle, and, after that, was moved about from castle to castle, \nas was considered necessary; but England she never left again.\n\nAfter trying very hard to get rid of the necessity of clearing \nherself, Mary, advised by LORD HERRIES, her best friend in England, \nagreed to answer the charges against her, if the Scottish noblemen \nwho made them would attend to maintain them before such English \nnoblemen as Elizabeth might appoint for that purpose.  Accordingly, \nsuch an assembly, under the name of a conference, met, first at \nYork, and afterwards at Hampton Court.  In its presence Lord \nLennox, Darnley\'s father, openly charged Mary with the murder of \nhis son; and whatever Mary\'s friends may now say or write in her \nbehalf, there is no doubt that, when her brother Murray produced \nagainst her a casket containing certain guilty letters and verses \nwhich he stated to have passed between her and Bothwell, she \nwithdrew from the inquiry.  Consequently, it is to be supposed that \nshe was then considered guilty by those who had the best \nopportunities of judging of the truth, and that the feeling which \nafterwards arose in her behalf was a very generous but not a very \nreasonable one.\n\nHowever, the DUKE OF NORFOLK, an honourable but rather weak \nnobleman, partly because Mary was captivating, partly because he \nwas ambitious, partly because he was over-persuaded by artful \nplotters against Elizabeth, conceived a strong idea that he would \nlike to marry the Queen of Scots - though he was a little \nfrightened, too, by the letters in the casket.  This idea being \nsecretly encouraged by some of the noblemen of Elizabeth\'s court, \nand even by the favourite Earl of Leicester (because it was \nobjected to by other favourites who were his rivals), Mary \nexpressed her approval of it, and the King of France and the King \nof Spain are supposed to have done the same.  It was not so quietly \nplanned, though, but that it came to Elizabeth\'s ears, who warned \nthe Duke \'to be careful what sort of pillow he was going to lay his \nhead upon.\'  He made a humble reply at the time; but turned sulky \nsoon afterwards, and, being considered dangerous, was sent to the \nTower.\n\nThus, from the moment of Mary\'s coming to England she began to be \nthe centre of plots and miseries.\n\nA rise of the Catholics in the north was the next of these, and it \nwas only checked by many executions and much bloodshed.  It was \nfollowed by a great conspiracy of the Pope and some of the Catholic \nsovereigns of Europe to depose Elizabeth, place Mary on the throne, \nand restore the unreformed religion.  It is almost impossible to \ndoubt that Mary knew and approved of this; and the Pope himself was \nso hot in the matter that he issued a bull, in which he openly \ncalled Elizabeth the \'pretended Queen\' of England, excommunicated \nher, and excommunicated all her subjects who should continue to \nobey her.  A copy of this miserable paper got into London, and was \nfound one morning publicly posted on the Bishop of London\'s gate.  \nA great hue and cry being raised, another copy was found in the \nchamber of a student of Lincoln\'s Inn, who confessed, being put \nupon the rack, that he had received it from one JOHN FELTON, a rich \ngentleman who lived across the Thames, near Southwark.  This John \nFelton, being put upon the rack too, confessed that he had posted \nthe placard on the Bishop\'s gate.  For this offence he was, within \nfour days, taken to St. Paul\'s Churchyard, and there hanged and \nquartered.  As to the Pope\'s bull, the people by the reformation \nhaving thrown off the Pope, did not care much, you may suppose, for \nthe Pope\'s throwing off them.  It was a mere dirty piece of paper, \nand not half so powerful as a street ballad.\n\nOn the very day when Felton was brought to his trial, the poor Duke \nof Norfolk was released.  It would have been well for him if he had \nkept away from the Tower evermore, and from the snares that had \ntaken him there.  But, even while he was in that dismal place he \ncorresponded with Mary, and as soon as he was out of it, he began \nto plot again.  Being discovered in correspondence with the Pope, \nwith a view to a rising in England which should force Elizabeth to \nconsent to his marriage with Mary and to repeal the laws against \nthe Catholics, he was re-committed to the Tower and brought to \ntrial.  He was found guilty by the unanimous verdict of the Lords \nwho tried him, and was sentenced to the block.\n\nIt is very difficult to make out, at this distance of time, and \nbetween opposite accounts, whether Elizabeth really was a humane \nwoman, or desired to appear so, or was fearful of shedding the \nblood of people of great name who were popular in the country.  \nTwice she commanded and countermanded the execution of this Duke, \nand it did not take place until five months after his trial.  The \nscaffold was erected on Tower Hill, and there he died like a brave \nman.  He refused to have his eyes bandaged, saying that he was not \nat all afraid of death; and he admitted the justice of his \nsentence, and was much regretted by the people.\n\nAlthough Mary had shrunk at the most important time from disproving \nher guilt, she was very careful never to do anything that would \nadmit it.  All such proposals as were made to her by Elizabeth for \nher release, required that admission in some form or other, and \ntherefore came to nothing.  Moreover, both women being artful and \ntreacherous, and neither ever trusting the other, it was not likely \nthat they could ever make an agreement.  So, the Parliament, \naggravated by what the Pope had done, made new and strong laws \nagainst the spreading of the Catholic religion in England, and \ndeclared it treason in any one to say that the Queen and her \nsuccessors were not the lawful sovereigns of England.  It would \nhave done more than this, but for Elizabeth\'s moderation.\n\nSince the Reformation, there had come to be three great sects of \nreligious people - or people who called themselves so - in England; \nthat is to say, those who belonged to the Reformed Church, those \nwho belonged to the Unreformed Church, and those who were called \nthe Puritans, because they said that they wanted to have everything \nvery pure and plain in all the Church service.  These last were for \nthe most part an uncomfortable people, who thought it highly \nmeritorious to dress in a hideous manner, talk through their noses, \nand oppose all harmless enjoyments.  But they were powerful too, \nand very much in earnest, and they were one and all the determined \nenemies of the Queen of Scots.  The Protestant feeling in England \nwas further strengthened by the tremendous cruelties to which \nProtestants were exposed in France and in the Netherlands.  Scores \nof thousands of them were put to death in those countries with \nevery cruelty that can be imagined, and at last, in the autumn of \nthe year one thousand five hundred and seventy-two, one of the \ngreatest barbarities ever committed in the world took place at \nParis.\n\nIt is called in history, THE MASSACRE OF SAINT BARTHOLOMEW, because \nit took place on Saint Bartholomew\'s Eve.  The day fell on Saturday \nthe twenty-third of August.  On that day all the great leaders of \nthe Protestants (who were there called HUGUENOTS) were assembled \ntogether, for the purpose, as was represented to them, of doing \nhonour to the marriage of their chief, the young King of Navarre, \nwith the sister of CHARLES THE NINTH:  a miserable young King who \nthen occupied the French throne.  This dull creature was made to \nbelieve by his mother and other fierce Catholics about him that the \nHuguenots meant to take his life; and he was persuaded to give \nsecret orders that, on the tolling of a great bell, they should be \nfallen upon by an overpowering force of armed men, and slaughtered \nwherever they could be found.  When the appointed hour was close at \nhand, the stupid wretch, trembling from head to foot, was taken \ninto a balcony by his mother to see the atrocious work begun.  The \nmoment the bell tolled, the murderers broke forth.  During all that \nnight and the two next days, they broke into the houses, fired the \nhouses, shot and stabbed the Protestants, men, women, and children, \nand flung their bodies into the streets.  They were shot at in the \nstreets as they passed along, and their blood ran down the gutters.  \nUpwards of ten thousand Protestants were killed in Paris alone; in \nall France four or five times that number.  To return thanks to \nHeaven for these diabolical murders, the Pope and his train \nactually went in public procession at Rome, and as if this were not \nshame enough for them, they had a medal struck to commemorate the \nevent.  But, however comfortable the wholesale murders were to \nthese high authorities, they had not that soothing effect upon the \ndoll-King.  I am happy to state that he never knew a moment\'s peace \nafterwards; that he was continually crying out that he saw the \nHuguenots covered with blood and wounds falling dead before him; \nand that he died within a year, shrieking and yelling and raving to \nthat degree, that if all the Popes who had ever lived had been \nrolled into one, they would not have afforded His guilty Majesty \nthe slightest consolation.\n\nWhen the terrible news of the massacre arrived in England, it made \na powerful impression indeed upon the people.  If they began to run \na little wild against the Catholics at about this time, this \nfearful reason for it, coming so soon after the days of bloody \nQueen Mary, must be remembered in their excuse.  The Court was not \nquite so honest as the people - but perhaps it sometimes is not.  \nIt received the French ambassador, with all the lords and ladies \ndressed in deep mourning, and keeping a profound silence.  \nNevertheless, a proposal of marriage which he had made to Elizabeth \nonly two days before the eve of Saint Bartholomew, on behalf of the \nDuke of Alenáon, the French King\'s brother, a boy of seventeen, \nstill went on; while on the other hand, in her usual crafty way, \nthe Queen secretly supplied the Huguenots with money and weapons.\n\nI must say that for a Queen who made all those fine speeches, of \nwhich I have confessed myself to be rather tired, about living and \ndying a Maiden Queen, Elizabeth was \'going\' to be married pretty \noften.  Besides always having some English favourite or other whom \nshe by turns encouraged and swore at and knocked about - for the \nmaiden Queen was very free with her fists - she held this French \nDuke off and on through several years.  When he at last came over \nto England, the marriage articles were actually drawn up, and it \nwas settled that the wedding should take place in six weeks.  The \nQueen was then so bent upon it, that she prosecuted a poor Puritan \nnamed STUBBS, and a poor bookseller named PAGE, for writing and \npublishing a pamphlet against it.  Their right hands were chopped \noff for this crime; and poor Stubbs - more loyal than I should have \nbeen myself under the circumstances - immediately pulled off his \nhat with his left hand, and cried, \'God save the Queen!\'  Stubbs \nwas cruelly treated; for the marriage never took place after all, \nthough the Queen pledged herself to the Duke with a ring from her \nown finger.  He went away, no better than he came, when the \ncourtship had lasted some ten years altogether; and he died a \ncouple of years afterwards, mourned by Elizabeth, who appears to \nhave been really fond of him.  It is not much to her credit, for he \nwas a bad enough member of a bad family.\n\nTo return to the Catholics.  There arose two orders of priests, who \nwere very busy in England, and who were much dreaded.  These were \nthe JESUITS (who were everywhere in all sorts of disguises), and \nthe SEMINARY PRIESTS.  The people had a great horror of the first, \nbecause they were known to have taught that murder was lawful if it \nwere done with an object of which they approved; and they had a \ngreat horror of the second, because they came to teach the old \nreligion, and to be the successors of \'Queen Mary\'s priests,\' as \nthose yet lingering in England were called, when they should die \nout.  The severest laws were made against them, and were most \nunmercifully executed.  Those who sheltered them in their houses \noften suffered heavily for what was an act of humanity; and the \nrack, that cruel torture which tore men\'s limbs asunder, was \nconstantly kept going.  What these unhappy men confessed, or what \nwas ever confessed by any one under that agony, must always be \nreceived with great doubt, as it is certain that people have \nfrequently owned to the most absurd and impossible crimes to escape \nsuch dreadful suffering.  But I cannot doubt it to have been proved \nby papers, that there were many plots, both among the Jesuits, and \nwith France, and with Scotland, and with Spain, for the destruction \nof Queen Elizabeth, for the placing of Mary on the throne, and for \nthe revival of the old religion.\n\nIf the English people were too ready to believe in plots, there \nwere, as I have said, good reasons for it.  When the massacre of \nSaint Bartholomew was yet fresh in their recollection, a great \nProtestant Dutch hero, the PRINCE OF ORANGE, was shot by an \nassassin, who confessed that he had been kept and trained for the \npurpose in a college of Jesuits.  The Dutch, in this surprise and \ndistress, offered to make Elizabeth their sovereign, but she \ndeclined the honour, and sent them a small army instead, under the \ncommand of the Earl of Leicester, who, although a capital Court \nfavourite, was not much of a general.  He did so little in Holland, \nthat his campaign there would probably have been forgotten, but for \nits occasioning the death of one of the best writers, the best \nknights, and the best gentlemen, of that or any age.  This was SIR \nPHILIP SIDNEY, who was wounded by a musket ball in the thigh as he \nmounted a fresh horse, after having had his own killed under him.  \nHe had to ride back wounded, a long distance, and was very faint \nwith fatigue and loss of blood, when some water, for which he had \neagerly asked, was handed to him.  But he was so good and gentle \neven then, that seeing a poor badly wounded common soldier lying on \nthe ground, looking at the water with longing eyes, he said, \'Thy \nnecessity is greater than mine,\' and gave it up to him.  This \ntouching action of a noble heart is perhaps as well known as any \nincident in history - is as famous far and wide as the blood-\nstained Tower of London, with its axe, and block, and murders out \nof number.  So delightful is an act of true humanity, and so glad \nare mankind to remember it.\n\nAt home, intelligence of plots began to thicken every day.  I \nsuppose the people never did live under such continual terrors as \nthose by which they were possessed now, of Catholic risings, and \nburnings, and poisonings, and I don\'t know what.  Still, we must \nalways remember that they lived near and close to awful realities \nof that kind, and that with their experience it was not difficult \nto believe in any enormity.  The government had the same fear, and \ndid not take the best means of discovering the truth - for, besides \ntorturing the suspected, it employed paid spies, who will always \nlie for their own profit.  It even made some of the conspiracies it \nbrought to light, by sending false letters to disaffected people, \ninviting them to join in pretended plots, which they too readily \ndid.\n\nBut, one great real plot was at length discovered, and it ended the \ncareer of Mary, Queen of Scots.  A seminary priest named BALLARD, \nand a Spanish soldier named SAVAGE, set on and encouraged by \ncertain French priests, imparted a design to one ANTONY BABINGTON - \na gentleman of fortune in Derbyshire, who had been for some time a \nsecret agent of Mary\'s - for murdering the Queen.  Babington then \nconfided the scheme to some other Catholic gentlemen who were his \nfriends, and they joined in it heartily.  They were vain, weak-\nheaded young men, ridiculously confident, and preposterously proud \nof their plan; for they got a gimcrack painting made, of the six \nchoice spirits who were to murder Elizabeth, with Babington in an \nattitude for the centre figure.  Two of their number, however, one \nof whom was a priest, kept Elizabeth\'s wisest minister, SIR FRANCIS \nWALSINGHAM, acquainted with the whole project from the first.  The \nconspirators were completely deceived to the final point, when \nBabington gave Savage, because he was shabby, a ring from his \nfinger, and some money from his purse, wherewith to buy himself new \nclothes in which to kill the Queen.  Walsingham, having then full \nevidence against the whole band, and two letters of Mary\'s besides, \nresolved to seize them.  Suspecting something wrong, they stole out \nof the city, one by one, and hid themselves in St. John\'s Wood, and \nother places which really were hiding places then; but they were \nall taken, and all executed.  When they were seized, a gentleman \nwas sent from Court to inform Mary of the fact, and of her being \ninvolved in the discovery.  Her friends have complained that she \nwas kept in very hard and severe custody.  It does not appear very \nlikely, for she was going out a hunting that very morning.\n\nQueen Elizabeth had been warned long ago, by one in France who had \ngood information of what was secretly doing, that in holding Mary \nalive, she held \'the wolf who would devour her.\'  The Bishop of \nLondon had, more lately, given the Queen\'s favourite minister the \nadvice in writing, \'forthwith to cut off the Scottish Queen\'s \nhead.\'  The question now was, what to do with her?  The Earl of \nLeicester wrote a little note home from Holland, recommending that \nshe should be quietly poisoned; that noble favourite having \naccustomed his mind, it is possible, to remedies of that nature.  \nHis black advice, however, was disregarded, and she was brought to \ntrial at Fotheringay Castle in Northamptonshire, before a tribunal \nof forty, composed of both religions.  There, and in the Star \nChamber at Westminster, the trial lasted a fortnight.  She defended \nherself with great ability, but could only deny the confessions \nthat had been made by Babington and others; could only call her own \nletters, produced against her by her own secretaries, forgeries; \nand, in short, could only deny everything.  She was found guilty, \nand declared to have incurred the penalty of death.  The Parliament \nmet, approved the sentence, and prayed the Queen to have it \nexecuted.  The Queen replied that she requested them to consider \nwhether no means could be found of saving Mary\'s life without \nendangering her own.  The Parliament rejoined, No; and the citizens \nilluminated their houses and lighted bonfires, in token of their \njoy that all these plots and troubles were to be ended by the death \nof the Queen of Scots.\n\nShe, feeling sure that her time was now come, wrote a letter to the \nQueen of England, making three entreaties; first, that she might be \nburied in France; secondly, that she might not be executed in \nsecret, but before her servants and some others; thirdly, that \nafter her death, her servants should not be molested, but should be \nsuffered to go home with the legacies she left them.  It was an \naffecting letter, and Elizabeth shed tears over it, but sent no \nanswer.  Then came a special ambassador from France, and another \nfrom Scotland, to intercede for Mary\'s life; and then the nation \nbegan to clamour, more and more, for her death.\n\nWhat the real feelings or intentions of Elizabeth were, can never \nbe known now; but I strongly suspect her of only wishing one thing \nmore than Mary\'s death, and that was to keep free of the blame of \nit.  On the first of February, one thousand five hundred and \neighty-seven, Lord Burleigh having drawn out the warrant for the \nexecution, the Queen sent to the secretary DAVISON to bring it to \nher, that she might sign it:  which she did.  Next day, when \nDavison told her it was sealed, she angrily asked him why such \nhaste was necessary?  Next day but one, she joked about it, and \nswore a little.  Again, next day but one, she seemed to complain \nthat it was not yet done, but still she would not be plain with \nthose about her.  So, on the seventh, the Earls of Kent and \nShrewsbury, with the Sheriff of Northamptonshire, came with the \nwarrant to Fotheringay, to tell the Queen of Scots to prepare for \ndeath.\n\nWhen those messengers of ill omen were gone, Mary made a frugal \nsupper, drank to her servants, read over her will, went to bed, \nslept for some hours, and then arose and passed the remainder of \nthe night saying prayers.  In the morning she dressed herself in \nher best clothes; and, at eight o\'clock when the sheriff came for \nher to her chapel, took leave of her servants who were there \nassembled praying with her, and went down-stairs, carrying a Bible \nin one hand and a crucifix in the other.  Two of her women and four \nof her men were allowed to be present in the hall; where a low \nscaffold, only two feet from the ground, was erected and covered \nwith black; and where the executioner from the Tower, and his \nassistant, stood, dressed in black velvet.  The hall was full of \npeople.  While the sentence was being read she sat upon a stool; \nand, when it was finished, she again denied her guilt, as she had \ndone before.  The Earl of Kent and the Dean of Peterborough, in \ntheir Protestant zeal, made some very unnecessary speeches to her; \nto which she replied that she died in the Catholic religion, and \nthey need not trouble themselves about that matter.  When her head \nand neck were uncovered by the executioners, she said that she had \nnot been used to be undressed by such hands, or before so much \ncompany.  Finally, one of her women fastened a cloth over her face, \nand she laid her neck upon the block, and repeated more than once \nin Latin, \'Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit!\'  Some say \nher head was struck off in two blows, some say in three.  However \nthat be, when it was held up, streaming with blood, the real hair \nbeneath the false hair she had long worn was seen to be as grey as \nthat of a woman of seventy, though she was at that time only in her \nforty-sixth year.  All her beauty was gone.\n\nBut she was beautiful enough to her little dog, who cowered under \nher dress, frightened, when she went upon the scaffold, and who lay \ndown beside her headless body when all her earthly sorrows were \nover.\n\n\nTHIRD PART\n\n\nON its being formally made known to Elizabeth that the sentence had \nbeen executed on the Queen of Scots, she showed the utmost grief \nand rage, drove her favourites from her with violent indignation, \nand sent Davison to the Tower; from which place he was only \nreleased in the end by paying an immense fine which completely \nruined him.  Elizabeth not only over-acted her part in making these \npretences, but most basely reduced to poverty one of her faithful \nservants for no other fault than obeying her commands.\n\nJames, King of Scotland, Mary\'s son, made a show likewise of being \nvery angry on the occasion; but he was a pensioner of England to \nthe amount of five thousand pounds a year, and he had known very \nlittle of his mother, and he possibly regarded her as the murderer \nof his father, and he soon took it quietly.\n\nPhilip, King of Spain, however, threatened to do greater things \nthan ever had been done yet, to set up the Catholic religion and \npunish Protestant England.  Elizabeth, hearing that he and the \nPrince of Parma were making great preparations for this purpose, in \norder to be beforehand with them sent out ADMIRAL DRAKE (a famous \nnavigator, who had sailed about the world, and had already brought \ngreat plunder from Spain) to the port of Cadiz, where he burnt a \nhundred vessels full of stores.  This great loss obliged the \nSpaniards to put off the invasion for a year; but it was none the \nless formidable for that, amounting to one hundred and thirty \nships, nineteen thousand soldiers, eight thousand sailors, two \nthousand slaves, and between two and three thousand great guns.  \nEngland was not idle in making ready to resist this great force.  \nAll the men between sixteen years old and sixty, were trained and \ndrilled; the national fleet of ships (in number only thirty-four at \nfirst) was enlarged by public contributions and by private ships, \nfitted out by noblemen; the city of London, of its own accord, \nfurnished double the number of ships and men that it was required \nto provide; and, if ever the national spirit was up in England, it \nwas up all through the country to resist the Spaniards.  Some of \nthe Queen\'s advisers were for seizing the principal English \nCatholics, and putting them to death; but the Queen - who, to her \nhonour, used to say, that she would never believe any ill of her \nsubjects, which a parent would not believe of her own children - \nrejected the advice, and only confined a few of those who were the \nmost suspected, in the fens in Lincolnshire.  The great body of \nCatholics deserved this confidence; for they behaved most loyally, \nnobly, and bravely.\n\nSo, with all England firing up like one strong, angry man, and with \nboth sides of the Thames fortified, and with the soldiers under \narms, and with the sailors in their ships, the country waited for \nthe coming of the proud Spanish fleet, which was called THE \nINVINCIBLE ARMADA.  The Queen herself, riding in armour on a white \nhorse, and the Earl of Essex and the Earl of Leicester holding her \nbridal rein, made a brave speech to the troops at Tilbury Fort \nopposite Gravesend, which was received with such enthusiasm as is \nseldom known.  Then came the Spanish Armada into the English \nChannel, sailing along in the form of a half moon, of such great \nsize that it was seven miles broad.  But the English were quickly \nupon it, and woe then to all the Spanish ships that dropped a \nlittle out of the half moon, for the English took them instantly!  \nAnd it soon appeared that the great Armada was anything but \ninvincible, for on a summer night, bold Drake sent eight blazing \nfire-ships right into the midst of it.  In terrible consternation \nthe Spaniards tried to get out to sea, and so became dispersed; the \nEnglish pursued them at a great advantage; a storm came on, and \ndrove the Spaniards among rocks and shoals; and the swift end of \nthe Invincible fleet was, that it lost thirty great ships and ten \nthousand men, and, defeated and disgraced, sailed home again.  \nBeing afraid to go by the English Channel, it sailed all round \nScotland and Ireland; some of the ships getting cast away on the \nlatter coast in bad weather, the Irish, who were a kind of savages, \nplundered those vessels and killed their crews.  So ended this \ngreat attempt to invade and conquer England.  And I think it will \nbe a long time before any other invincible fleet coming to England \nwith the same object, will fare much better than the Spanish \nArmada.\n\nThough the Spanish king had had this bitter taste of English \nbravery, he was so little the wiser for it, as still to entertain \nhis old designs, and even to conceive the absurd idea of placing \nhis daughter on the English throne.  But the Earl of Essex, SIR \nWALTER RALEIGH, SIR THOMAS HOWARD, and some other distinguished \nleaders, put to sea from Plymouth, entered the port of Cadiz once \nmore, obtained a complete victory over the shipping assembled \nthere, and got possession of the town.  In obedience to the Queen\'s \nexpress instructions, they behaved with great humanity; and the \nprincipal loss of the Spaniards was a vast sum of money which they \nhad to pay for ransom.  This was one of many gallant achievements \non the sea, effected in this reign.  Sir Walter Raleigh himself, \nafter marrying a maid of honour and giving offence to the Maiden \nQueen thereby, had already sailed to South America in search of \ngold.\n\nThe Earl of Leicester was now dead, and so was Sir Thomas \nWalsingham, whom Lord Burleigh was soon to follow.  The principal \nfavourite was the EARL OF ESSEX, a spirited and handsome man, a \nfavourite with the people too as well as with the Queen, and \npossessed of many admirable qualities.  It was much debated at \nCourt whether there should be peace with Spain or no, and he was \nvery urgent for war.  He also tried hard to have his own way in the \nappointment of a deputy to govern in Ireland.  One day, while this \nquestion was in dispute, he hastily took offence, and turned his \nback upon the Queen; as a gentle reminder of which impropriety, the \nQueen gave him a tremendous box on the ear, and told him to go to \nthe devil.  He went home instead, and did not reappear at Court for \nhalf a year or so, when he and the Queen were reconciled, though \nnever (as some suppose) thoroughly.\n\nFrom this time the fate of the Earl of Essex and that of the Queen \nseemed to be blended together.  The Irish were still perpetually \nquarrelling and fighting among themselves, and he went over to \nIreland as Lord Lieutenant, to the great joy of his enemies (Sir \nWalter Raleigh among the rest), who were glad to have so dangerous \na rival far off.  Not being by any means successful there, and \nknowing that his enemies would take advantage of that circumstance \nto injure him with the Queen, he came home again, though against \nher orders.  The Queen being taken by surprise when he appeared \nbefore her, gave him her hand to kiss, and he was overjoyed - \nthough it was not a very lovely hand by this time - but in the \ncourse of the same day she ordered him to confine himself to his \nroom, and two or three days afterwards had him taken into custody.  \nWith the same sort of caprice - and as capricious an old woman she \nnow was, as ever wore a crown or a head either - she sent him broth \nfrom her own table on his falling ill from anxiety, and cried about \nhim.\n\nHe was a man who could find comfort and occupation in his books, \nand he did so for a time; not the least happy time, I dare say, of \nhis life.  But it happened unfortunately for him, that he held a \nmonopoly in sweet wines:  which means that nobody could sell them \nwithout purchasing his permission.  This right, which was only for \na term, expiring, he applied to have it renewed.  The Queen \nrefused, with the rather strong observation - but she DID make \nstrong observations - that an unruly beast must be stinted in his \nfood.  Upon this, the angry Earl, who had been already deprived of \nmany offices, thought himself in danger of complete ruin, and \nturned against the Queen, whom he called a vain old woman who had \ngrown as crooked in her mind as she had in her figure.  These \nuncomplimentary expressions the ladies of the Court immediately \nsnapped up and carried to the Queen, whom they did not put in a \nbetter tempter, you may believe.  The same Court ladies, when they \nhad beautiful dark hair of their own, used to wear false red hair, \nto be like the Queen.  So they were not very high-spirited ladies, \nhowever high in rank.\n\nThe worst object of the Earl of Essex, and some friends of his who \nused to meet at LORD SOUTHAMPTON\'S house, was to obtain possession \nof the Queen, and oblige her by force to dismiss her ministers and \nchange her favourites.  On Saturday the seventh of February, one \nthousand six hundred and one, the council suspecting this, summoned \nthe Earl to come before them.  He, pretending to be ill, declined; \nit was then settled among his friends, that as the next day would \nbe Sunday, when many of the citizens usually assembled at the Cross \nby St. Paul\'s Cathedral, he should make one bold effort to induce \nthem to rise and follow him to the Palace.\n\nSo, on the Sunday morning, he and a small body of adherents started \nout of his house - Essex House by the Strand, with steps to the \nriver - having first shut up in it, as prisoners, some members of \nthe council who came to examine him - and hurried into the City \nwith the Earl at their head crying out \'For the Queen!  For the \nQueen!  A plot is laid for my life!\'  No one heeded them, however, \nand when they came to St. Paul\'s there were no citizens there.  In \nthe meantime the prisoners at Essex House had been released by one \nof the Earl\'s own friends; he had been promptly proclaimed a \ntraitor in the City itself; and the streets were barricaded with \ncarts and guarded by soldiers.  The Earl got back to his house by \nwater, with difficulty, and after an attempt to defend his house \nagainst the troops and cannon by which it was soon surrounded, gave \nhimself up that night.  He was brought to trial on the nineteenth, \nand found guilty; on the twenty-fifth, he was executed on Tower \nHill, where he died, at thirty-four years old, both courageously \nand penitently.  His step-father suffered with him.  His enemy, Sir \nWalter Raleigh, stood near the scaffold all the time - but not so \nnear it as we shall see him stand, before we finish his history.\n\nIn this case, as in the cases of the Duke of Norfolk and Mary Queen \nof Scots, the Queen had commanded, and countermanded, and again \ncommanded, the execution.  It is probable that the death of her \nyoung and gallant favourite in the prime of his good qualities, was \nnever off her mind afterwards, but she held out, the same vain, \nobstinate and capricious woman, for another year.  Then she danced \nbefore her Court on a state occasion - and cut, I should think, a \nmighty ridiculous figure, doing so in an immense ruff, stomacher \nand wig, at seventy years old.  For another year still, she held \nout, but, without any more dancing, and as a moody, sorrowful, \nbroken creature.  At last, on the tenth of March, one thousand six \nhundred and three, having been ill of a very bad cold, and made \nworse by the death of the Countess of Nottingham who was her \nintimate friend, she fell into a stupor and was supposed to be \ndead.  She recovered her consciousness, however, and then nothing \nwould induce her to go to bed; for she said that she knew that if \nshe did, she should never get up again.  There she lay for ten \ndays, on cushions on the floor, without any food, until the Lord \nAdmiral got her into bed at last, partly by persuasions and partly \nby main force.  When they asked her who should succeed her, she \nreplied that her seat had been the seat of Kings, and that she \nwould have for her successor, \'No rascal\'s son, but a King\'s.\'  \nUpon this, the lords present stared at one another, and took the \nliberty of asking whom she meant; to which she replied, \'Whom \nshould I mean, but our cousin of Scotland!\'  This was on the \ntwenty-third of March.  They asked her once again that day, after \nshe was speechless, whether she was still in the same mind?  She \nstruggled up in bed, and joined her hands over her head in the form \nof a crown, as the only reply she could make.  At three o\'clock \nnext morning, she very quietly died, in the forty-fifth year of her \nreign.\n\nThat reign had been a glorious one, and is made for ever memorable \nby the distinguished men who flourished in it.  Apart from the \ngreat voyagers, statesmen, and scholars, whom it produced, the \nnames of BACON, SPENSER, and SHAKESPEARE, will always be remembered \nwith pride and veneration by the civilised world, and will always \nimpart (though with no great reason, perhaps) some portion of their \nlustre to the name of Elizabeth herself.  It was a great reign for \ndiscovery, for commerce, and for English enterprise and spirit in \ngeneral.  It was a great reign for the Protestant religion and for \nthe Reformation which made England free.  The Queen was very \npopular, and in her progresses, or journeys about her dominions, \nwas everywhere received with the liveliest joy.  I think the truth \nis, that she was not half so good as she has been made out, and not \nhalf so bad as she has been made out.  She had her fine qualities, \nbut she was coarse, capricious, and treacherous, and had all the \nfaults of an excessively vain young woman long after she was an old \none.  On the whole, she had a great deal too much of her father in \nher, to please me.\n\nMany improvements and luxuries were introduced in the course of \nthese five-and-forty years in the general manner of living; but \ncock-fighting, bull-baiting, and bear-baiting, were still the \nnational amusements; and a coach was so rarely seen, and was such \nan ugly and cumbersome affair when it was seen, that even the Queen \nherself, on many high occasions, rode on horseback on a pillion \nbehind the Lord Chancellor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII - ENGLAND UNDER JAMES THE FIRST\n\n\n\n\'OUR cousin of Scotland\' was ugly, awkward, and shuffling both in \nmind and person.  His tongue was much too large for his mouth, his \nlegs were much too weak for his body, and his dull goggle-eyes \nstared and rolled like an idiot\'s.  He was cunning, covetous, \nwasteful, idle, drunken, greedy, dirty, cowardly, a great swearer, \nand the most conceited man on earth.  His figure - what is commonly \ncalled rickety from his birth - presented a most ridiculous \nappearance, dressed in thick padded clothes, as a safeguard against \nbeing stabbed (of which he lived in continual fear), of a grass-\ngreen colour from head to foot, with a hunting-horn dangling at his \nside instead of a sword, and his hat and feather sticking over one \neye, or hanging on the back of his head, as he happened to toss it \non.  He used to loll on the necks of his favourite courtiers, and \nslobber their faces, and kiss and pinch their cheeks; and the \ngreatest favourite he ever had, used to sign himself in his letters \nto his royal master, His Majesty\'s \'dog and slave,\' and used to \naddress his majesty as \'his Sowship.\'  His majesty was the worst \nrider ever seen, and thought himself the best.  He was one of the \nmost impertinent talkers (in the broadest Scotch) ever heard, and \nboasted of being unanswerable in all manner of argument.  He wrote \nsome of the most wearisome treatises ever read - among others, a \nbook upon witchcraft, in which he was a devout believer - and \nthought himself a prodigy of authorship.  He thought, and wrote, \nand said, that a king had a right to make and unmake what laws he \npleased, and ought to be accountable to nobody on earth.  This is \nthe plain, true character of the personage whom the greatest men \nabout the court praised and flattered to that degree, that I doubt \nif there be anything much more shameful in the annals of human \nnature.\n\nHe came to the English throne with great ease.  The miseries of a \ndisputed succession had been felt so long, and so dreadfully, that \nhe was proclaimed within a few hours of Elizabeth\'s death, and was \naccepted by the nation, even without being asked to give any pledge \nthat he would govern well, or that he would redress crying \ngrievances.  He took a month to come from Edinburgh to London; and, \nby way of exercising his new power, hanged a pickpocket on the \njourney without any trial, and knighted everybody he could lay hold \nof.  He made two hundred knights before he got to his palace in \nLondon, and seven hundred before he had been in it three months.  \nHe also shovelled sixty-two new peers into the House of Lords - and \nthere was a pretty large sprinkling of Scotchmen among them, you \nmay believe.\n\nHis Sowship\'s prime Minister, CECIL (for I cannot do better than \ncall his majesty what his favourite called him), was the enemy of \nSir Walter Raleigh, and also of Sir Walter\'s political friend, LORD \nCOBHAM; and his Sowship\'s first trouble was a plot originated by \nthese two, and entered into by some others, with the old object of \nseizing the King and keeping him in imprisonment until he should \nchange his ministers.  There were Catholic priests in the plot, and \nthere were Puritan noblemen too; for, although the Catholics and \nPuritans were strongly opposed to each other, they united at this \ntime against his Sowship, because they knew that he had a design \nagainst both, after pretending to be friendly to each; this design \nbeing to have only one high and convenient form of the Protestant \nreligion, which everybody should be bound to belong to, whether \nthey liked it or not.  This plot was mixed up with another, which \nmay or may not have had some reference to placing on the throne, at \nsome time, the LADY ARABELLA STUART; whose misfortune it was, to be \nthe daughter of the younger brother of his Sowship\'s father, but \nwho was quite innocent of any part in the scheme.  Sir Walter \nRaleigh was accused on the confession of Lord Cobham - a miserable \ncreature, who said one thing at one time, and another thing at \nanother time, and could be relied upon in nothing.  The trial of \nSir Walter Raleigh lasted from eight in the morning until nearly \nmidnight; he defended himself with such eloquence, genius, and \nspirit against all accusations, and against the insults of COKE, \nthe Attorney-General - who, according to the custom of the time, \nfoully abused him - that those who went there detesting the \nprisoner, came away admiring him, and declaring that anything so \nwonderful and so captivating was never heard.  He was found guilty, \nnevertheless, and sentenced to death.  Execution was deferred, and \nhe was taken to the Tower.  The two Catholic priests, less \nfortunate, were executed with the usual atrocity; and Lord Cobham \nand two others were pardoned on the scaffold.  His Sowship thought \nit wonderfully knowing in him to surprise the people by pardoning \nthese three at the very block; but, blundering, and bungling, as \nusual, he had very nearly overreached himself.  For, the messenger \non horseback who brought the pardon, came so late, that he was \npushed to the outside of the crowd, and was obliged to shout and \nroar out what he came for.  The miserable Cobham did not gain much \nby being spared that day.  He lived, both as a prisoner and a \nbeggar, utterly despised, and miserably poor, for thirteen years, \nand then died in an old outhouse belonging to one of his former \nservants.\n\nThis plot got rid of, and Sir Walter Raleigh safely shut up in the \nTower, his Sowship held a great dispute with the Puritans on their \npresenting a petition to him, and had it all his own way - not so \nvery wonderful, as he would talk continually, and would not hear \nanybody else - and filled the Bishops with admiration.  It was \ncomfortably settled that there was to be only one form of religion, \nand that all men were to think exactly alike.  But, although this \nwas arranged two centuries and a half ago, and although the \narrangement was supported by much fining and imprisonment, I do not \nfind that it is quite successful, even yet.\n\nHis Sowship, having that uncommonly high opinion of himself as a \nking, had a very low opinion of Parliament as a power that \naudaciously wanted to control him.  When he called his first \nParliament after he had been king a year, he accordingly thought he \nwould take pretty high ground with them, and told them that he \ncommanded them \'as an absolute king.\'  The Parliament thought those \nstrong words, and saw the necessity of upholding their authority.  \nHis Sowship had three children:  Prince Henry, Prince Charles, and \nthe Princess Elizabeth.  It would have been well for one of these, \nand we shall too soon see which, if he had learnt a little wisdom \nconcerning Parliaments from his father\'s obstinacy.\n\nNow, the people still labouring under their old dread of the \nCatholic religion, this Parliament revived and strengthened the \nsevere laws against it.  And this so angered ROBERT CATESBY, a \nrestless Catholic gentleman of an old family, that he formed one of \nthe most desperate and terrible designs ever conceived in the mind \nof man; no less a scheme than the Gunpowder Plot.\n\nHis object was, when the King, lords, and commons, should be \nassembled at the next opening of Parliament, to blow them up, one \nand all, with a great mine of gunpowder.  The first person to whom \nhe confided this horrible idea was THOMAS WINTER, a Worcestershire \ngentleman who had served in the army abroad, and had been secretly \nemployed in Catholic projects.  While Winter was yet undecided, and \nwhen he had gone over to the Netherlands, to learn from the Spanish \nAmbassador there whether there was any hope of Catholics being \nrelieved through the intercession of the King of Spain with his \nSowship, he found at Ostend a tall, dark, daring man, whom he had \nknown when they were both soldiers abroad, and whose name was GUIDO \n- or GUY - FAWKES.  Resolved to join the plot, he proposed it to \nthis man, knowing him to be the man for any desperate deed, and \nthey two came back to England together.  Here, they admitted two \nother conspirators; THOMAS PERCY, related to the Earl of \nNorthumberland, and JOHN WRIGHT, his brother-in-law.  All these met \ntogether in a solitary house in the open fields which were then \nnear Clement\'s Inn, now a closely blocked-up part of London; and \nwhen they had all taken a great oath of secrecy, Catesby told the \nrest what his plan was.  They then went up-stairs into a garret, \nand received the Sacrament from FATHER GERARD, a Jesuit, who is \nsaid not to have known actually of the Gunpowder Plot, but who, I \nthink, must have had his suspicions that there was something \ndesperate afoot.\n\nPercy was a Gentleman Pensioner, and as he had occasional duties to \nperform about the Court, then kept at Whitehall, there would be \nnothing suspicious in his living at Westminster.  So, having looked \nwell about him, and having found a house to let, the back of which \njoined the Parliament House, he hired it of a person named FERRIS, \nfor the purpose of undermining the wall.  Having got possession of \nthis house, the conspirators hired another on the Lambeth side of \nthe Thames, which they used as a storehouse for wood, gunpowder, \nand other combustible matters.  These were to be removed at night \n(and afterwards were removed), bit by bit, to the house at \nWestminster; and, that there might be some trusty person to keep \nwatch over the Lambeth stores, they admitted another conspirator, \nby name ROBERT KAY, a very poor Catholic gentleman.\n\nAll these arrangements had been made some months, and it was a \ndark, wintry, December night, when the conspirators, who had been \nin the meantime dispersed to avoid observation, met in the house at \nWestminster, and began to dig.  They had laid in a good stock of \neatables, to avoid going in and out, and they dug and dug with \ngreat ardour.  But, the wall being tremendously thick, and the work \nvery severe, they took into their plot CHRISTOPHER WRIGHT, a \nyounger brother of John Wright, that they might have a new pair of \nhands to help.  And Christopher Wright fell to like a fresh man, \nand they dug and dug by night and by day, and Fawkes stood sentinel \nall the time.  And if any man\'s heart seemed to fail him at all, \nFawkes said, \'Gentlemen, we have abundance of powder and shot here, \nand there is no fear of our being taken alive, even if discovered.\'  \nThe same Fawkes, who, in the capacity of sentinel, was always \nprowling about, soon picked up the intelligence that the King had \nprorogued the Parliament again, from the seventh of February, the \nday first fixed upon, until the third of October.  When the \nconspirators knew this, they agreed to separate until after the \nChristmas holidays, and to take no notice of each other in the \nmeanwhile, and never to write letters to one another on any \naccount.  So, the house in Westminster was shut up again, and I \nsuppose the neighbours thought that those strange-looking men who \nlived there so gloomily, and went out so seldom, were gone away to \nhave a merry Christmas somewhere.\n\nIt was the beginning of February, sixteen hundred and five, when \nCatesby met his fellow-conspirators again at this Westminster \nhouse.  He had now admitted three more; JOHN GRANT, a Warwickshire \ngentleman of a melancholy temper, who lived in a doleful house near \nStratford-upon-Avon, with a frowning wall all round it, and a deep \nmoat; ROBERT WINTER, eldest brother of Thomas; and Catesby\'s own \nservant, THOMAS BATES, who, Catesby thought, had had some suspicion \nof what his master was about.  These three had all suffered more or \nless for their religion in Elizabeth\'s time.  And now, they all \nbegan to dig again, and they dug and dug by night and by day.\n\nThey found it dismal work alone there, underground, with such a \nfearful secret on their minds, and so many murders before them.  \nThey were filled with wild fancies.  Sometimes, they thought they \nheard a great bell tolling, deep down in the earth under the \nParliament House; sometimes, they thought they heard low voices \nmuttering about the Gunpowder Plot; once in the morning, they \nreally did hear a great rumbling noise over their heads, as they \ndug and sweated in their mine.  Every man stopped and looked aghast \nat his neighbour, wondering what had happened, when that bold \nprowler, Fawkes, who had been out to look, came in and told them \nthat it was only a dealer in coals who had occupied a cellar under \nthe Parliament House, removing his stock in trade to some other \nplace.  Upon this, the conspirators, who with all their digging and \ndigging had not yet dug through the tremendously thick wall, \nchanged their plan; hired that cellar, which was directly under the \nHouse of Lords; put six-and-thirty barrels of gunpowder in it, and \ncovered them over with fagots and coals.  Then they all dispersed \nagain till September, when the following new conspirators were \nadmitted; SIR EDWARD BAYNHAM, of Gloucestershire; SIR EVERARD \nDIGBY, of Rutlandshire; AMBROSE ROOKWOOD, of Suffolk; FRANCIS \nTRESHAM, of Northamptonshire.  Most of these were rich, and were to \nassist the plot, some with money and some with horses on which the \nconspirators were to ride through the country and rouse the \nCatholics after the Parliament should be blown into air.\n\nParliament being again prorogued from the third of October to the \nfifth of November, and the conspirators being uneasy lest their \ndesign should have been found out, Thomas Winter said he would go \nup into the House of Lords on the day of the prorogation, and see \nhow matters looked.  Nothing could be better.  The unconscious \nCommissioners were walking about and talking to one another, just \nover the six-and-thirty barrels of gunpowder.  He came back and \ntold the rest so, and they went on with their preparations.  They \nhired a ship, and kept it ready in the Thames, in which Fawkes was \nto sail for Flanders after firing with a slow match the train that \nwas to explode the powder.  A number of Catholic gentlemen not in \nthe secret, were invited, on pretence of a hunting party, to meet \nSir Everard Digby at Dunchurch on the fatal day, that they might be \nready to act together.  And now all was ready.\n\nBut, now, the great wickedness and danger which had been all along \nat the bottom of this wicked plot, began to show itself.  As the \nfifth of November drew near, most of the conspirators, remembering \nthat they had friends and relations who would be in the House of \nLords that day, felt some natural relenting, and a wish to warn \nthem to keep away.  They were not much comforted by Catesby\'s \ndeclaring that in such a cause he would blow up his own son.  LORD \nMOUNTEAGLE, Tresham\'s brother-in-law, was certain to be in the \nhouse; and when Tresham found that he could not prevail upon the \nrest to devise any means of sparing their friends, he wrote a \nmysterious letter to this lord and left it at his lodging in the \ndusk, urging him to keep away from the opening of Parliament, \n\'since God and man had concurred to punish the wickedness of the \ntimes.\'  It contained the words \'that the Parliament should receive \na terrible blow, and yet should not see who hurt them.\'  And it \nadded, \'the danger is past, as soon as you have burnt the letter.\'\n\nThe ministers and courtiers made out that his Sowship, by a direct \nmiracle from Heaven, found out what this letter meant.  The truth \nis, that they were not long (as few men would be) in finding out \nfor themselves; and it was decided to let the conspirators alone, \nuntil the very day before the opening of Parliament.  That the \nconspirators had their fears, is certain; for, Tresham himself said \nbefore them all, that they were every one dead men; and, although \neven he did not take flight, there is reason to suppose that he had \nwarned other persons besides Lord Mounteagle.  However, they were \nall firm; and Fawkes, who was a man of iron, went down every day \nand night to keep watch in the cellar as usual.  He was there about \ntwo in the afternoon of the fourth, when the Lord Chamberlain and \nLord Mounteagle threw open the door and looked in.  \'Who are you, \nfriend?\' said they.  \'Why,\' said Fawkes, \'I am Mr. Percy\'s servant, \nand am looking after his store of fuel here.\'  \'Your master has \nlaid in a pretty good store,\' they returned, and shut the door, and \nwent away.  Fawkes, upon this, posted off to the other conspirators \nto tell them all was quiet, and went back and shut himself up in \nthe dark, black cellar again, where he heard the bell go twelve \no\'clock and usher in the fifth of November.  About two hours \nafterwards, he slowly opened the door, and came out to look about \nhim, in his old prowling way.  He was instantly seized and bound, \nby a party of soldiers under SIR THOMAS KNEVETT.  He had a watch \nupon him, some touchwood, some tinder, some slow matches; and there \nwas a dark lantern with a candle in it, lighted, behind the door.  \nHe had his boots and spurs on - to ride to the ship, I suppose - \nand it was well for the soldiers that they took him so suddenly.  \nIf they had left him but a moment\'s time to light a match, he \ncertainly would have tossed it in among the powder, and blown up \nhimself and them.\n\nThey took him to the King\'s bed-chamber first of all, and there the \nKing (causing him to be held very tight, and keeping a good way \noff), asked him how he could have the heart to intend to destroy so \nmany innocent people?  \'Because,\' said Guy Fawkes, \'desperate \ndiseases need desperate remedies.\'  To a little Scotch favourite, \nwith a face like a terrier, who asked him (with no particular \nwisdom) why he had collected so much gunpowder, he replied, because \nhe had meant to blow Scotchmen back to Scotland, and it would take \na deal of powder to do that.  Next day he was carried to the Tower, \nbut would make no confession.  Even after being horribly tortured, \nhe confessed nothing that the Government did not already know; \nthough he must have been in a fearful state - as his signature, \nstill preserved, in contrast with his natural hand-writing before \nhe was put upon the dreadful rack, most frightfully shows.  Bates, \na very different man, soon said the Jesuits had had to do with the \nplot, and probably, under the torture, would as readily have said \nanything.  Tresham, taken and put in the Tower too, made \nconfessions and unmade them, and died of an illness that was heavy \nupon him.  Rookwood, who had stationed relays of his own horses all \nthe way to Dunchurch, did not mount to escape until the middle of \nthe day, when the news of the plot was all over London.  On the \nroad, he came up with the two Wrights, Catesby, and Percy; and they \nall galloped together into Northamptonshire.  Thence to Dunchurch, \nwhere they found the proposed party assembled.  Finding, however, \nthat there had been a plot, and that it had been discovered, the \nparty disappeared in the course of the night, and left them alone \nwith Sir Everard Digby.  Away they all rode again, through \nWarwickshire and Worcestershire, to a house called Holbeach, on the \nborders of Staffordshire.  They tried to raise the Catholics on \ntheir way, but were indignantly driven off by them.  All this time \nthey were hotly pursued by the sheriff of Worcester, and a fast \nincreasing concourse of riders.  At last, resolving to defend \nthemselves at Holbeach, they shut themselves up in the house, and \nput some wet powder before the fire to dry.  But it blew up, and \nCatesby was singed and blackened, and almost killed, and some of \nthe others were sadly hurt.  Still, knowing that they must die, \nthey resolved to die there, and with only their swords in their \nhands appeared at the windows to be shot at by the sheriff and his \nassistants.  Catesby said to Thomas Winter, after Thomas had been \nhit in the right arm which dropped powerless by his side, \'Stand by \nme, Tom, and we will die together!\' - which they did, being shot \nthrough the body by two bullets from one gun.  John Wright, and \nChristopher Wright, and Percy, were also shot.  Rookwood and Digby \nwere taken:  the former with a broken arm and a wound in his body \ntoo.\n\nIt was the fifteenth of January, before the trial of Guy Fawkes, \nand such of the other conspirators as were left alive, came on.  \nThey were all found guilty, all hanged, drawn, and quartered:  \nsome, in St. Paul\'s Churchyard, on the top of Ludgate-hill; some, \nbefore the Parliament House.  A Jesuit priest, named HENRY GARNET, \nto whom the dreadful design was said to have been communicated, was \ntaken and tried; and two of his servants, as well as a poor priest \nwho was taken with him, were tortured without mercy.  He himself \nwas not tortured, but was surrounded in the Tower by tamperers and \ntraitors, and so was made unfairly to convict himself out of his \nown mouth.  He said, upon his trial, that he had done all he could \nto prevent the deed, and that he could not make public what had \nbeen told him in confession - though I am afraid he knew of the \nplot in other ways.  He was found guilty and executed, after a \nmanful defence, and the Catholic Church made a saint of him; some \nrich and powerful persons, who had had nothing to do with the \nproject, were fined and imprisoned for it by the Star Chamber; the \nCatholics, in general, who had recoiled with horror from the idea \nof the infernal contrivance, were unjustly put under more severe \nlaws than before; and this was the end of the Gunpowder Plot.\n\n\nSECOND PART\n\n\nHis Sowship would pretty willingly, I think, have blown the House \nof Commons into the air himself; for, his dread and jealousy of it \nknew no bounds all through his reign.  When he was hard pressed for \nmoney he was obliged to order it to meet, as he could get no money \nwithout it; and when it asked him first to abolish some of the \nmonopolies in necessaries of life which were a great grievance to \nthe people, and to redress other public wrongs, he flew into a rage \nand got rid of it again.  At one time he wanted it to consent to \nthe Union of England with Scotland, and quarrelled about that.  At \nanother time it wanted him to put down a most infamous Church \nabuse, called the High Commission Court, and he quarrelled with it \nabout that.  At another time it entreated him not to be quite so \nfond of his archbishops and bishops who made speeches in his praise \ntoo awful to be related, but to have some little consideration for \nthe poor Puritan clergy who were persecuted for preaching in their \nown way, and not according to the archbishops and bishops; and they \nquarrelled about that.  In short, what with hating the House of \nCommons, and pretending not to hate it; and what with now sending \nsome of its members who opposed him, to Newgate or to the Tower, \nand now telling the rest that they must not presume to make \nspeeches about the public affairs which could not possibly concern \nthem; and what with cajoling, and bullying, and fighting, and being \nfrightened; the House of Commons was the plague of his Sowship\'s \nexistence.  It was pretty firm, however, in maintaining its rights, \nand insisting that the Parliament should make the laws, and not the \nKing by his own single proclamations (which he tried hard to do); \nand his Sowship was so often distressed for money, in consequence, \nthat he sold every sort of title and public office as if they were \nmerchandise, and even invented a new dignity called a Baronetcy, \nwhich anybody could buy for a thousand pounds.\n\nThese disputes with his Parliaments, and his hunting, and his \ndrinking, and his lying in bed - for he was a great sluggard - \noccupied his Sowship pretty well.  The rest of his time he chiefly \npassed in hugging and slobbering his favourites.  The first of \nthese was SIR PHILIP HERBERT, who had no knowledge whatever, except \nof dogs, and horses, and hunting, but whom he soon made EARL OF \nMONTGOMERY.  The next, and a much more famous one, was ROBERT CARR, \nor KER (for it is not certain which was his right name), who came \nfrom the Border country, and whom he soon made VISCOUNT ROCHESTER, \nand afterwards, EARL OF SOMERSET.  The way in which his Sowship \ndoted on this handsome young man, is even more odious to think of, \nthan the way in which the really great men of England condescended \nto bow down before him.  The favourite\'s great friend was a certain \nSIR THOMAS OVERBURY, who wrote his love-letters for him, and \nassisted him in the duties of his many high places, which his own \nignorance prevented him from discharging.  But this same Sir Thomas \nhaving just manhood enough to dissuade the favourite from a wicked \nmarriage with the beautiful Countess of Essex, who was to get a \ndivorce from her husband for the purpose, the said Countess, in her \nrage, got Sir Thomas put into the Tower, and there poisoned him.  \nThen the favourite and this bad woman were publicly married by the \nKing\'s pet bishop, with as much to-do and rejoicing, as if he had \nbeen the best man, and she the best woman, upon the face of the \nearth.\n\nBut, after a longer sunshine than might have been expected - of \nseven years or so, that is to say - another handsome young man \nstarted up and eclipsed the EARL OF SOMERSET.  This was GEORGE \nVILLIERS, the youngest son of a Leicestershire gentleman:  who came \nto Court with all the Paris fashions on him, and could dance as \nwell as the best mountebank that ever was seen.  He soon danced \nhimself into the good graces of his Sowship, and danced the other \nfavourite out of favour.  Then, it was all at once discovered that \nthe Earl and Countess of Somerset had not deserved all those great \npromotions and mighty rejoicings, and they were separately tried \nfor the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, and for other crimes.  But, \nthe King was so afraid of his late favourite\'s publicly telling \nsome disgraceful things he knew of him - which he darkly threatened \nto do - that he was even examined with two men standing, one on \neither side of him, each with a cloak in his hand, ready to throw \nit over his head and stop his mouth if he should break out with \nwhat he had it in his power to tell.  So, a very lame affair was \npurposely made of the trial, and his punishment was an allowance of \nfour thousand pounds a year in retirement, while the Countess was \npardoned, and allowed to pass into retirement too.  They hated one \nanother by this time, and lived to revile and torment each other \nsome years.\n\nWhile these events were in progress, and while his Sowship was \nmaking such an exhibition of himself, from day to day and from year \nto year, as is not often seen in any sty, three remarkable deaths \ntook place in England.  The first was that of the Minister, Robert \nCecil, Earl of Salisbury, who was past sixty, and had never been \nstrong, being deformed from his birth.  He said at last that he had \nno wish to live; and no Minister need have had, with his experience \nof the meanness and wickedness of those disgraceful times.  The \nsecond was that of the Lady Arabella Stuart, who alarmed his \nSowship mightily, by privately marrying WILLIAM SEYMOUR, son of \nLORD BEAUCHAMP, who was a descendant of King Henry the Seventh, and \nwho, his Sowship thought, might consequently increase and \nstrengthen any claim she might one day set up to the throne.  She \nwas separated from her husband (who was put in the Tower) and \nthrust into a boat to be confined at Durham.  She escaped in a \nman\'s dress to get away in a French ship from Gravesend to France, \nbut unhappily missed her husband, who had escaped too, and was soon \ntaken.  She went raving mad in the miserable Tower, and died there \nafter four years.  The last, and the most important of these three \ndeaths, was that of Prince Henry, the heir to the throne, in the \nnineteenth year of his age.  He was a promising young prince, and \ngreatly liked; a quiet, well-conducted youth, of whom two very good \nthings are known:  first, that his father was jealous of him; \nsecondly, that he was the friend of Sir Walter Raleigh, languishing \nthrough all those years in the Tower, and often said that no man \nbut his father would keep such a bird in such a cage.  On the \noccasion of the preparations for the marriage of his sister the \nPrincess Elizabeth with a foreign prince (and an unhappy marriage \nit turned out), he came from Richmond, where he had been very ill, \nto greet his new brother-in-law, at the palace at Whitehall.  There \nhe played a great game at tennis, in his shirt, though it was very \ncold weather, and was seized with an alarming illness, and died \nwithin a fortnight of a putrid fever.  For this young prince Sir \nWalter Raleigh wrote, in his prison in the Tower, the beginning of \na History of the World:  a wonderful instance how little his \nSowship could do to confine a great man\'s mind, however long he \nmight imprison his body.\n\nAnd this mention of Sir Walter Raleigh, who had many faults, but \nwho never showed so many merits as in trouble and adversity, may \nbring me at once to the end of his sad story.  After an \nimprisonment in the Tower of twelve long years, he proposed to \nresume those old sea voyages of his, and to go to South America in \nsearch of gold.  His Sowship, divided between his wish to be on \ngood terms with the Spaniards through whose territory Sir Walter \nmust pass (he had long had an idea of marrying Prince Henry to a \nSpanish Princess), and his avaricious eagerness to get hold of the \ngold, did not know what to do.  But, in the end, he set Sir Walter \nfree, taking securities for his return; and Sir Walter fitted out \nan expedition at his own coast and, on the twenty-eighth of March, \none thousand six hundred and seventeen, sailed away in command of \none of its ships, which he ominously called the Destiny.  The \nexpedition failed; the common men, not finding the gold they had \nexpected, mutinied; a quarrel broke out between Sir Walter and the \nSpaniards, who hated him for old successes of his against them; and \nhe took and burnt a little town called SAINT THOMAS.  For this he \nwas denounced to his Sowship by the Spanish Ambassador as a pirate; \nand returning almost broken-hearted, with his hopes and fortunes \nshattered, his company of friends dispersed, and his brave son (who \nhad been one of them) killed, he was taken - through the treachery \nof SIR LEWIS STUKELY, his near relation, a scoundrel and a Vice-\nAdmiral - and was once again immured in his prison-home of so many \nyears.\n\nHis Sowship being mightily disappointed in not getting any gold, \nSir Walter Raleigh was tried as unfairly, and with as many lies and \nevasions as the judges and law officers and every other authority \nin Church and State habitually practised under such a King.  After \na great deal of prevarication on all parts but his own, it was \ndeclared that he must die under his former sentence, now fifteen \nyears old.  So, on the twenty-eighth of October, one thousand six \nhundred and eighteen, he was shut up in the Gate House at \nWestminster to pass his late night on earth, and there he took \nleave of his good and faithful lady who was worthy to have lived in \nbetter days.  At eight o\'clock next morning, after a cheerful \nbreakfast, and a pipe, and a cup of good wine, he was taken to Old \nPalace Yard in Westminster, where the scaffold was set up, and \nwhere so many people of high degree were assembled to see him die, \nthat it was a matter of some difficulty to get him through the \ncrowd.  He behaved most nobly, but if anything lay heavy on his \nmind, it was that Earl of Essex, whose head he had seen roll off; \nand he solemnly said that he had had no hand in bringing him to the \nblock, and that he had shed tears for him when he died.  As the \nmorning was very cold, the Sheriff said, would he come down to a \nfire for a little space, and warm himself?  But Sir Walter thanked \nhim, and said no, he would rather it were done at once, for he was \nill of fever and ague, and in another quarter of an hour his \nshaking fit would come upon him if he were still alive, and his \nenemies might then suppose that he trembled for fear.  With that, \nhe kneeled and made a very beautiful and Christian prayer.  Before \nhe laid his head upon the block he felt the edge of the axe, and \nsaid, with a smile upon his face, that it was a sharp medicine, but \nwould cure the worst disease.  When he was bent down ready for \ndeath, he said to the executioner, finding that he hesitated, \'What \ndost thou fear?  Strike, man!\'  So, the axe came down and struck \nhis head off, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.\n\nThe new favourite got on fast.  He was made a viscount, he was made \nDuke of Buckingham, he was made a marquis, he was made Master of \nthe Horse, he was made Lord High Admiral - and the Chief Commander \nof the gallant English forces that had dispersed the Spanish \nArmada, was displaced to make room for him.  He had the whole \nkingdom at his disposal, and his mother sold all the profits and \nhonours of the State, as if she had kept a shop.  He blazed all \nover with diamonds and other precious stones, from his hatband and \nhis earrings to his shoes.  Yet he was an ignorant presumptuous, \nswaggering compound of knave and fool, with nothing but his beauty \nand his dancing to recommend him.  This is the gentleman who called \nhimself his Majesty\'s dog and slave, and called his Majesty Your \nSowship.  His Sowship called him STEENIE; it is supposed, because \nthat was a nickname for Stephen, and because St. Stephen was \ngenerally represented in pictures as a handsome saint.\n\nHis Sowship was driven sometimes to his wits\'-end by his trimming \nbetween the general dislike of the Catholic religion at home, and \nhis desire to wheedle and flatter it abroad, as his only means of \ngetting a rich princess for his son\'s wife:  a part of whose \nfortune he might cram into his greasy pockets.  Prince Charles - or \nas his Sowship called him, Baby Charles - being now PRINCE OF \nWALES, the old project of a marriage with the Spanish King\'s \ndaughter had been revived for him; and as she could not marry a \nProtestant without leave from the Pope, his Sowship himself \nsecretly and meanly wrote to his Infallibility, asking for it.  The \nnegotiation for this Spanish marriage takes up a larger space in \ngreat books, than you can imagine, but the upshot of it all is, \nthat when it had been held off by the Spanish Court for a long \ntime, Baby Charles and Steenie set off in disguise as Mr. Thomas \nSmith and Mr. John Smith, to see the Spanish Princess; that Baby \nCharles pretended to be desperately in love with her, and jumped \noff walls to look at her, and made a considerable fool of himself \nin a good many ways; that she was called Princess of Wales and that \nthe whole Spanish Court believed Baby Charles to be all but dying \nfor her sake, as he expressly told them he was; that Baby Charles \nand Steenie came back to England, and were received with as much \nrapture as if they had been a blessing to it; that Baby Charles had \nactually fallen in love with HENRIETTA MARIA, the French King\'s \nsister, whom he had seen in Paris; that he thought it a wonderfully \nfine and princely thing to have deceived the Spaniards, all \nthrough; and that he openly said, with a chuckle, as soon as he was \nsafe and sound at home again, that the Spaniards were great fools \nto have believed him.\n\nLike most dishonest men, the Prince and the favourite complained \nthat the people whom they had deluded were dishonest.  They made \nsuch misrepresentations of the treachery of the Spaniards in this \nbusiness of the Spanish match, that the English nation became eager \nfor a war with them.  Although the gravest Spaniards laughed at the \nidea of his Sowship in a warlike attitude, the Parliament granted \nmoney for the beginning of hostilities, and the treaties with Spain \nwere publicly declared to be at an end.  The Spanish ambassador in \nLondon - probably with the help of the fallen favourite, the Earl \nof Somerset - being unable to obtain speech with his Sowship, \nslipped a paper into his hand, declaring that he was a prisoner in \nhis own house, and was entirely governed by Buckingham and his \ncreatures.  The first effect of this letter was that his Sowship \nbegan to cry and whine, and took Baby Charles away from Steenie, \nand went down to Windsor, gabbling all sorts of nonsense.  The end \nof it was that his Sowship hugged his dog and slave, and said he \nwas quite satisfied.\n\nHe had given the Prince and the favourite almost unlimited power to \nsettle anything with the Pope as to the Spanish marriage; and he \nnow, with a view to the French one, signed a treaty that all Roman \nCatholics in England should exercise their religion freely, and \nshould never be required to take any oath contrary thereto.  In \nreturn for this, and for other concessions much less to be \ndefended, Henrietta Maria was to become the Prince\'s wife, and was \nto bring him a fortune of eight hundred thousand crowns.\n\nHis Sowship\'s eyes were getting red with eagerly looking for the \nmoney, when the end of a gluttonous life came upon him; and, after \na fortnight\'s illness, on Sunday the twenty-seventh of March, one \nthousand six hundred and twenty-five, he died.  He had reigned \ntwenty-two years, and was fifty-nine years old.  I know of nothing \nmore abominable in history than the adulation that was lavished on \nthis King, and the vice and corruption that such a barefaced habit \nof lying produced in his court.  It is much to be doubted whether \none man of honour, and not utterly self-disgraced, kept his place \nnear James the First.  Lord Bacon, that able and wise philosopher, \nas the First Judge in the Kingdom in this reign, became a public \nspectacle of dishonesty and corruption; and in his base flattery of \nhis Sowship, and in his crawling servility to his dog and slave, \ndisgraced himself even more.  But, a creature like his Sowship set \nupon a throne is like the Plague, and everybody receives infection \nfrom him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII - ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE FIRST\n\n\n\nBABY CHARLES became KING CHARLES THE FIRST, in the twenty-fifth \nyear of his age.  Unlike his father, he was usually amiable in his \nprivate character, and grave and dignified in his bearing; but, \nlike his father, he had monstrously exaggerated notions of the \nrights of a king, and was evasive, and not to be trusted.  If his \nword could have been relied upon, his history might have had a \ndifferent end.\n\nHis first care was to send over that insolent upstart, Buckingham, \nto bring Henrietta Maria from Paris to be his Queen; upon which \noccasion Buckingham - with his usual audacity - made love to the \nyoung Queen of Austria, and was very indignant indeed with CARDINAL \nRICHELIEU, the French Minister, for thwarting his intentions.  The \nEnglish people were very well disposed to like their new Queen, and \nto receive her with great favour when she came among them as a \nstranger.  But, she held the Protestant religion in great dislike, \nand brought over a crowd of unpleasant priests, who made her do \nsome very ridiculous things, and forced themselves upon the public \nnotice in many disagreeable ways.  Hence, the people soon came to \ndislike her, and she soon came to dislike them; and she did so much \nall through this reign in setting the King (who was dotingly fond \nof her) against his subjects, that it would have been better for \nhim if she had never been born.\n\nNow, you are to understand that King Charles the First - of his own \ndetermination to be a high and mighty King not to be called to \naccount by anybody, and urged on by his Queen besides - \ndeliberately set himself to put his Parliament down and to put \nhimself up. You are also to understand, that even in pursuit of \nthis wrong idea (enough in itself to have ruined any king) he never \ntook a straight course, but always took a crooked one.\n\nHe was bent upon war with Spain, though neither the House of \nCommons nor the people were quite clear as to the justice of that \nwar, now that they began to think a little more about the story of \nthe Spanish match.  But the King rushed into it hotly, raised money \nby illegal means to meet its expenses, and encountered a miserable \nfailure at Cadiz, in the very first year of his reign.  An \nexpedition to Cadiz had been made in the hope of plunder, but as it \nwas not successful, it was necessary to get a grant of money from \nthe Parliament; and when they met, in no very complying humour, \nthe, King told them, \'to make haste to let him have it, or it would \nbe the worse for themselves.\'  Not put in a more complying humour \nby this, they impeached the King\'s favourite, the Duke of \nBuckingham, as the cause (which he undoubtedly was) of many great \npublic grievances and wrongs.  The King, to save him, dissolved the \nParliament without getting the money he wanted; and when the Lords \nimplored him to consider and grant a little delay, he replied, \'No, \nnot one minute.\'  He then began to raise money for himself by the \nfollowing means among others.\n\nHe levied certain duties called tonnage and poundage which had not \nbeen granted by the Parliament, and could lawfully be levied by no \nother power; he called upon the seaport towns to furnish, and to \npay all the cost for three months of, a fleet of armed ships; and \nhe required the people to unite in lending him large sums of money, \nthe repayment of which was very doubtful.  If the poor people \nrefused, they were pressed as soldiers or sailors; if the gentry \nrefused, they were sent to prison.  Five gentlemen, named SIR \nTHOMAS DARNEL, JOHN CORBET, WALTER EARL, JOHN HEVENINGHAM, and \nEVERARD HAMPDEN, for refusing were taken up by a warrant of the \nKing\'s privy council, and were sent to prison without any cause but \nthe King\'s pleasure being stated for their imprisonment.  Then the \nquestion came to be solemnly tried, whether this was not a \nviolation of Magna Charta, and an encroachment by the King on the \nhighest rights of the English people.  His lawyers contended No, \nbecause to encroach upon the rights of the English people would be \nto do wrong, and the King could do no wrong.  The accommodating \njudges decided in favour of this wicked nonsense; and here was a \nfatal division between the King and the people.\n\nFor all this, it became necessary to call another Parliament.  The \npeople, sensible of the danger in which their liberties were, chose \nfor it those who were best known for their determined opposition to \nthe King; but still the King, quite blinded by his determination to \ncarry everything before him, addressed them when they met, in a \ncontemptuous manner, and just told them in so many words that he \nhad only called them together because he wanted money.  The \nParliament, strong enough and resolute enough to know that they \nwould lower his tone, cared little for what he said, and laid \nbefore him one of the great documents of history, which is called \nthe PETITION OF RIGHT, requiring that the free men of England \nshould no longer be called upon to lend the King money, and should \nno longer be pressed or imprisoned for refusing to do so; further, \nthat the free men of England should no longer be seized by the \nKing\'s special mandate or warrant, it being contrary to their \nrights and liberties and the laws of their country.  At first the \nKing returned an answer to this petition, in which he tried to \nshirk it altogether; but, the House of Commons then showing their \ndetermination to go on with the impeachment of Buckingham, the King \nin alarm returned an answer, giving his consent to all that was \nrequired of him.  He not only afterwards departed from his word and \nhonour on these points, over and over again, but, at this very \ntime, he did the mean and dissembling act of publishing his first \nanswer and not his second - merely that the people might suppose \nthat the Parliament had not got the better of him.\n\nThat pestilent Buckingham, to gratify his own wounded vanity, had \nby this time involved the country in war with France, as well as \nwith Spain.  For such miserable causes and such miserable creatures \nare wars sometimes made!  But he was destined to do little more \nmischief in this world.  One morning, as he was going out of his \nhouse to his carriage, he turned to speak to a certain Colonel \nFRYER who was with him; and he was violently stabbed with a knife, \nwhich the murderer left sticking in his heart.  This happened in \nhis hall.  He had had angry words up-stairs, just before, with some \nFrench gentlemen, who were immediately suspected by his servants, \nand had a close escape from being set upon and killed.  In the \nmidst of the noise, the real murderer, who had gone to the kitchen \nand might easily have got away, drew his sword and cried out, \'I am \nthe man!\'  His name was JOHN FELTON, a Protestant and a retired \nofficer in the army.  He said he had had no personal ill-will to \nthe Duke, but had killed him as a curse to the country.  He had \naimed his blow well, for Buckingham had only had time to cry out, \n\'Villain!\' and then he drew out the knife, fell against a table, \nand died.\n\nThe council made a mighty business of examining John Felton about \nthis murder, though it was a plain case enough, one would think.  \nHe had come seventy miles to do it, he told them, and he did it for \nthe reason he had declared; if they put him upon the rack, as that \nnoble MARQUIS OF DORSET whom he saw before him, had the goodness to \nthreaten, he gave that marquis warning, that he would accuse HIM as \nhis accomplice!  The King was unpleasantly anxious to have him \nracked, nevertheless; but as the judges now found out that torture \nwas contrary to the law of England - it is a pity they did not make \nthe discovery a little sooner - John Felton was simply executed for \nthe murder he had done.  A murder it undoubtedly was, and not in \nthe least to be defended:  though he had freed England from one of \nthe most profligate, contemptible, and base court favourites to \nwhom it has ever yielded.\n\nA very different man now arose.  This was SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH, a \nYorkshire gentleman, who had sat in Parliament for a long time, and \nwho had favoured arbitrary and haughty principles, but who had gone \nover to the people\'s side on receiving offence from Buckingham.  \nThe King, much wanting such a man - for, besides being naturally \nfavourable to the King\'s cause, he had great abilities - made him \nfirst a Baron, and then a Viscount, and gave him high employment, \nand won him most completely.\n\nA Parliament, however, was still in existence, and was NOT to be \nwon.  On the twentieth of January, one thousand six hundred and \ntwenty-nine, SIR JOHN ELIOT, a great man who had been active in the \nPetition of Right, brought forward other strong resolutions against \nthe King\'s chief instruments, and called upon the Speaker to put \nthem to the vote.  To this the Speaker answered, \'he was commanded \notherwise by the King,\' and got up to leave the chair - which, \naccording to the rules of the House of Commons would have obliged \nit to adjourn without doing anything more - when two members, named \nMr. HOLLIS and Mr. VALENTINE, held him down.  A scene of great \nconfusion arose among the members; and while many swords were drawn \nand flashing about, the King, who was kept informed of all that was \ngoing on, told the captain of his guard to go down to the House and \nforce the doors.  The resolutions were by that time, however, \nvoted, and the House adjourned.  Sir John Eliot and those two \nmembers who had held the Speaker down, were quickly summoned before \nthe council.  As they claimed it to be their privilege not to \nanswer out of Parliament for anything they had said in it, they \nwere committed to the Tower.  The King then went down and dissolved \nthe Parliament, in a speech wherein he made mention of these \ngentlemen as \'Vipers\' - which did not do him much good that ever I \nhave heard of.\n\nAs they refused to gain their liberty by saying they were sorry for \nwhat they had done, the King, always remarkably unforgiving, never \noverlooked their offence.  When they demanded to be brought up \nbefore the court of King\'s Bench, he even resorted to the meanness \nof having them moved about from prison to prison, so that the writs \nissued for that purpose should not legally find them.  At last they \ncame before the court and were sentenced to heavy fines, and to be \nimprisoned during the King\'s pleasure.  When Sir John Eliot\'s \nhealth had quite given way, and he so longed for change of air and \nscene as to petition for his release, the King sent back the answer \n(worthy of his Sowship himself) that the petition was not humble \nenough.  When he sent another petition by his young son, in which \nhe pathetically offered to go back to prison when his health was \nrestored, if he might be released for its recovery, the King still \ndisregarded it.  When he died in the Tower, and his children \npetitioned to be allowed to take his body down to Cornwall, there \nto lay it among the ashes of his forefathers, the King returned for \nanswer, \'Let Sir John Eliot\'s body be buried in the church of that \nparish where he died.\'  All this was like a very little King \nindeed, I think.\n\nAnd now, for twelve long years, steadily pursuing his design of \nsetting himself up and putting the people down, the King called no \nParliament; but ruled without one.  If twelve thousand volumes were \nwritten in his praise (as a good many have been) it would still \nremain a fact, impossible to be denied, that for twelve years King \nCharles the First reigned in England unlawfully and despotically, \nseized upon his subjects\' goods and money at his pleasure, and \npunished according to his unbridled will all who ventured to oppose \nhim.  It is a fashion with some people to think that this King\'s \ncareer was cut short; but I must say myself that I think he ran a \npretty long one.\n\nWILLIAM LAUD, Archbishop of Canterbury, was the King\'s right-hand \nman in the religious part of the putting down of the people\'s \nliberties.  Laud, who was a sincere man, of large learning but \nsmall sense - for the two things sometimes go together in very \ndifferent quantities - though a Protestant, held opinions so near \nthose of the Catholics, that the Pope wanted to make a Cardinal of \nhim, if he would have accepted that favour.  He looked upon vows, \nrobes, lighted candles, images, and so forth, as amazingly \nimportant in religious ceremonies; and he brought in an immensity \nof bowing and candle-snuffing.  He also regarded archbishops and \nbishops as a sort of miraculous persons, and was inveterate in the \nlast degree against any who thought otherwise.  Accordingly, he \noffered up thanks to Heaven, and was in a state of much pious \npleasure, when a Scotch clergyman, named LEIGHTON, was pilloried, \nwhipped, branded in the cheek, and had one of his ears cut off and \none of his nostrils slit, for calling bishops trumpery and the \ninventions of men.  He originated on a Sunday morning the \nprosecution of WILLIAM PRYNNE, a barrister who was of similar \nopinions, and who was fined a thousand pounds; who was pilloried; \nwho had his ears cut off on two occasions - one ear at a time - and \nwho was imprisoned for life.  He highly approved of the punishment \nof DOCTOR BASTWICK, a physician; who was also fined a thousand \npounds; and who afterwards had HIS ears cut off, and was imprisoned \nfor life.  These were gentle methods of persuasion, some will tell \nyou:  I think, they were rather calculated to be alarming to the \npeople.\n\nIn the money part of the putting down of the people\'s liberties, \nthe King was equally gentle, as some will tell you:  as I think, \nequally alarming.  He levied those duties of tonnage and poundage, \nand increased them as he thought fit.  He granted monopolies to \ncompanies of merchants on their paying him for them, \nnotwithstanding the great complaints that had, for years and years, \nbeen made on the subject of monopolies.  He fined the people for \ndisobeying proclamations issued by his Sowship in direct violation \nof law.  He revived the detested Forest laws, and took private \nproperty to himself as his forest right.  Above all, he determined \nto have what was called Ship Money; that is to say, money for the \nsupport of the fleet - not only from the seaports, but from all the \ncounties of England:  having found out that, in some ancient time \nor other, all the counties paid it.  The grievance of this ship \nmoney being somewhat too strong, JOHN CHAMBERS, a citizen of \nLondon, refused to pay his part of it.  For this the Lord Mayor \nordered John Chambers to prison, and for that John Chambers brought \na suit against the Lord Mayor.  LORD SAY, also, behaved like a real \nnobleman, and declared he would not pay.  But, the sturdiest and \nbest opponent of the ship money was JOHN HAMPDEN, a gentleman of \nBuckinghamshire, who had sat among the \'vipers\' in the House of \nCommons when there was such a thing, and who had been the bosom \nfriend of Sir John Eliot.  This case was tried before the twelve \njudges in the Court of Exchequer, and again the King\'s lawyers said \nit was impossible that ship money could be wrong, because the King \ncould do no wrong, however hard he tried - and he really did try \nvery hard during these twelve years.  Seven of the judges said that \nwas quite true, and Mr. Hampden was bound to pay:  five of the \njudges said that was quite false, and Mr. Hampden was not bound to \npay.  So, the King triumphed (as he thought), by making Hampden the \nmost popular man in England; where matters were getting to that \nheight now, that many honest Englishmen could not endure their \ncountry, and sailed away across the seas to found a colony in \nMassachusetts Bay in America.  It is said that Hampden himself and \nhis relation OLIVER CROMWELL were going with a company of such \nvoyagers, and were actually on board ship, when they were stopped \nby a proclamation, prohibiting sea captains to carry out such \npassengers without the royal license.  But O! it would have been \nwell for the King if he had let them go!  This was the state of \nEngland.  If Laud had been a madman just broke loose, he could not \nhave done more mischief than he did in Scotland.  In his endeavours \n(in which he was seconded by the King, then in person in that part \nof his dominions) to force his own ideas of bishops, and his own \nreligious forms and ceremonies upon the Scotch, he roused that \nnation to a perfect frenzy.  They formed a solemn league, which \nthey called The Covenant, for the preservation of their own \nreligious forms; they rose in arms throughout the whole country; \nthey summoned all their men to prayers and sermons twice a day by \nbeat of drum; they sang psalms, in which they compared their \nenemies to all the evil spirits that ever were heard of; and they \nsolemnly vowed to smite them with the sword.  At first the King \ntried force, then treaty, then a Scottish Parliament which did not \nanswer at all.  Then he tried the EARL OF STRAFFORD, formerly Sir \nThomas Wentworth; who, as LORD WENTWORTH, had been governing \nIreland.  He, too, had carried it with a very high hand there, \nthough to the benefit and prosperity of that country.\n\nStrafford and Laud were for conquering the Scottish people by force \nof arms.  Other lords who were taken into council, recommended that \na Parliament should at last be called; to which the King \nunwillingly consented.  So, on the thirteenth of April, one \nthousand six hundred and forty, that then strange sight, a \nParliament, was seen at Westminster.  It is called the Short \nParliament, for it lasted a very little while.  While the members \nwere all looking at one another, doubtful who would dare to speak, \nMR. PYM arose and set forth all that the King had done unlawfully \nduring the past twelve years, and what was the position to which \nEngland was reduced.  This great example set, other members took \ncourage and spoke the truth freely, though with great patience and \nmoderation.  The King, a little frightened, sent to say that if \nthey would grant him a certain sum on certain terms, no more ship \nmoney should be raised.  They debated the matter for two days; and \nthen, as they would not give him all he asked without promise or \ninquiry, he dissolved them.\n\nBut they knew very well that he must have a Parliament now; and he \nbegan to make that discovery too, though rather late in the day.  \nWherefore, on the twenty-fourth of September, being then at York \nwith an army collected against the Scottish people, but his own men \nsullen and discontented like the rest of the nation, the King told \nthe great council of the Lords, whom he had called to meet him \nthere, that he would summon another Parliament to assemble on the \nthird of November.  The soldiers of the Covenant had now forced \ntheir way into England and had taken possession of the northern \ncounties, where the coals are got.  As it would never do to be \nwithout coals, and as the King\'s troops could make no head against \nthe Covenanters so full of gloomy zeal, a truce was made, and a \ntreaty with Scotland was taken into consideration.  Meanwhile the \nnorthern counties paid the Covenanters to leave the coals alone, \nand keep quiet.\n\nWe have now disposed of the Short Parliament.  We have next to see \nwhat memorable things were done by the Long one.\n\n\nSECOND PART\n\n\nTHE Long Parliament assembled on the third of November, one \nthousand six hundred and forty-one.  That day week the Earl of \nStrafford arrived from York, very sensible that the spirited and \ndetermined men who formed that Parliament were no friends towards \nhim, who had not only deserted the cause of the people, but who had \non all occasions opposed himself to their liberties.  The King told \nhim, for his comfort, that the Parliament \'should not hurt one hair \nof his head.\'  But, on the very next day Mr. Pym, in the House of \nCommons, and with great solemnity, impeached the Earl of Strafford \nas a traitor.  He was immediately taken into custody and fell from \nhis proud height.\n\nIt was the twenty-second of March before he was brought to trial in \nWestminster Hall; where, although he was very ill and suffered \ngreat pain, he defended himself with such ability and majesty, that \nit was doubtful whether he would not get the best of it.  But on \nthe thirteenth day of the trial, Pym produced in the House of \nCommons a copy of some notes of a council, found by young SIR HARRY \nVANE in a red velvet cabinet belonging to his father (Secretary \nVane, who sat at the council-table with the Earl), in which \nStrafford had distinctly told the King that he was free from all \nrules and obligations of government, and might do with his people \nwhatever he liked; and in which he had added - \'You have an army in \nIreland that you may employ to reduce this kingdom to obedience.\'  \nIt was not clear whether by the words \'this kingdom,\' he had really \nmeant England or Scotland; but the Parliament contended that he \nmeant England, and this was treason.  At the same sitting of the \nHouse of Commons it was resolved to bring in a bill of attainder \ndeclaring the treason to have been committed:  in preference to \nproceeding with the trial by impeachment, which would have required \nthe treason to be proved.\n\nSo, a bill was brought in at once, was carried through the House of \nCommons by a large majority, and was sent up to the House of Lords.  \nWhile it was still uncertain whether the House of Lords would pass \nit and the King consent to it, Pym disclosed to the House of \nCommons that the King and Queen had both been plotting with the \nofficers of the army to bring up the soldiers and control the \nParliament, and also to introduce two hundred soldiers into the \nTower of London to effect the Earl\'s escape.  The plotting with the \narmy was revealed by one GEORGE GORING, the son of a lord of that \nname:  a bad fellow who was one of the original plotters, and \nturned traitor.  The King had actually given his warrant for the \nadmission of the two hundred men into the Tower, and they would \nhave got in too, but for the refusal of the governor - a sturdy \nScotchman of the name of BALFOUR - to admit them.  These matters \nbeing made public, great numbers of people began to riot outside \nthe Houses of Parliament, and to cry out for the execution of the \nEarl of Strafford, as one of the King\'s chief instruments against \nthem.  The bill passed the House of Lords while the people were in \nthis state of agitation, and was laid before the King for his \nassent, together with another bill declaring that the Parliament \nthen assembled should not be dissolved or adjourned without their \nown consent.  The King - not unwilling to save a faithful servant, \nthough he had no great attachment for him - was in some doubt what \nto do; but he gave his consent to both bills, although he in his \nheart believed that the bill against the Earl of Strafford was \nunlawful and unjust.  The Earl had written to him, telling him that \nhe was willing to die for his sake.  But he had not expected that \nhis royal master would take him at his word quite so readily; for, \nwhen he heard his doom, he laid his hand upon his heart, and said, \n\'Put not your trust in Princes!\'\n\nThe King, who never could be straightforward and plain, through one \nsingle day or through one single sheet of paper, wrote a letter to \nthe Lords, and sent it by the young Prince of Wales, entreating \nthem to prevail with the Commons that \'that unfortunate man should \nfulfil the natural course of his life in a close imprisonment.\'  In \na postscript to the very same letter, he added, \'If he must die, it \nwere charity to reprieve him till Saturday.\'  If there had been any \ndoubt of his fate, this weakness and meanness would have settled \nit.  The very next day, which was the twelfth of May, he was \nbrought out to be beheaded on Tower Hill.\n\nArchbishop Laud, who had been so fond of having people\'s ears \ncropped off and their noses slit, was now confined in the Tower \ntoo; and when the Earl went by his window to his death, he was \nthere, at his request, to give him his blessing.  They had been \ngreat friends in the King\'s cause, and the Earl had written to him \nin the days of their power that he thought it would be an admirable \nthing to have Mr. Hampden publicly whipped for refusing to pay the \nship money.  However, those high and mighty doings were over now, \nand the Earl went his way to death with dignity and heroism.  The \ngovernor wished him to get into a coach at the Tower gate, for fear \nthe people should tear him to pieces; but he said it was all one to \nhim whether he died by the axe or by the people\'s hands.  So, he \nwalked, with a firm tread and a stately look, and sometimes pulled \noff his hat to them as he passed along.  They were profoundly \nquiet.  He made a speech on the scaffold from some notes he had \nprepared (the paper was found lying there after his head was struck \noff), and one blow of the axe killed him, in the forty-ninth year \nof his age.\n\nThis bold and daring act, the Parliament accompanied by other \nfamous measures, all originating (as even this did) in the King\'s \nhaving so grossly and so long abused his power.  The name of \nDELINQUENTS was applied to all sheriffs and other officers who had \nbeen concerned in raising the ship money, or any other money, from \nthe people, in an unlawful manner; the Hampden judgment was \nreversed; the judges who had decided against Hampden were called \nupon to give large securities that they would take such \nconsequences as Parliament might impose upon them; and one was \narrested as he sat in High Court, and carried off to prison.  Laud \nwas impeached; the unfortunate victims whose ears had been cropped \nand whose noses had been slit, were brought out of prison in \ntriumph; and a bill was passed declaring that a Parliament should \nbe called every third year, and that if the King and the King\'s \nofficers did not call it, the people should assemble of themselves \nand summon it, as of their own right and power.  Great \nilluminations and rejoicings took place over all these things, and \nthe country was wildly excited.  That the Parliament took advantage \nof this excitement and stirred them up by every means, there is no \ndoubt; but you are always to remember those twelve long years, \nduring which the King had tried so hard whether he really could do \nany wrong or not.\n\nAll this time there was a great religious outcry against the right \nof the Bishops to sit in Parliament; to which the Scottish people \nparticularly objected.  The English were divided on this subject, \nand, partly on this account and partly because they had had foolish \nexpectations that the Parliament would be able to take off nearly \nall the taxes, numbers of them sometimes wavered and inclined \ntowards the King.\n\nI believe myself, that if, at this or almost any other period of \nhis life, the King could have been trusted by any man not out of \nhis senses, he might have saved himself and kept his throne.  But, \non the English army being disbanded, he plotted with the officers \nagain, as he had done before, and established the fact beyond all \ndoubt by putting his signature of approval to a petition against \nthe Parliamentary leaders, which was drawn up by certain officers.  \nWhen the Scottish army was disbanded, he went to Edinburgh in four \ndays - which was going very fast at that time - to plot again, and \nso darkly too, that it is difficult to decide what his whole object \nwas.  Some suppose that he wanted to gain over the Scottish \nParliament, as he did in fact gain over, by presents and favours, \nmany Scottish lords and men of power.  Some think that he went to \nget proofs against the Parliamentary leaders in England of their \nhaving treasonably invited the Scottish people to come and help \nthem.  With whatever object he went to Scotland, he did little good \nby going.  At the instigation of the EARL OF MONTROSE, a desperate \nman who was then in prison for plotting, he tried to kidnap three \nScottish lords who escaped.  A committee of the Parliament at home, \nwho had followed to watch him, writing an account of this INCIDENT, \nas it was called, to the Parliament, the Parliament made a fresh \nstir about it; were, or feigned to be, much alarmed for themselves; \nand wrote to the EARL OF ESSEX, the commander-in-chief, for a guard \nto protect them.\n\nIt is not absolutely proved that the King plotted in Ireland \nbesides, but it is very probable that he did, and that the Queen \ndid, and that he had some wild hope of gaining the Irish people \nover to his side by favouring a rise among them.  Whether or no, \nthey did rise in a most brutal and savage rebellion; in which, \nencouraged by their priests, they committed such atrocities upon \nnumbers of the English, of both sexes and of all ages, as nobody \ncould believe, but for their being related on oath by eye-\nwitnesses.  Whether one hundred thousand or two hundred thousand \nProtestants were murdered in this outbreak, is uncertain; but, that \nit was as ruthless and barbarous an outbreak as ever was known \namong any savage people, is certain.\n\nThe King came home from Scotland, determined to make a great \nstruggle for his lost power.  He believed that, through his \npresents and favours, Scotland would take no part against him; and \nthe Lord Mayor of London received him with such a magnificent \ndinner that he thought he must have become popular again in \nEngland.  It would take a good many Lord Mayors, however, to make a \npeople, and the King soon found himself mistaken.\n\nNot so soon, though, but that there was a great opposition in the \nParliament to a celebrated paper put forth by Pym and Hampden and \nthe rest, called \'THE REMONSTRANCE,\' which set forth all the \nillegal acts that the King had ever done, but politely laid the \nblame of them on his bad advisers.  Even when it was passed and \npresented to him, the King still thought himself strong enough to \ndischarge Balfour from his command in the Tower, and to put in his \nplace a man of bad character; to whom the Commons instantly \nobjected, and whom he was obliged to abandon.  At this time, the \nold outcry about the Bishops became louder than ever, and the old \nArchbishop of York was so near being murdered as he went down to \nthe House of Lords - being laid hold of by the mob and violently \nknocked about, in return for very foolishly scolding a shrill boy \nwho was yelping out \'No Bishops!\' - that he sent for all the \nBishops who were in town, and proposed to them to sign a \ndeclaration that, as they could no longer without danger to their \nlives attend their duty in Parliament, they protested against the \nlawfulness of everything done in their absence.  This they asked \nthe King to send to the House of Lords, which he did.  Then the \nHouse of Commons impeached the whole party of Bishops and sent them \noff to the Tower:\n\nTaking no warning from this; but encouraged by there being a \nmoderate party in the Parliament who objected to these strong \nmeasures, the King, on the third of January, one thousand six \nhundred and forty-two, took the rashest step that ever was taken by \nmortal man.\n\nOf his own accord and without advice, he sent the Attorney-General \nto the House of Lords, to accuse of treason certain members of \nParliament who as popular leaders were the most obnoxious to him; \nLORD KIMBOLTON, SIR ARTHUR HASELRIG, DENZIL HOLLIS, JOHN PYM (they \nused to call him King Pym, he possessed such power and looked so \nbig), JOHN HAMPDEN, and WILLIAM STRODE.  The houses of those \nmembers he caused to be entered, and their papers to be sealed up.  \nAt the same time, he sent a messenger to the House of Commons \ndemanding to have the five gentlemen who were members of that House \nimmediately produced.  To this the House replied that they should \nappear as soon as there was any legal charge against them, and \nimmediately adjourned.\n\nNext day, the House of Commons send into the City to let the Lord \nMayor know that their privileges are invaded by the King, and that \nthere is no safety for anybody or anything.  Then, when the five \nmembers are gone out of the way, down comes the King himself, with \nall his guard and from two to three hundred gentlemen and soldiers, \nof whom the greater part were armed.  These he leaves in the hall; \nand then, with his nephew at his side, goes into the House, takes \noff his hat, and walks up to the Speaker\'s chair.  The Speaker \nleaves it, the King stands in front of it, looks about him steadily \nfor a little while, and says he has come for those five members.  \nNo one speaks, and then he calls John Pym by name.  No one speaks, \nand then he calls Denzil Hollis by name.  No one speaks, and then \nhe asks the Speaker of the House where those five members are?  The \nSpeaker, answering on his knee, nobly replies that he is the \nservant of that House, and that he has neither eyes to see, nor \ntongue to speak, anything but what the House commands him.  Upon \nthis, the King, beaten from that time evermore, replies that he \nwill seek them himself, for they have committed treason; and goes \nout, with his hat in his hand, amid some audible murmurs from the \nmembers.\n\nNo words can describe the hurry that arose out of doors when all \nthis was known.  The five members had gone for safety to a house in \nColeman-street, in the City, where they were guarded all night; and \nindeed the whole city watched in arms like an army.  At ten o\'clock \nin the morning, the King, already frightened at what he had done, \ncame to the Guildhall, with only half a dozen lords, and made a \nspeech to the people, hoping they would not shelter those whom he \naccused of treason.  Next day, he issued a proclamation for the \napprehension of the five members; but the Parliament minded it so \nlittle that they made great arrangements for having them brought \ndown to Westminster in great state, five days afterwards.  The King \nwas so alarmed now at his own imprudence, if not for his own \nsafety, that he left his palace at Whitehall, and went away with \nhis Queen and children to Hampton Court.\n\nIt was the eleventh of May, when the five members were carried in \nstate and triumph to Westminster.  They were taken by water.  The \nriver could not be seen for the boats on it; and the five members \nwere hemmed in by barges full of men and great guns, ready to \nprotect them, at any cost.  Along the Strand a large body of the \ntrain-bands of London, under their commander, SKIPPON, marched to \nbe ready to assist the little fleet.  Beyond them, came a crowd who \nchoked the streets, roaring incessantly about the Bishops and the \nPapists, and crying out contemptuously as they passed Whitehall, \n\'What has become of the King?\'  With this great noise outside the \nHouse of Commons, and with great silence within, Mr. Pym rose and \ninformed the House of the great kindness with which they had been \nreceived in the City.  Upon that, the House called the sheriffs in \nand thanked them, and requested the train-bands, under their \ncommander Skippon, to guard the House of Commons every day.  Then, \ncame four thousand men on horseback out of Buckinghamshire, \noffering their services as a guard too, and bearing a petition to \nthe King, complaining of the injury that had been done to Mr. \nHampden, who was their county man and much beloved and honoured.\n\nWhen the King set off for Hampton Court, the gentlemen and soldiers \nwho had been with him followed him out of town as far as Kingston-\nupon-Thames; next day, Lord Digby came to them from the King at \nHampton Court, in his coach and six, to inform them that the King \naccepted their protection.  This, the Parliament said, was making \nwar against the kingdom, and Lord Digby fled abroad.  The \nParliament then immediately applied themselves to getting hold of \nthe military power of the country, well knowing that the King was \nalready trying hard to use it against them, and that he had \nsecretly sent the Earl of Newcastle to Hull, to secure a valuable \nmagazine of arms and gunpowder that was there.  In those times, \nevery county had its own magazines of arms and powder, for its own \ntrain-bands or militia; so, the Parliament brought in a bill \nclaiming the right (which up to this time had belonged to the King) \nof appointing the Lord Lieutenants of counties, who commanded these \ntrain-bands; also, of having all the forts, castles, and garrisons \nin the kingdom, put into the hands of such governors as they, the \nParliament, could confide in.  It also passed a law depriving the \nBishops of their votes.  The King gave his assent to that bill, but \nwould not abandon the right of appointing the Lord Lieutenants, \nthough he said he was willing to appoint such as might be suggested \nto him by the Parliament.  When the Earl of Pembroke asked him \nwhether he would not give way on that question for a time, he said, \n\'By God! not for one hour!\' and upon this he and the Parliament \nwent to war.\n\nHis young daughter was betrothed to the Prince of Orange.  On \npretence of taking her to the country of her future husband, the \nQueen was already got safely away to Holland, there to pawn the \nCrown jewels for money to raise an army on the King\'s side.  The \nLord Admiral being sick, the House of Commons now named the Earl of \nWarwick to hold his place for a year.  The King named another \ngentleman; the House of Commons took its own way, and the Earl of \nWarwick became Lord Admiral without the King\'s consent.  The \nParliament sent orders down to Hull to have that magazine removed \nto London; the King went down to Hull to take it himself.  The \ncitizens would not admit him into the town, and the governor would \nnot admit him into the castle.  The Parliament resolved that \nwhatever the two Houses passed, and the King would not consent to, \nshould be called an ORDINANCE, and should be as much a law as if he \ndid consent to it.  The King protested against this, and gave \nnotice that these ordinances were not to be obeyed.  The King, \nattended by the majority of the House of Peers, and by many members \nof the House of Commons, established himself at York.  The \nChancellor went to him with the Great Seal, and the Parliament made \na new Great Seal.  The Queen sent over a ship full of arms and \nammunition, and the King issued letters to borrow money at high \ninterest.  The Parliament raised twenty regiments of foot and \nseventy-five troops of horse; and the people willingly aided them \nwith their money, plate, jewellery, and trinkets - the married \nwomen even with their wedding-rings.  Every member of Parliament \nwho could raise a troop or a regiment in his own part of the \ncountry, dressed it according to his taste and in his own colours, \nand commanded it.  Foremost among them all, OLIVER CROMWELL raised \na troop of horse - thoroughly in earnest and thoroughly well armed \n- who were, perhaps, the best soldiers that ever were seen.\n\nIn some of their proceedings, this famous Parliament passed the \nbounds of previous law and custom, yielded to and favoured riotous \nassemblages of the people, and acted tyrannically in imprisoning \nsome who differed from the popular leaders.  But again, you are \nalways to remember that the twelve years during which the King had \nhad his own wilful way, had gone before; and that nothing could \nmake the times what they might, could, would, or should have been, \nif those twelve years had never rolled away.\n\n\nTHIRD PART\n\n\nI SHALL not try to relate the particulars of the great civil war \nbetween King Charles the First and the Long Parliament, which \nlasted nearly four years, and a full account of which would fill \nmany large books.  It was a sad thing that Englishmen should once \nmore be fighting against Englishmen on English ground; but, it is \nsome consolation to know that on both sides there was great \nhumanity, forbearance, and honour.  The soldiers of the Parliament \nwere far more remarkable for these good qualities than the soldiers \nof the King (many of whom fought for mere pay without much caring \nfor the cause); but those of the nobility and gentry who were on \nthe King\'s side were so brave, and so faithful to him, that their \nconduct cannot but command our highest admiration.  Among them were \ngreat numbers of Catholics, who took the royal side because the \nQueen was so strongly of their persuasion.\n\nThe King might have distinguished some of these gallant spirits, if \nhe had been as generous a spirit himself, by giving them the \ncommand of his army.  Instead of that, however, true to his old \nhigh notions of royalty, he entrusted it to his two nephews, PRINCE \nRUPERT and PRINCE MAURICE, who were of royal blood and came over \nfrom abroad to help him.  It might have been better for him if they \nhad stayed away; since Prince Rupert was an impetuous, hot-headed \nfellow, whose only idea was to dash into battle at all times and \nseasons, and lay about him.\n\nThe general-in-chief of the Parliamentary army was the Earl of \nEssex, a gentleman of honour and an excellent soldier.  A little \nwhile before the war broke out, there had been some rioting at \nWestminster between certain officious law students and noisy \nsoldiers, and the shopkeepers and their apprentices, and the \ngeneral people in the streets.  At that time the King\'s friends \ncalled the crowd, Roundheads, because the apprentices wore short \nhair; the crowd, in return, called their opponents Cavaliers, \nmeaning that they were a blustering set, who pretended to be very \nmilitary.  These two words now began to be used to distinguish the \ntwo sides in the civil war.  The Royalists also called the \nParliamentary men Rebels and Rogues, while the Parliamentary men \ncalled THEM Malignants, and spoke of themselves as the Godly, the \nHonest, and so forth.\n\nThe war broke out at Portsmouth, where that double traitor Goring \nhad again gone over to the King and was besieged by the \nParliamentary troops.  Upon this, the King proclaimed the Earl of \nEssex and the officers serving under him, traitors, and called upon \nhis loyal subjects to meet him in arms at Nottingham on the twenty-\nfifth of August.  But his loyal subjects came about him in scanty \nnumbers, and it was a windy, gloomy day, and the Royal Standard got \nblown down, and the whole affair was very melancholy.  The chief \nengagements after this, took place in the vale of the Red Horse \nnear Banbury, at Brentford, at Devizes, at Chalgrave Field (where \nMr. Hampden was so sorely wounded while fighting at the head of his \nmen, that he died within a week), at Newbury (in which battle LORD \nFALKLAND, one of the best noblemen on the King\'s side, was killed), \nat Leicester, at Naseby, at Winchester, at Marston Moor near York, \nat Newcastle, and in many other parts of England and Scotland.  \nThese battles were attended with various successes.  At one time, \nthe King was victorious; at another time, the Parliament.  But \nalmost all the great and busy towns were against the King; and when \nit was considered necessary to fortify London, all ranks of people, \nfrom labouring men and women, up to lords and ladies, worked hard \ntogether with heartiness and good will.  The most distinguished \nleaders on the Parliamentary side were HAMPDEN, SIR THOMAS FAIRFAX, \nand, above all, OLIVER CROMWELL, and his son-in-law IRETON.\n\nDuring the whole of this war, the people, to whom it was very \nexpensive and irksome, and to whom it was made the more distressing \nby almost every family being divided - some of its members \nattaching themselves to one side and some to the other - were over \nand over again most anxious for peace.  So were some of the best \nmen in each cause.  Accordingly, treaties of peace were discussed \nbetween commissioners from the Parliament and the King; at York, at \nOxford (where the King held a little Parliament of his own), and at \nUxbridge.  But they came to nothing.  In all these negotiations, \nand in all his difficulties, the King showed himself at his best.  \nHe was courageous, cool, self-possessed, and clever; but, the old \ntaint of his character was always in him, and he was never for one \nsingle moment to be trusted.  Lord Clarendon, the historian, one of \nhis highest admirers, supposes that he had unhappily promised the \nQueen never to make peace without her consent, and that this must \noften be taken as his excuse.  He never kept his word from night to \nmorning.  He signed a cessation of hostilities with the blood-\nstained Irish rebels for a sum of money, and invited the Irish \nregiments over, to help him against the Parliament.  In the battle \nof Naseby, his cabinet was seized and was found to contain a \ncorrespondence with the Queen, in which he expressly told her that \nhe had deceived the Parliament - a mongrel Parliament, he called it \nnow, as an improvement on his old term of vipers - in pretending to \nrecognise it and to treat with it; and from which it further \nappeared that he had long been in secret treaty with the Duke of \nLorraine for a foreign army of ten thousand men.  Disappointed in \nthis, he sent a most devoted friend of his, the EARL OF GLAMORGAN, \nto Ireland, to conclude a secret treaty with the Catholic powers, \nto send him an Irish army of ten thousand men; in return for which \nhe was to bestow great favours on the Catholic religion.  And, when \nthis treaty was discovered in the carriage of a fighting Irish \nArchbishop who was killed in one of the many skirmishes of those \ndays, he basely denied and deserted his attached friend, the Earl, \non his being charged with high treason; and - even worse than this \n- had left blanks in the secret instructions he gave him with his \nown kingly hand, expressly that he might thus save himself.\n\nAt last, on the twenty-seventh day of April, one thousand six \nhundred and forty-six, the King found himself in the city of \nOxford, so surrounded by the Parliamentary army who were closing in \nupon him on all sides that he felt that if he would escape he must \ndelay no longer.  So, that night, having altered the cut of his \nhair and beard, he was dressed up as a servant and put upon a horse \nwith a cloak strapped behind him, and rode out of the town behind \none of his own faithful followers, with a clergyman of that country \nwho knew the road well, for a guide.  He rode towards London as far \nas Harrow, and then altered his plans and resolved, it would seem, \nto go to the Scottish camp.  The Scottish men had been invited over \nto help the Parliamentary army, and had a large force then in \nEngland.  The King was so desperately intriguing in everything he \ndid, that it is doubtful what he exactly meant by this step.  He \ntook it, anyhow, and delivered himself up to the EARL OF LEVEN, the \nScottish general-in-chief, who treated him as an honourable \nprisoner.  Negotiations between the Parliament on the one hand and \nthe Scottish authorities on the other, as to what should be done \nwith him, lasted until the following February.  Then, when the King \nhad refused to the Parliament the concession of that old militia \npoint for twenty years, and had refused to Scotland the recognition \nof its Solemn League and Covenant, Scotland got a handsome sum for \nits army and its help, and the King into the bargain.  He was \ntaken, by certain Parliamentary commissioners appointed to receive \nhim, to one of his own houses, called Holmby House, near Althorpe, \nin Northamptonshire.\n\nWhile the Civil War was still in progress, John Pym died, and was \nburied with great honour in Westminster Abbey - not with greater \nhonour than he deserved, for the liberties of Englishmen owe a \nmighty debt to Pym and Hampden.  The war was but newly over when \nthe Earl of Essex died, of an illness brought on by his having \noverheated himself in a stag hunt in Windsor Forest.  He, too, was \nburied in Westminster Abbey, with great state.  I wish it were not \nnecessary to add that Archbishop Laud died upon the scaffold when \nthe war was not yet done.  His trial lasted in all nearly a year, \nand, it being doubtful even then whether the charges brought \nagainst him amounted to treason, the odious old contrivance of the \nworst kings was resorted to, and a bill of attainder was brought in \nagainst him.  He was a violently prejudiced and mischievous person; \nhad had strong ear-cropping and nose-splitting propensities, as you \nknow; and had done a world of harm.  But he died peaceably, and \nlike a brave old man.\n\n\nFOURTH PART\n\n\nWHEN the Parliament had got the King into their hands, they became \nvery anxious to get rid of their army, in which Oliver Cromwell had \nbegun to acquire great power; not only because of his courage and \nhigh abilities, but because he professed to be very sincere in the \nScottish sort of Puritan religion that was then exceedingly popular \namong the soldiers.  They were as much opposed to the Bishops as to \nthe Pope himself; and the very privates, drummers, and trumpeters, \nhad such an inconvenient habit of starting up and preaching long-\nwinded discourses, that I would not have belonged to that army on \nany account.\n\nSo, the Parliament, being far from sure but that the army might \nbegin to preach and fight against them now it had nothing else to \ndo, proposed to disband the greater part of it, to send another \npart to serve in Ireland against the rebels, and to keep only a \nsmall force in England.  But, the army would not consent to be \nbroken up, except upon its own conditions; and, when the Parliament \nshowed an intention of compelling it, it acted for itself in an \nunexpected manner.  A certain cornet, of the name of JOICE, arrived \nat Holmby House one night, attended by four hundred horsemen, went \ninto the King\'s room with his hat in one hand and a pistol in the \nother, and told the King that he had come to take him away.  The \nKing was willing enough to go, and only stipulated that he should \nbe publicly required to do so next morning.  Next morning, \naccordingly, he appeared on the top of the steps of the house, and \nasked Comet Joice before his men and the guard set there by the \nParliament, what authority he had for taking him away?  To this \nCornet Joice replied, \'The authority of the army.\'  \'Have you a \nwritten commission?\' said the King.  Joice, pointing to his four \nhundred men on horseback, replied, \'That is my commission.\'  \n\'Well,\' said the King, smiling, as if he were pleased, \'I never \nbefore read such a commission; but it is written in fair and \nlegible characters.  This is a company of as handsome proper \ngentlemen as I have seen a long while.\'  He was asked where he \nwould like to live, and he said at Newmarket.  So, to Newmarket he \nand Cornet Joice and the four hundred horsemen rode; the King \nremarking, in the same smiling way, that he could ride as far at a \nspell as Cornet Joice, or any man there.\n\nThe King quite believed, I think, that the army were his friends.  \nHe said as much to Fairfax when that general, Oliver Cromwell, and \nIreton, went to persuade him to return to the custody of the \nParliament.  He preferred to remain as he was, and resolved to \nremain as he was.  And when the army moved nearer and nearer London \nto frighten the Parliament into yielding to their demands, they \ntook the King with them.  It was a deplorable thing that England \nshould be at the mercy of a great body of soldiers with arms in \ntheir hands; but the King certainly favoured them at this important \ntime of his life, as compared with the more lawful power that tried \nto control him.  It must be added, however, that they treated him, \nas yet, more respectfully and kindly than the Parliament had done.  \nThey allowed him to be attended by his own servants, to be \nsplendidly entertained at various houses, and to see his children - \nat Cavesham House, near Reading - for two days.  Whereas, the \nParliament had been rather hard with him, and had only allowed him \nto ride out and play at bowls.\n\nIt is much to be believed that if the King could have been trusted, \neven at this time, he might have been saved.  Even Oliver Cromwell \nexpressly said that he did believe that no man could enjoy his \npossessions in peace, unless the King had his rights.  He was not \nunfriendly towards the King; he had been present when he received \nhis children, and had been much affected by the pitiable nature of \nthe scene; he saw the King often; he frequently walked and talked \nwith him in the long galleries and pleasant gardens of the Palace \nat Hampton Court, whither he was now removed; and in all this \nrisked something of his influence with the army.  But, the King was \nin secret hopes of help from the Scottish people; and the moment he \nwas encouraged to join them he began to be cool to his new friends, \nthe army, and to tell the officers that they could not possibly do \nwithout him.  At the very time, too, when he was promising to make \nCromwell and Ireton noblemen, if they would help him up to his old \nheight, he was writing to the Queen that he meant to hang them.  \nThey both afterwards declared that they had been privately informed \nthat such a letter would be found, on a certain evening, sewed up \nin a saddle which would be taken to the Blue Boar in Holborn to be \nsent to Dover; and that they went there, disguised as common \nsoldiers, and sat drinking in the inn-yard until a man came with \nthe saddle, which they ripped up with their knives, and therein \nfound the letter.  I see little reason to doubt the story.  It is \ncertain that Oliver Cromwell told one of the King\'s most faithful \nfollowers that the King could not be trusted, and that he would not \nbe answerable if anything amiss were to happen to him.  Still, even \nafter that, he kept a promise he had made to the King, by letting \nhim know that there was a plot with a certain portion of the army \nto seize him.  I believe that, in fact, he sincerely wanted the \nKing to escape abroad, and so to be got rid of without more trouble \nor danger.  That Oliver himself had work enough with the army is \npretty plain; for some of the troops were so mutinous against him, \nand against those who acted with him at this time, that he found it \nnecessary to have one man shot at the head of his regiment to \noverawe the rest.\n\nThe King, when he received Oliver\'s warning, made his escape from \nHampton Court; after some indecision and uncertainty, he went to \nCarisbrooke Castle in the Isle of Wight.  At first, he was pretty \nfree there; but, even there, he carried on a pretended treaty with \nthe Parliament, while he was really treating with commissioners \nfrom Scotland to send an army into England to take his part.  When \nhe broke off this treaty with the Parliament (having settled with \nScotland) and was treated as a prisoner, his treatment was not \nchanged too soon, for he had plotted to escape that very night to a \nship sent by the Queen, which was lying off the island.\n\nHe was doomed to be disappointed in his hopes from Scotland.  The \nagreement he had made with the Scottish Commissioners was not \nfavourable enough to the religion of that country to please the \nScottish clergy; and they preached against it.  The consequence \nwas, that the army raised in Scotland and sent over, was too small \nto do much; and that, although it was helped by a rising of the \nRoyalists in England and by good soldiers from Ireland, it could \nmake no head against the Parliamentary army under such men as \nCromwell and Fairfax.  The King\'s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, \ncame over from Holland with nineteen ships (a part of the English \nfleet having gone over to him) to help his father; but nothing came \nof his voyage, and he was fain to return.  The most remarkable \nevent of this second civil war was the cruel execution by the \nParliamentary General, of SIR CHARLES LUCAS and SIR GEORGE LISLE, \ntwo grand Royalist generals, who had bravely defended Colchester \nunder every disadvantage of famine and distress for nearly three \nmonths.  When Sir Charles Lucas was shot, Sir George Lisle kissed \nhis body, and said to the soldiers who were to shoot him, \'Come \nnearer, and make sure of me.\'  \'I warrant you, Sir George,\' said \none of the soldiers, \'we shall hit you.\'  \'AY?\' he returned with a \nsmile, \'but I have been nearer to you, my friends, many a time, and \nyou have missed me.\'\n\nThe Parliament, after being fearfully bullied by the army - who \ndemanded to have seven members whom they disliked given up to them \n- had voted that they would have nothing more to do with the King.  \nOn the conclusion, however, of this second civil war (which did not \nlast more than six months), they appointed commissioners to treat \nwith him.  The King, then so far released again as to be allowed to \nlive in a private house at Newport in the Isle of Wight, managed \nhis own part of the negotiation with a sense that was admired by \nall who saw him, and gave up, in the end, all that was asked of him \n- even yielding (which he had steadily refused, so far) to the \ntemporary abolition of the bishops, and the transfer of their \nchurch land to the Crown.  Still, with his old fatal vice upon him, \nwhen his best friends joined the commissioners in beseeching him to \nyield all those points as the only means of saving himself from the \narmy, he was plotting to escape from the island; he was holding \ncorrespondence with his friends and the Catholics in Ireland, \nthough declaring that he was not; and he was writing, with his own \nhand, that in what he yielded he meant nothing but to get time to \nescape.\n\nMatters were at this pass when the army, resolved to defy the \nParliament, marched up to London.  The Parliament, not afraid of \nthem now, and boldly led by Hollis, voted that the King\'s \nconcessions were sufficient ground for settling the peace of the \nkingdom.  Upon that, COLONEL RICH and COLONEL PRIDE went down to \nthe House of Commons with a regiment of horse soldiers and a \nregiment of foot; and Colonel Pride, standing in the lobby with a \nlist of the members who were obnoxious to the army in his hand, had \nthem pointed out to him as they came through, and took them all \ninto custody.  This proceeding was afterwards called by the people, \nfor a joke, PRIDE\'S PURGE.  Cromwell was in the North, at the head \nof his men, at the time, but when he came home, approved of what \nhad been done.\n\nWhat with imprisoning some members and causing others to stay away, \nthe army had now reduced the House of Commons to some fifty or so.  \nThese soon voted that it was treason in a king to make war against \nhis parliament and his people, and sent an ordinance up to the \nHouse of Lords for the King\'s being tried as a traitor.  The House \nof Lords, then sixteen in number, to a man rejected it.  Thereupon, \nthe Commons made an ordinance of their own, that they were the \nsupreme government of the country, and would bring the King to \ntrial.\n\nThe King had been taken for security to a place called Hurst \nCastle:  a lonely house on a rock in the sea, connected with the \ncoast of Hampshire by a rough road two miles long at low water.  \nThence, he was ordered to be removed to Windsor; thence, after \nbeing but rudely used there, and having none but soldiers to wait \nupon him at table, he was brought up to St. James\'s Palace in \nLondon, and told that his trial was appointed for next day.\n\nOn Saturday, the twentieth of January, one thousand six hundred and \nforty-nine, this memorable trial began.  The House of Commons had \nsettled that one hundred and thirty-five persons should form the \nCourt, and these were taken from the House itself, from among the \nofficers of the army, and from among the lawyers and citizens.  \nJOHN BRADSHAW, serjeant-at-law, was appointed president.  The place \nwas Westminster Hall.  At the upper end, in a red velvet chair, sat \nthe president, with his hat (lined with plates of iron for his \nprotection) on his head.  The rest of the Court sat on side \nbenches, also wearing their hats.  The King\'s seat was covered with \nvelvet, like that of the president, and was opposite to it.  He was \nbrought from St. James\'s to Whitehall, and from Whitehall he came \nby water to his trial.\n\nWhen he came in, he looked round very steadily on the Court, and on \nthe great number of spectators, and then sat down:  presently he \ngot up and looked round again.  On the indictment \'against Charles \nStuart, for high treason,\' being read, he smiled several times, and \nhe denied the authority of the Court, saying that there could be no \nparliament without a House of Lords, and that he saw no House of \nLords there.  Also, that the King ought to be there, and that he \nsaw no King in the King\'s right place.  Bradshaw replied, that the \nCourt was satisfied with its authority, and that its authority was \nGod\'s authority and the kingdom\'s.  He then adjourned the Court to \nthe following Monday.  On that day, the trial was resumed, and went \non all the week.  When the Saturday came, as the King passed \nforward to his place in the Hall, some soldiers and others cried \nfor \'justice!\' and execution on him.  That day, too, Bradshaw, like \nan angry Sultan, wore a red robe, instead of the black robe he had \nworn before.  The King was sentenced to death that day.  As he went \nout, one solitary soldier said, \'God bless you, Sir!\'  For this, \nhis officer struck him.  The King said he thought the punishment \nexceeded the offence.  The silver head of his walking-stick had \nfallen off while he leaned upon it, at one time of the trial.  The \naccident seemed to disturb him, as if he thought it ominous of the \nfalling of his own head; and he admitted as much, now it was all \nover.\n\nBeing taken back to Whitehall, he sent to the House of Commons, \nsaying that as the time of his execution might be nigh, he wished \nhe might be allowed to see his darling children.  It was granted.  \nOn the Monday he was taken back to St. James\'s; and his two \nchildren then in England, the PRINCESS ELIZABETH thirteen years \nold, and the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER nine years old, were brought to \ntake leave of him, from Sion House, near Brentford.  It was a sad \nand touching scene, when he kissed and fondled those poor children, \nand made a little present of two diamond seals to the Princess, and \ngave them tender messages to their mother (who little deserved \nthem, for she had a lover of her own whom she married soon \nafterwards), and told them that he died \'for the laws and liberties \nof the land.\'  I am bound to say that I don\'t think he did, but I \ndare say he believed so.\n\nThere were ambassadors from Holland that day, to intercede for the \nunhappy King, whom you and I both wish the Parliament had spared; \nbut they got no answer.  The Scottish Commissioners interceded too; \nso did the Prince of Wales, by a letter in which he offered as the \nnext heir to the throne, to accept any conditions from the \nParliament; so did the Queen, by letter likewise.\n\nNotwithstanding all, the warrant for the execution was this day \nsigned.  There is a story that as Oliver Cromwell went to the table \nwith the pen in his hand to put his signature to it, he drew his \npen across the face of one of the commissioners, who was standing \nnear, and marked it with ink.  That commissioner had not signed his \nown name yet, and the story adds that when he came to do it he \nmarked Cromwell\'s face with ink in the same way.\n\nThe King slept well, untroubled by the knowledge that it was his \nlast night on earth, and rose on the thirtieth of January, two \nhours before day, and dressed himself carefully.  He put on two \nshirts lest he should tremble with the cold, and had his hair very \ncarefully combed.  The warrant had been directed to three officers \nof the army, COLONEL HACKER, COLONEL HUNKS, and COLONEL PHAYER.  At \nten o\'clock, the first of these came to the door and said it was \ntime to go to Whitehall.  The King, who had always been a quick \nwalker, walked at his usual speed through the Park, and called out \nto the guard, with his accustomed voice of command, \'March on \napace!\'  When he came to Whitehall, he was taken to his own \nbedroom, where a breakfast was set forth.  As he had taken the \nSacrament, he would eat nothing more; but, at about the time when \nthe church bells struck twelve at noon (for he had to wait, through \nthe scaffold not being ready), he took the advice of the good \nBISHOP JUXON who was with him, and ate a little bread and drank a \nglass of claret.  Soon after he had taken this refreshment, Colonel \nHacker came to the chamber with the warrant in his hand, and called \nfor Charles Stuart.\n\nAnd then, through the long gallery of Whitehall Palace, which he \nhad often seen light and gay and merry and crowded, in very \ndifferent times, the fallen King passed along, until he came to the \ncentre window of the Banqueting House, through which he emerged \nupon the scaffold, which was hung with black.  He looked at the two \nexecutioners, who were dressed in black and masked; he looked at \nthe troops of soldiers on horseback and on foot, and all looked up \nat him in silence; he looked at the vast array of spectators, \nfilling up the view beyond, and turning all their faces upon him; \nhe looked at his old Palace of St. James\'s; and he looked at the \nblock.  He seemed a little troubled to find that it was so low, and \nasked, \'if there were no place higher?\'  Then, to those upon the \nscaffold, he said, \'that it was the Parliament who had begun the \nwar, and not he; but he hoped they might be guiltless too, as ill \ninstruments had gone between them.  In one respect,\' he said, \'he \nsuffered justly; and that was because he had permitted an unjust \nsentence to be executed on another.\'  In this he referred to the \nEarl of Strafford.\n\nHe was not at all afraid to die; but he was anxious to die easily.  \nWhen some one touched the axe while he was speaking, he broke off \nand called out, \'Take heed of the axe! take heed of the axe!\'  He \nalso said to Colonel Hacker, \'Take care that they do not put me to \npain.\'  He told the executioner, \'I shall say but very short \nprayers, and then thrust out my hands\' - as the sign to strike.\n\nHe put his hair up, under a white satin cap which the bishop had \ncarried, and said, \'I have a good cause and a gracious God on my \nside.\'  The bishop told him that he had but one stage more to \ntravel in this weary world, and that, though it was a turbulent and \ntroublesome stage, it was a short one, and would carry him a great \nway - all the way from earth to Heaven.  The King\'s last word, as \nhe gave his cloak and the George - the decoration from his breast - \nto the bishop, was, \'Remember!\'  He then kneeled down, laid his \nhead on the block, spread out his hands, and was instantly killed.  \nOne universal groan broke from the crowd; and the soldiers, who had \nsat on their horses and stood in their ranks immovable as statues, \nwere of a sudden all in motion, clearing the streets.\n\nThus, in the forty-ninth year of his age, falling at the same time \nof his career as Strafford had fallen in his, perished Charles the \nFirst.  With all my sorrow for him, I cannot agree with him that he \ndied \'the martyr of the people;\' for the people had been martyrs to \nhim, and to his ideas of a King\'s rights, long before.  Indeed, I \nam afraid that he was but a bad judge of martyrs; for he had called \nthat infamous Duke of Buckingham \'the Martyr of his Sovereign.\'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV - ENGLAND UNDER OLIVER CROMWELL\n\n\n\nBEFORE sunset on the memorable day on which King Charles the First \nwas executed, the House of Commons passed an act declaring it \ntreason in any one to proclaim the Prince of Wales - or anybody \nelse - King of England.  Soon afterwards, it declared that the \nHouse of Lords was useless and dangerous, and ought to be \nabolished; and directed that the late King\'s statue should be taken \ndown from the Royal Exchange in the City and other public places.  \nHaving laid hold of some famous Royalists who had escaped from \nprison, and having beheaded the DUKE OF HAMILTON, LORD HOLLAND, and \nLORD CAPEL, in Palace Yard (all of whom died very courageously), \nthey then appointed a Council of State to govern the country.  It \nconsisted of forty-one members, of whom five were peers.  Bradshaw \nwas made president.  The House of Commons also re-admitted members \nwho had opposed the King\'s death, and made up its numbers to about \na hundred and fifty.\n\nBut, it still had an army of more than forty thousand men to deal \nwith, and a very hard task it was to manage them.  Before the \nKing\'s execution, the army had appointed some of its officers to \nremonstrate between them and the Parliament; and now the common \nsoldiers began to take that office upon themselves.  The regiments \nunder orders for Ireland mutinied; one troop of horse in the city \nof London seized their own flag, and refused to obey orders.  For \nthis, the ringleader was shot:  which did not mend the matter, for, \nboth his comrades and the people made a public funeral for him, and \naccompanied the body to the grave with sound of trumpets and with a \ngloomy procession of persons carrying bundles of rosemary steeped \nin blood.  Oliver was the only man to deal with such difficulties \nas these, and he soon cut them short by bursting at midnight into \nthe town of Burford, near Salisbury, where the mutineers were \nsheltered, taking four hundred of them prisoners, and shooting a \nnumber of them by sentence of court-martial.  The soldiers soon \nfound, as all men did, that Oliver was not a man to be trifled \nwith.  And there was an end of the mutiny.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament did not know Oliver yet; so, on hearing of \nthe King\'s execution, it proclaimed the Prince of Wales King \nCharles the Second, on condition of his respecting the Solemn \nLeague and Covenant.  Charles was abroad at that time, and so was \nMontrose, from whose help he had hopes enough to keep him holding \non and off with commissioners from Scotland, just as his father \nmight have done.  These hopes were soon at an end; for, Montrose, \nhaving raised a few hundred exiles in Germany, and landed with them \nin Scotland, found that the people there, instead of joining him, \ndeserted the country at his approach.  He was soon taken prisoner \nand carried to Edinburgh.  There he was received with every \npossible insult, and carried to prison in a cart, his officers \ngoing two and two before him.  He was sentenced by the Parliament \nto be hanged on a gallows thirty feet high, to have his head set on \na spike in Edinburgh, and his limbs distributed in other places, \naccording to the old barbarous manner.  He said he had always acted \nunder the Royal orders, and only wished he had limbs enough to be \ndistributed through Christendom, that it might be the more widely \nknown how loyal he had been.  He went to the scaffold in a bright \nand brilliant dress, and made a bold end at thirty-eight years of \nage.  The breath was scarcely out of his body when Charles \nabandoned his memory, and denied that he had ever given him orders \nto rise in his behalf.  O the family failing was strong in that \nCharles then!\n\nOliver had been appointed by the Parliament to command the army in \nIreland, where he took a terrible vengeance for the sanguinary \nrebellion, and made tremendous havoc, particularly in the siege of \nDrogheda, where no quarter was given, and where he found at least a \nthousand of the inhabitants shut up together in the great church:  \nevery one of whom was killed by his soldiers, usually known as \nOLIVER\'S IRONSIDES.  There were numbers of friars and priests among \nthem, and Oliver gruffly wrote home in his despatch that these were \n\'knocked on the head\' like the rest.\n\nBut, Charles having got over to Scotland where the men of the \nSolemn League and Covenant led him a prodigiously dull life and \nmade him very weary with long sermons and grim Sundays, the \nParliament called the redoubtable Oliver home to knock the Scottish \nmen on the head for setting up that Prince.  Oliver left his son-\nin-law, Ireton, as general in Ireland in his stead (he died there \nafterwards), and he imitated the example of his father-in-law with \nsuch good will that he brought the country to subjection, and laid \nit at the feet of the Parliament.  In the end, they passed an act \nfor the settlement of Ireland, generally pardoning all the common \npeople, but exempting from this grace such of the wealthier sort as \nhad been concerned in the rebellion, or in any killing of \nProtestants, or who refused to lay down their arms.  Great numbers \nof Irish were got out of the country to serve under Catholic powers \nabroad, and a quantity of land was declared to have been forfeited \nby past offences, and was given to people who had lent money to the \nParliament early in the war.  These were sweeping measures; but, if \nOliver Cromwell had had his own way fully, and had stayed in \nIreland, he would have done more yet.\n\nHowever, as I have said, the Parliament wanted Oliver for Scotland; \nso, home Oliver came, and was made Commander of all the Forces of \nthe Commonwealth of England, and in three days away he went with \nsixteen thousand soldiers to fight the Scottish men.  Now, the \nScottish men, being then - as you will generally find them now - \nmighty cautious, reflected that the troops they had were not used \nto war like the Ironsides, and would be beaten in an open fight.  \nTherefore they said, \'If we live quiet in our trenches in Edinburgh \nhere, and if all the farmers come into the town and desert the \ncountry, the Ironsides will be driven out by iron hunger and be \nforced to go away.\'  This was, no doubt, the wisest plan; but as \nthe Scottish clergy WOULD interfere with what they knew nothing \nabout, and would perpetually preach long sermons exhorting the \nsoldiers to come out and fight, the soldiers got it in their heads \nthat they absolutely must come out and fight.  Accordingly, in an \nevil hour for themselves, they came out of their safe position.  \nOliver fell upon them instantly, and killed three thousand, and \ntook ten thousand prisoners.\n\nTo gratify the Scottish Parliament, and preserve their favour, \nCharles had signed a declaration they laid before him, reproaching \nthe memory of his father and mother, and representing himself as a \nmost religious Prince, to whom the Solemn League and Covenant was \nas dear as life.  He meant no sort of truth in this, and soon \nafterwards galloped away on horseback to join some tiresome \nHighland friends, who were always flourishing dirks and \nbroadswords.  He was overtaken and induced to return; but this \nattempt, which was called \'The Start,\' did him just so much \nservice, that they did not preach quite such long sermons at him \nafterwards as they had done before.\n\nOn the first of January, one thousand six hundred and fifty-one, \nthe Scottish people crowned him at Scone.  He immediately took the \nchief command of an army of twenty thousand men, and marched to \nStirling.  His hopes were heightened, I dare say, by the \nredoubtable Oliver being ill of an ague; but Oliver scrambled out \nof bed in no time, and went to work with such energy that he got \nbehind the Royalist army and cut it off from all communication with \nScotland.  There was nothing for it then, but to go on to England; \nso it went on as far as Worcester, where the mayor and some of the \ngentry proclaimed King Charles the Second straightway.  His \nproclamation, however, was of little use to him, for very few \nRoyalists appeared; and, on the very same day, two people were \npublicly beheaded on Tower Hill for espousing his cause.  Up came \nOliver to Worcester too, at double quick speed, and he and his \nIronsides so laid about them in the great battle which was fought \nthere, that they completely beat the Scottish men, and destroyed \nthe Royalist army; though the Scottish men fought so gallantly that \nit took five hours to do.\n\nThe escape of Charles after this battle of Worcester did him good \nservice long afterwards, for it induced many of the generous \nEnglish people to take a romantic interest in him, and to think \nmuch better of him than he ever deserved.  He fled in the night, \nwith not more than sixty followers, to the house of a Catholic lady \nin Staffordshire.  There, for his greater safety, the whole sixty \nleft him.  He cropped his hair, stained his face and hands brown as \nif they were sunburnt, put on the clothes of a labouring \ncountryman, and went out in the morning with his axe in his hand, \naccompanied by four wood-cutters who were brothers, and another man \nwho was their brother-in-law.  These good fellows made a bed for \nhim under a tree, as the weather was very bad; and the wife of one \nof them brought him food to eat; and the old mother of the four \nbrothers came and fell down on her knees before him in the wood, \nand thanked God that her sons were engaged in saving his life.  At \nnight, he came out of the forest and went on to another house which \nwas near the river Severn, with the intention of passing into \nWales; but the place swarmed with soldiers, and the bridges were \nguarded, and all the boats were made fast.  So, after lying in a \nhayloft covered over with hay, for some time, he came out of his \nplace, attended by COLONEL CARELESS, a Catholic gentleman who had \nmet him there, and with whom he lay hid, all next day, up in the \nshady branches of a fine old oak.  It was lucky for the King that \nit was September-time, and that the leaves had not begun to fall, \nsince he and the Colonel, perched up in this tree, could catch \nglimpses of the soldiers riding about below, and could hear the \ncrash in the wood as they went about beating the boughs.\n\nAfter this, he walked and walked until his feet were all blistered; \nand, having been concealed all one day in a house which was \nsearched by the troopers while he was there, went with LORD WILMOT, \nanother of his good friends, to a place called Bentley, where one \nMISS LANE, a Protestant lady, had obtained a pass to be allowed to \nride through the guards to see a relation of hers near Bristol.  \nDisguised as a servant, he rode in the saddle before this young \nlady to the house of SIR JOHN WINTER, while Lord Wilmot rode there \nboldly, like a plain country gentleman, with dogs at his heels.  It \nhappened that Sir John Winter\'s butler had been servant in Richmond \nPalace, and knew Charles the moment he set eyes upon him; but, the \nbutler was faithful and kept the secret.  As no ship could be found \nto carry him abroad, it was planned that he should go - still \ntravelling with Miss Lane as her servant - to another house, at \nTrent near Sherborne in Dorsetshire; and then Miss Lane and her \ncousin, MR. LASCELLES, who had gone on horseback beside her all the \nway, went home.  I hope Miss Lane was going to marry that cousin, \nfor I am sure she must have been a brave, kind girl.  If I had been \nthat cousin, I should certainly have loved Miss Lane.\n\nWhen Charles, lonely for the loss of Miss Lane, was safe at Trent, \na ship was hired at Lyme, the master of which engaged to take two \ngentlemen to France.  In the evening of the same day, the King - \nnow riding as servant before another young lady - set off for a \npublic-house at a place called Charmouth, where the captain of the \nvessel was to take him on board.  But, the captain\'s wife, being \nafraid of her husband getting into trouble, locked him up and would \nnot let him sail.  Then they went away to Bridport; and, coming to \nthe inn there, found the stable-yard full of soldiers who were on \nthe look-out for Charles, and who talked about him while they \ndrank.  He had such presence of mind, that he led the horses of his \nparty through the yard as any other servant might have done, and \nsaid, \'Come out of the way, you soldiers; let us have room to pass \nhere!\'  As he went along, he met a half-tipsy ostler, who rubbed \nhis eyes and said to him, \'Why, I was formerly servant to Mr. \nPotter at Exeter, and surely I have sometimes seen you there, young \nman?\'  He certainly had, for Charles had lodged there.  His ready \nanswer was, \'Ah, I did live with him once; but I have no time to \ntalk now.  We\'ll have a pot of beer together when I come back.\'\n\nFrom this dangerous place he returned to Trent, and lay there \nconcealed several days.  Then he escaped to Heale, near Salisbury; \nwhere, in the house of a widow lady, he was hidden five days, until \nthe master of a collier lying off Shoreham in Sussex, undertook to \nconvey a \'gentleman\' to France.  On the night of the fifteenth of \nOctober, accompanied by two colonels and a merchant, the King rode \nto Brighton, then a little fishing village, to give the captain of \nthe ship a supper before going on board; but, so many people knew \nhim, that this captain knew him too, and not only he, but the \nlandlord and landlady also.  Before he went away, the landlord came \nbehind his chair, kissed his hand, and said he hoped to live to be \na lord and to see his wife a lady; at which Charles laughed.  They \nhad had a good supper by this time, and plenty of smoking and \ndrinking, at which the King was a first-rate hand; so, the captain \nassured him that he would stand by him, and he did.  It was agreed \nthat the captain should pretend to sail to Deal, and that Charles \nshould address the sailors and say he was a gentleman in debt who \nwas running away from his creditors, and that he hoped they would \njoin him in persuading the captain to put him ashore in France.  As \nthe King acted his part very well indeed, and gave the sailors \ntwenty shillings to drink, they begged the captain to do what such \na worthy gentleman asked.  He pretended to yield to their \nentreaties, and the King got safe to Normandy.\n\nIreland being now subdued, and Scotland kept quiet by plenty of \nforts and soldiers put there by Oliver, the Parliament would have \ngone on quietly enough, as far as fighting with any foreign enemy \nwent, but for getting into trouble with the Dutch, who in the \nspring of the year one thousand six hundred and fifty-one sent a \nfleet into the Downs under their ADMIRAL VAN TROMP, to call upon \nthe bold English ADMIRAL BLAKE (who was there with half as many \nships as the Dutch) to strike his flag.  Blake fired a raging \nbroadside instead, and beat off Van Tromp; who, in the autumn, came \nback again with seventy ships, and challenged the bold Blake - who \nstill was only half as strong - to fight him.  Blake fought him all \nday; but, finding that the Dutch were too many for him, got quietly \noff at night.  What does Van Tromp upon this, but goes cruising and \nboasting about the Channel, between the North Foreland and the Isle \nof Wight, with a great Dutch broom tied to his masthead, as a sign \nthat he could and would sweep the English of the sea!  Within three \nmonths, Blake lowered his tone though, and his broom too; for, he \nand two other bold commanders, DEAN and MONK, fought him three \nwhole days, took twenty-three of his ships, shivered his broom to \npieces, and settled his business.\n\nThings were no sooner quiet again, than the army began to complain \nto the Parliament that they were not governing the nation properly, \nand to hint that they thought they could do it better themselves.  \nOliver, who had now made up his mind to be the head of the state, \nor nothing at all, supported them in this, and called a meeting of \nofficers and his own Parliamentary friends, at his lodgings in \nWhitehall, to consider the best way of getting rid of the \nParliament.  It had now lasted just as many years as the King\'s \nunbridled power had lasted, before it came into existence.  The end \nof the deliberation was, that Oliver went down to the House in his \nusual plain black dress, with his usual grey worsted stockings, but \nwith an unusual party of soldiers behind him.  These last he left \nin the lobby, and then went in and sat down.  Presently he got up, \nmade the Parliament a speech, told them that the Lord had done with \nthem, stamped his foot and said, \'You are no Parliament.  Bring \nthem in!  Bring them in!\'  At this signal the door flew open, and \nthe soldiers appeared.  \'This is not honest,\' said Sir Harry Vane, \none of the members.  \'Sir Harry Vane!\' cried Cromwell; \'O, Sir \nHarry Vane!  The Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane!\'  Then he \npointed out members one by one, and said this man was a drunkard, \nand that man a dissipated fellow, and that man a liar, and so on.  \nThen he caused the Speaker to be walked out of his chair, told the \nguard to clear the House, called the mace upon the table - which is \na sign that the House is sitting - \'a fool\'s bauble,\' and said, \n\'here, carry it away!\'  Being obeyed in all these orders, he \nquietly locked the door, put the key in his pocket, walked back to \nWhitehall again, and told his friends, who were still assembled \nthere, what he had done.\n\nThey formed a new Council of State after this extraordinary \nproceeding, and got a new Parliament together in their own way:  \nwhich Oliver himself opened in a sort of sermon, and which he said \nwas the beginning of a perfect heaven upon earth.  In this \nParliament there sat a well-known leather-seller, who had taken the \nsingular name of Praise God Barebones, and from whom it was called, \nfor a joke, Barebones\'s Parliament, though its general name was the \nLittle Parliament.  As it soon appeared that it was not going to \nput Oliver in the first place, it turned out to be not at all like \nthe beginning of heaven upon earth, and Oliver said it really was \nnot to be borne with.  So he cleared off that Parliament in much \nthe same way as he had disposed of the other; and then the council \nof officers decided that he must be made the supreme authority of \nthe kingdom, under the title of the Lord Protector of the \nCommonwealth.\n\nSo, on the sixteenth of December, one thousand six hundred and \nfifty-three, a great procession was formed at Oliver\'s door, and he \ncame out in a black velvet suit and a big pair of boots, and got \ninto his coach and went down to Westminster, attended by the \njudges, and the lord mayor, and the aldermen, and all the other \ngreat and wonderful personages of the country.  There, in the Court \nof Chancery, he publicly accepted the office of Lord Protector.  \nThen he was sworn, and the City sword was handed to him, and the \nseal was handed to him, and all the other things were handed to him \nwhich are usually handed to Kings and Queens on state occasions.  \nWhen Oliver had handed them all back, he was quite made and \ncompletely finished off as Lord Protector; and several of the \nIronsides preached about it at great length, all the evening.\n\n\nSECOND PART\n\n\nOLIVER CROMWELL - whom the people long called OLD NOLL - in \naccepting the office of Protector, had bound himself by a certain \npaper which was handed to him, called \'the Instrument,\' to summon a \nParliament, consisting of between four and five hundred members, in \nthe election of which neither the Royalists nor the Catholics were \nto have any share.  He had also pledged himself that this \nParliament should not be dissolved without its own consent until it \nhad sat five months.\n\nWhen this Parliament met, Oliver made a speech to them of three \nhours long, very wisely advising them what to do for the credit and \nhappiness of the country.  To keep down the more violent members, \nhe required them to sign a recognition of what they were forbidden \nby \'the Instrument\' to do; which was, chiefly, to take the power \nfrom one single person at the head of the state or to command the \narmy.  Then he dismissed them to go to work.  With his usual vigour \nand resolution he went to work himself with some frantic preachers \n- who were rather overdoing their sermons in calling him a villain \nand a tyrant - by shutting up their chapels, and sending a few of \nthem off to prison.\n\nThere was not at that time, in England or anywhere else, a man so \nable to govern the country as Oliver Cromwell.  Although he ruled \nwith a strong hand, and levied a very heavy tax on the Royalists \n(but not until they had plotted against his life), he ruled wisely, \nand as the times required.  He caused England to be so respected \nabroad, that I wish some lords and gentlemen who have governed it \nunder kings and queens in later days would have taken a leaf out of \nOliver Cromwell\'s book.  He sent bold Admiral Blake to the \nMediterranean Sea, to make the Duke of Tuscany pay sixty thousand \npounds for injuries he had done to British subjects, and spoliation \nhe had committed on English merchants.  He further despatched him \nand his fleet to Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, to have every English \nship and every English man delivered up to him that had been taken \nby pirates in those parts.  All this was gloriously done; and it \nbegan to be thoroughly well known, all over the world, that England \nwas governed by a man in earnest, who would not allow the English \nname to be insulted or slighted anywhere.\n\nThese were not all his foreign triumphs.  He sent a fleet to sea \nagainst the Dutch; and the two powers, each with one hundred ships \nupon its side, met in the English Channel off the North Foreland, \nwhere the fight lasted all day long.  Dean was killed in this \nfight; but Monk, who commanded in the same ship with him, threw his \ncloak over his body, that the sailors might not know of his death, \nand be disheartened.  Nor were they.  The English broadsides so \nexceedingly astonished the Dutch that they sheered off at last, \nthough the redoubtable Van Tromp fired upon them with his own guns \nfor deserting their flag.  Soon afterwards, the two fleets engaged \nagain, off the coast of Holland.  There, the valiant Van Tromp was \nshot through the heart, and the Dutch gave in, and peace was made.\n\nFurther than this, Oliver resolved not to bear the domineering and \nbigoted conduct of Spain, which country not only claimed a right to \nall the gold and silver that could be found in South America, and \ntreated the ships of all other countries who visited those regions, \nas pirates, but put English subjects into the horrible Spanish \nprisons of the Inquisition.  So, Oliver told the Spanish ambassador \nthat English ships must be free to go wherever they would, and that \nEnglish merchants must not be thrown into those same dungeons, no, \nnot for the pleasure of all the priests in Spain.  To this, the \nSpanish ambassador replied that the gold and silver country, and \nthe Holy Inquisition, were his King\'s two eyes, neither of which he \ncould submit to have put out.  Very well, said Oliver, then he was \nafraid he (Oliver) must damage those two eyes directly.\n\nSo, another fleet was despatched under two commanders, PENN and \nVENABLES, for Hispaniola; where, however, the Spaniards got the \nbetter of the fight.  Consequently, the fleet came home again, \nafter taking Jamaica on the way.  Oliver, indignant with the two \ncommanders who had not done what bold Admiral Blake would have \ndone, clapped them both into prison, declared war against Spain, \nand made a treaty with France, in virtue of which it was to shelter \nthe King and his brother the Duke of York no longer.  Then, he sent \na fleet abroad under bold Admiral Blake, which brought the King of \nPortugal to his senses - just to keep its hand in - and then \nengaged a Spanish fleet, sunk four great ships, and took two more, \nladen with silver to the value of two millions of pounds:  which \ndazzling prize was brought from Portsmouth to London in waggons, \nwith the populace of all the towns and villages through which the \nwaggons passed, shouting with all their might.  After this victory, \nbold Admiral Blake sailed away to the port of Santa Cruz to cut off \nthe Spanish treasure-ships coming from Mexico.  There, he found \nthem, ten in number, with seven others to take care of them, and a \nbig castle, and seven batteries, all roaring and blazing away at \nhim with great guns.  Blake cared no more for great guns than for \npop-guns - no more for their hot iron balls than for snow-balls.  \nHe dashed into the harbour, captured and burnt every one of the \nships, and came sailing out again triumphantly, with the victorious \nEnglish flag flying at his masthead.  This was the last triumph of \nthis great commander, who had sailed and fought until he was quite \nworn out.  He died, as his successful ship was coming into Plymouth \nHarbour amidst the joyful acclamations of the people, and was \nburied in state in Westminster Abbey.  Not to lie there, long.\n\nOver and above all this, Oliver found that the VAUDOIS, or \nProtestant people of the valleys of Lucerne, were insolently \ntreated by the Catholic powers, and were even put to death for \ntheir religion, in an audacious and bloody manner.  Instantly, he \ninformed those powers that this was a thing which Protestant \nEngland would not allow; and he speedily carried his point, through \nthe might of his great name, and established their right to worship \nGod in peace after their own harmless manner.\n\nLastly, his English army won such admiration in fighting with the \nFrench against the Spaniards, that, after they had assaulted the \ntown of Dunkirk together, the French King in person gave it up to \nthe English, that it might be a token to them of their might and \nvalour.\n\nThere were plots enough against Oliver among the frantic \nreligionists (who called themselves Fifth Monarchy Men), and among \nthe disappointed Republicans.  He had a difficult game to play, for \nthe Royalists were always ready to side with either party against \nhim.  The \'King over the water,\' too, as Charles was called, had no \nscruples about plotting with any one against his life; although \nthere is reason to suppose that he would willingly have married one \nof his daughters, if Oliver would have had such a son-in-law.  \nThere was a certain COLONEL SAXBY of the army, once a great \nsupporter of Oliver\'s but now turned against him, who was a \ngrievous trouble to him through all this part of his career; and \nwho came and went between the discontented in England and Spain, \nand Charles who put himself in alliance with Spain on being thrown \noff by France.  This man died in prison at last; but not until \nthere had been very serious plots between the Royalists and \nRepublicans, and an actual rising of them in England, when they \nburst into the city of Salisbury, on a Sunday night, seized the \njudges who were going to hold the assizes there next day, and would \nhave hanged them but for the merciful objections of the more \ntemperate of their number.  Oliver was so vigorous and shrewd that \nhe soon put this revolt down, as he did most other conspiracies; \nand it was well for one of its chief managers - that same Lord \nWilmot who had assisted in Charles\'s flight, and was now EARL OF \nROCHESTER - that he made his escape.  Oliver seemed to have eyes \nand ears everywhere, and secured such sources of information as his \nenemies little dreamed of.  There was a chosen body of six persons, \ncalled the Sealed Knot, who were in the closest and most secret \nconfidence of Charles.  One of the foremost of these very men, a \nSIR RICHARD WILLIS, reported to Oliver everything that passed among \nthem, and had two hundred a year for it.\n\nMILES SYNDARCOMB, also of the old army, was another conspirator \nagainst the Protector.  He and a man named CECIL, bribed one of his \nLife Guards to let them have good notice when he was going out - \nintending to shoot him from a window.  But, owing either to his \ncaution or his good fortune, they could never get an aim at him.  \nDisappointed in this design, they got into the chapel in Whitehall, \nwith a basketful of combustibles, which were to explode by means of \na slow match in six hours; then, in the noise and confusion of the \nfire, they hoped to kill Oliver.  But, the Life Guardsman himself \ndisclosed this plot; and they were seized, and Miles died (or \nkilled himself in prison) a little while before he was ordered for \nexecution.  A few such plotters Oliver caused to be beheaded, a few \nmore to be hanged, and many more, including those who rose in arms \nagainst him, to be sent as slaves to the West Indies.  If he were \nrigid, he was impartial too, in asserting the laws of England.  \nWhen a Portuguese nobleman, the brother of the Portuguese \nambassador, killed a London citizen in mistake for another man with \nwhom he had had a quarrel, Oliver caused him to be tried before a \njury of Englishmen and foreigners, and had him executed in spite of \nthe entreaties of all the ambassadors in London.\n\nOne of Oliver\'s own friends, the DUKE OF OLDENBURGH, in sending him \na present of six fine coach-horses, was very near doing more to \nplease the Royalists than all the plotters put together.  One day, \nOliver went with his coach, drawn by these six horses, into Hyde \nPark, to dine with his secretary and some of his other gentlemen \nunder the trees there.  After dinner, being merry, he took it into \nhis head to put his friends inside and to drive them home:  a \npostillion riding one of the foremost horses, as the custom was.  \nOn account of Oliver\'s being too free with the whip, the six fine \nhorses went off at a gallop, the postillion got thrown, and Oliver \nfell upon the coach-pole and narrowly escaped being shot by his own \npistol, which got entangled with his clothes in the harness, and \nwent off.  He was dragged some distance by the foot, until his foot \ncame out of the shoe, and then he came safely to the ground under \nthe broad body of the coach, and was very little the worse.  The \ngentlemen inside were only bruised, and the discontented people of \nall parties were much disappointed.\n\nThe rest of the history of the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell is a \nhistory of his Parliaments.  His first one not pleasing him at all, \nhe waited until the five months were out, and then dissolved it.  \nThe next was better suited to his views; and from that he desired \nto get - if he could with safety to himself - the title of King.  \nHe had had this in his mind some time:  whether because he thought \nthat the English people, being more used to the title, were more \nlikely to obey it; or whether because he really wished to be a king \nhimself, and to leave the succession to that title in his family, \nis far from clear.  He was already as high, in England and in all \nthe world, as he would ever be, and I doubt if he cared for the \nmere name.  However, a paper, called the \'Humble Petition and \nAdvice,\' was presented to him by the House of Commons, praying him \nto take a high title and to appoint his successor.  That he would \nhave taken the title of King there is no doubt, but for the strong \nopposition of the army.  This induced him to forbear, and to assent \nonly to the other points of the petition.  Upon which occasion \nthere was another grand show in Westminster Hall, when the Speaker \nof the House of Commons formally invested him with a purple robe \nlined with ermine, and presented him with a splendidly bound Bible, \nand put a golden sceptre in his hand.  The next time the Parliament \nmet, he called a House of Lords of sixty members, as the petition \ngave him power to do; but as that Parliament did not please him \neither, and would not proceed to the business of the country, he \njumped into a coach one morning, took six Guards with him, and sent \nthem to the right-about.  I wish this had been a warning to \nParliaments to avoid long speeches, and do more work.\n\nIt was the month of August, one thousand six hundred and fifty-\neight, when Oliver Cromwell\'s favourite daughter, ELIZABETH \nCLAYPOLE (who had lately lost her youngest son), lay very ill, and \nhis mind was greatly troubled, because he loved her dearly.  \nAnother of his daughters was married to LORD FALCONBERG, another to \nthe grandson of the Earl of Warwick, and he had made his son \nRICHARD one of the Members of the Upper House.  He was very kind \nand loving to them all, being a good father and a good husband; but \nhe loved this daughter the best of the family, and went down to \nHampton Court to see her, and could hardly be induced to stir from \nher sick room until she died.  Although his religion had been of a \ngloomy kind, his disposition had been always cheerful.  He had been \nfond of music in his home, and had kept open table once a week for \nall officers of the army not below the rank of captain, and had \nalways preserved in his house a quiet, sensible dignity.  He \nencouraged men of genius and learning, and loved to have them about \nhim.  MILTON was one of his great friends.  He was good humoured \ntoo, with the nobility, whose dresses and manners were very \ndifferent from his; and to show them what good information he had, \nhe would sometimes jokingly tell them when they were his guests, \nwhere they had last drunk the health of the \'King over the water,\' \nand would recommend them to be more private (if they could) another \ntime.  But he had lived in busy times, had borne the weight of \nheavy State affairs, and had often gone in fear of his life.  He \nwas ill of the gout and ague; and when the death of his beloved \nchild came upon him in addition, he sank, never to raise his head \nagain.  He told his physicians on the twenty-fourth of August that \nthe Lord had assured him that he was not to die in that illness, \nand that he would certainly get better.  This was only his sick \nfancy, for on the third of September, which was the anniversary of \nthe great battle of Worcester, and the day of the year which he \ncalled his fortunate day, he died, in the sixtieth year of his age.  \nHe had been delirious, and had lain insensible some hours, but he \nhad been overheard to murmur a very good prayer the day before.  \nThe whole country lamented his death.  If you want to know the real \nworth of Oliver Cromwell, and his real services to his country, you \ncan hardly do better than compare England under him, with England \nunder CHARLES THE SECOND.\n\nHe had appointed his son Richard to succeed him, and after there \nhad been, at Somerset House in the Strand, a lying in state more \nsplendid than sensible - as all such vanities after death are, I \nthink - Richard became Lord Protector.  He was an amiable country \ngentleman, but had none of his father\'s great genius, and was quite \nunfit for such a post in such a storm of parties.  Richard\'s \nProtectorate, which only lasted a year and a half, is a history of \nquarrels between the officers of the army and the Parliament, and \nbetween the officers among themselves; and of a growing discontent \namong the people, who had far too many long sermons and far too few \namusements, and wanted a change.  At last, General Monk got the \narmy well into his own hands, and then in pursuance of a secret \nplan he seems to have entertained from the time of Oliver\'s death, \ndeclared for the King\'s cause.  He did not do this openly; but, in \nhis place in the House of Commons, as one of the members for \nDevonshire, strongly advocated the proposals of one SIR JOHN \nGREENVILLE, who came to the House with a letter from Charles, dated \nfrom Breda, and with whom he had previously been in secret \ncommunication.  There had been plots and counterplots, and a recall \nof the last members of the Long Parliament, and an end of the Long \nParliament, and risings of the Royalists that were made too soon; \nand most men being tired out, and there being no one to head the \ncountry now great Oliver was dead, it was readily agreed to welcome \nCharles Stuart.  Some of the wiser and better members said - what \nwas most true - that in the letter from Breda, he gave no real \npromise to govern well, and that it would be best to make him \npledge himself beforehand as to what he should be bound to do for \nthe benefit of the kingdom.  Monk said, however, it would be all \nright when he came, and he could not come too soon.\n\nSo, everybody found out all in a moment that the country MUST be \nprosperous and happy, having another Stuart to condescend to reign \nover it; and there was a prodigious firing off of guns, lighting of \nbonfires, ringing of bells, and throwing up of caps.  The people \ndrank the King\'s health by thousands in the open streets, and \neverybody rejoiced.  Down came the Arms of the Commonwealth, up \nwent the Royal Arms instead, and out came the public money.  Fifty \nthousand pounds for the King, ten thousand pounds for his brother \nthe Duke of York, five thousand pounds for his brother the Duke of \nGloucester.  Prayers for these gracious Stuarts were put up in all \nthe churches; commissioners were sent to Holland (which suddenly \nfound out that Charles was a great man, and that it loved him) to \ninvite the King home; Monk and the Kentish grandees went to Dover, \nto kneel down before him as he landed.  He kissed and embraced \nMonk, made him ride in the coach with himself and his brothers, \ncame on to London amid wonderful shoutings, and passed through the \narmy at Blackheath on the twenty-ninth of May (his birthday), in \nthe year one thousand six hundred and sixty.  Greeted by splendid \ndinners under tents, by flags and tapestry streaming from all the \nhouses, by delighted crowds in all the streets, by troops of \nnoblemen and gentlemen in rich dresses, by City companies, train-\nbands, drummers, trumpeters, the great Lord Mayor, and the majestic \nAldermen, the King went on to Whitehall.  On entering it, he \ncommemorated his Restoration with the joke that it really would \nseem to have been his own fault that he had not come long ago, \nsince everybody told him that he had always wished for him with all \nhis heart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV - ENGLAND UNDER CHARLES THE SECOND, CALLED THE MERRY \nMONARCH\n\n\n\nTHERE never were such profligate times in England as under Charles \nthe Second.  Whenever you see his portrait, with his swarthy, ill-\nlooking face and great nose, you may fancy him in his Court at \nWhitehall, surrounded by some of the very worst vagabonds in the \nkingdom (though they were lords and ladies), drinking, gambling, \nindulging in vicious conversation, and committing every kind of \nprofligate excess.  It has been a fashion to call Charles the \nSecond \'The Merry Monarch.\'  Let me try to give you a general idea \nof some of the merry things that were done, in the merry days when \nthis merry gentleman sat upon his merry throne, in merry England.\n\nThe first merry proceeding was - of course - to declare that he was \none of the greatest, the wisest, and the noblest kings that ever \nshone, like the blessed sun itself, on this benighted earth.  The \nnext merry and pleasant piece of business was, for the Parliament, \nin the humblest manner, to give him one million two hundred \nthousand pounds a year, and to settle upon him for life that old \ndisputed tonnage and poundage which had been so bravely fought for.  \nThen, General Monk being made EARL OF ALBEMARLE, and a few other \nRoyalists similarly rewarded, the law went to work to see what was \nto be done to those persons (they were called Regicides) who had \nbeen concerned in making a martyr of the late King.  Ten of these \nwere merrily executed; that is to say, six of the judges, one of \nthe council, Colonel Hacker and another officer who had commanded \nthe Guards, and HUGH PETERS, a preacher who had preached against \nthe martyr with all his heart.  These executions were so extremely \nmerry, that every horrible circumstance which Cromwell had \nabandoned was revived with appalling cruelty.  The hearts of the \nsufferers were torn out of their living bodies; their bowels were \nburned before their faces; the executioner cut jokes to the next \nvictim, as he rubbed his filthy hands together, that were reeking \nwith the blood of the last; and the heads of the dead were drawn on \nsledges with the living to the place of suffering.  Still, even so \nmerry a monarch could not force one of these dying men to say that \nhe was sorry for what he had done.  Nay, the most memorable thing \nsaid among them was, that if the thing were to do again they would \ndo it.\n\nSir Harry Vane, who had furnished the evidence against Strafford, \nand was one of the most staunch of the Republicans, was also tried, \nfound guilty, and ordered for execution.  When he came upon the \nscaffold on Tower Hill, after conducting his own defence with great \npower, his notes of what he had meant to say to the people were \ntorn away from him, and the drums and trumpets were ordered to \nsound lustily and drown his voice; for, the people had been so much \nimpressed by what the Regicides had calmly said with their last \nbreath, that it was the custom now, to have the drums and trumpets \nalways under the scaffold, ready to strike up.  Vane said no more \nthan this:  \'It is a bad cause which cannot bear the words of a \ndying man:\' and bravely died.\n\nThese merry scenes were succeeded by another, perhaps even merrier.  \nOn the anniversary of the late King\'s death, the bodies of Oliver \nCromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw, were torn out of their graves in \nWestminster Abbey, dragged to Tyburn, hanged there on a gallows all \nday long, and then beheaded.  Imagine the head of Oliver Cromwell \nset upon a pole to be stared at by a brutal crowd, not one of whom \nwould have dared to look the living Oliver in the face for half a \nmoment!  Think, after you have read this reign, what England was \nunder Oliver Cromwell who was torn out of his grave, and what it \nwas under this merry monarch who sold it, like a merry Judas, over \nand over again.\n\nOf course, the remains of Oliver\'s wife and daughter were not to be \nspared either, though they had been most excellent women.  The base \nclergy of that time gave up their bodies, which had been buried in \nthe Abbey, and - to the eternal disgrace of England - they were \nthrown into a pit, together with the mouldering bones of Pym and of \nthe brave and bold old Admiral Blake.\n\nThe clergy acted this disgraceful part because they hoped to get \nthe nonconformists, or dissenters, thoroughly put down in this \nreign, and to have but one prayer-book and one service for all \nkinds of people, no matter what their private opinions were.  This \nwas pretty well, I think, for a Protestant Church, which had \ndisplaced the Romish Church because people had a right to their own \nopinions in religious matters.  However, they carried it with a \nhigh hand, and a prayer-book was agreed upon, in which the \nextremest opinions of Archbishop Laud were not forgotten.  An Act \nwas passed, too, preventing any dissenter from holding any office \nunder any corporation.  So, the regular clergy in their triumph \nwere soon as merry as the King.  The army being by this time \ndisbanded, and the King crowned, everything was to go on easily for \nevermore.\n\nI must say a word here about the King\'s family.  He had not been \nlong upon the throne when his brother the Duke of Gloucester, and \nhis sister the PRINCESS OF ORANGE, died within a few months of each \nother, of small-pox.  His remaining sister, the PRINCESS HENRIETTA, \nmarried the DUKE OF ORLEANS, the brother of LOUIS THE FOURTEENTH, \nKing of France.  His brother JAMES, DUKE OF YORK, was made High \nAdmiral, and by-and-by became a Catholic.  He was a gloomy, sullen, \nbilious sort of man, with a remarkable partiality for the ugliest \nwomen in the country.  He married, under very discreditable \ncircumstances, ANNE HYDE, the daughter of LORD CLARENDON, then the \nKing\'s principal Minister - not at all a delicate minister either, \nbut doing much of the dirty work of a very dirty palace.  It became \nimportant now that the King himself should be married; and divers \nforeign Monarchs, not very particular about the character of their \nson-in-law, proposed their daughters to him.  The KING OF PORTUGAL \noffered his daughter, CATHERINE OF BRAGANZA, and fifty thousand \npounds:  in addition to which, the French King, who was favourable \nto that match, offered a loan of another fifty thousand.  The King \nof Spain, on the other hand, offered any one out of a dozen of \nPrincesses, and other hopes of gain.  But the ready money carried \nthe day, and Catherine came over in state to her merry marriage.\n\nThe whole Court was a great flaunting crowd of debauched men and \nshameless women; and Catherine\'s merry husband insulted and \noutraged her in every possible way, until she consented to receive \nthose worthless creatures as her very good friends, and to degrade \nherself by their companionship.  A MRS. PALMER, whom the King made \nLADY CASTLEMAINE, and afterwards DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND, was one of \nthe most powerful of the bad women about the Court, and had great \ninfluence with the King nearly all through his reign.  Another \nmerry lady named MOLL DAVIES, a dancer at the theatre, was \nafterwards her rival.  So was NELL GWYN, first an orange girl and \nthen an actress, who really had good in her, and of whom one of the \nworst things I know is, that actually she does seem to have been \nfond of the King.  The first DUKE OF ST. ALBANS was this orange \ngirl\'s child.  In like manner the son of a merry waiting-lady, whom \nthe King created DUCHESS OF PORTSMOUTH, became the DUKE OF \nRICHMOND.  Upon the whole it is not so bad a thing to be a \ncommoner.\n\nThe Merry Monarch was so exceedingly merry among these merry \nladies, and some equally merry (and equally infamous) lords and \ngentlemen, that he soon got through his hundred thousand pounds, \nand then, by way of raising a little pocket-money, made a merry \nbargain.  He sold Dunkirk to the French King for five millions of \nlivres.  When I think of the dignity to which Oliver Cromwell \nraised England in the eyes of foreign powers, and when I think of \nthe manner in which he gained for England this very Dunkirk, I am \nmuch inclined to consider that if the Merry Monarch had been made \nto follow his father for this action, he would have received his \njust deserts.\n\nThough he was like his father in none of that father\'s greater \nqualities, he was like him in being worthy of no trust.  When he \nsent that letter to the Parliament, from Breda, he did expressly \npromise that all sincere religious opinions should be respected.  \nYet he was no sooner firm in his power than he consented to one of \nthe worst Acts of Parliament ever passed.  Under this law, every \nminister who should not give his solemn assent to the Prayer-Book \nby a certain day, was declared to be a minister no longer, and to \nbe deprived of his church.  The consequence of this was that some \ntwo thousand honest men were taken from their congregations, and \nreduced to dire poverty and distress.  It was followed by another \noutrageous law, called the Conventicle Act, by which any person \nabove the age of sixteen who was present at any religious service \nnot according to the Prayer-Book, was to be imprisoned three months \nfor the first offence, six for the second, and to be transported \nfor the third.  This Act alone filled the prisons, which were then \nmost dreadful dungeons, to overflowing.\n\nThe Covenanters in Scotland had already fared no better.  A base \nParliament, usually known as the Drunken Parliament, in consequence \nof its principal members being seldom sober, had been got together \nto make laws against the Covenanters, and to force all men to be of \none mind in religious matters.  The MARQUIS OF ARGYLE, relying on \nthe King\'s honour, had given himself up to him; but, he was \nwealthy, and his enemies wanted his wealth.  He was tried for \ntreason, on the evidence of some private letters in which he had \nexpressed opinions - as well he might - more favourable to the \ngovernment of the late Lord Protector than of the present merry and \nreligious King.  He was executed, as were two men of mark among the \nCovenanters; and SHARP, a traitor who had once been the friend of \nthe Presbyterians and betrayed them, was made Archbishop of St. \nAndrew\'s, to teach the Scotch how to like bishops.\n\nThings being in this merry state at home, the Merry Monarch \nundertook a war with the Dutch; principally because they interfered \nwith an African company, established with the two objects of buying \ngold-dust and slaves, of which the Duke of York was a leading \nmember.  After some preliminary hostilities, the said Duke sailed \nto the coast of Holland with a fleet of ninety-eight vessels of \nwar, and four fire-ships.  This engaged with the Dutch fleet, of no \nfewer than one hundred and thirteen ships.  In the great battle \nbetween the two forces, the Dutch lost eighteen ships, four \nadmirals, and seven thousand men.  But, the English on shore were \nin no mood of exultation when they heard the news.\n\nFor, this was the year and the time of the Great Plague in London.  \nDuring the winter of one thousand six hundred and sixty-four it had \nbeen whispered about, that some few people had died here and there \nof the disease called the Plague, in some of the unwholesome \nsuburbs around London.  News was not published at that time as it \nis now, and some people believed these rumours, and some \ndisbelieved them, and they were soon forgotten.  But, in the month \nof May, one thousand six hundred and sixty-five, it began to be \nsaid all over the town that the disease had burst out with great \nviolence in St. Giles\'s, and that the people were dying in great \nnumbers.  This soon turned out to be awfully true.  The roads out \nof London were choked up by people endeavouring to escape from the \ninfected city, and large sums were paid for any kind of conveyance.  \nThe disease soon spread so fast, that it was necessary to shut up \nthe houses in which sick people were, and to cut them off from \ncommunication with the living.  Every one of these houses was \nmarked on the outside of the door with a red cross, and the words, \nLord, have mercy upon us!  The streets were all deserted, grass \ngrew in the public ways, and there was a dreadful silence in the \nair.  When night came on, dismal rumblings used to be heard, and \nthese were the wheels of the death-carts, attended by men with \nveiled faces and holding cloths to their mouths, who rang doleful \nbells and cried in a loud and solemn voice, \'Bring out your dead!\'  \nThe corpses put into these carts were buried by torchlight in great \npits; no service being performed over them; all men being afraid to \nstay for a moment on the brink of the ghastly graves.  In the \ngeneral fear, children ran away from their parents, and parents \nfrom their children.  Some who were taken ill, died alone, and \nwithout any help.  Some were stabbed or strangled by hired nurses \nwho robbed them of all their money, and stole the very beds on \nwhich they lay.  Some went mad, dropped from the windows, ran \nthrough the streets, and in their pain and frenzy flung themselves \ninto the river.\n\nThese were not all the horrors of the time.  The wicked and \ndissolute, in wild desperation, sat in the taverns singing roaring \nsongs, and were stricken as they drank, and went out and died.  The \nfearful and superstitious persuaded themselves that they saw \nsupernatural sights - burning swords in the sky, gigantic arms and \ndarts.  Others pretended that at nights vast crowds of ghosts \nwalked round and round the dismal pits.  One madman, naked, and \ncarrying a brazier full of burning coals upon his head, stalked \nthrough the streets, crying out that he was a Prophet, commissioned \nto denounce the vengeance of the Lord on wicked London.  Another \nalways went to and fro, exclaiming, \'Yet forty days, and London \nshall be destroyed!\'  A third awoke the echoes in the dismal \nstreets, by night and by day, and made the blood of the sick run \ncold, by calling out incessantly, in a deep hoarse voice, \'O, the \ngreat and dreadful God!\'\n\nThrough the months of July and August and September, the Great \nPlague raged more and more.  Great fires were lighted in the \nstreets, in the hope of stopping the infection; but there was a \nplague of rain too, and it beat the fires out.  At last, the winds \nwhich usually arise at that time of the year which is called the \nequinox, when day and night are of equal length all over the world, \nbegan to blow, and to purify the wretched town.  The deaths began \nto decrease, the red crosses slowly to disappear, the fugitives to \nreturn, the shops to open, pale frightened faces to be seen in the \nstreets.  The Plague had been in every part of England, but in \nclose and unwholesome London it had killed one hundred thousand \npeople.\n\nAll this time, the Merry Monarch was as merry as ever, and as \nworthless as ever.  All this time, the debauched lords and \ngentlemen and the shameless ladies danced and gamed and drank, and \nloved and hated one another, according to their merry ways.\n\nSo little humanity did the government learn from the late \naffliction, that one of the first things the Parliament did when it \nmet at Oxford (being as yet afraid to come to London), was to make \na law, called the Five Mile Act, expressly directed against those \npoor ministers who, in the time of the Plague, had manfully come \nback to comfort the unhappy people.  This infamous law, by \nforbidding them to teach in any school, or to come within five \nmiles of any city, town, or village, doomed them to starvation and \ndeath.\n\nThe fleet had been at sea, and healthy.  The King of France was now \nin alliance with the Dutch, though his navy was chiefly employed in \nlooking on while the English and Dutch fought.  The Dutch gained \none victory; and the English gained another and a greater; and \nPrince Rupert, one of the English admirals, was out in the Channel \none windy night, looking for the French Admiral, with the intention \nof giving him something more to do than he had had yet, when the \ngale increased to a storm, and blew him into Saint Helen\'s.  That \nnight was the third of September, one thousand six hundred and \nsixty-six, and that wind fanned the Great Fire of London.\n\nIt broke out at a baker\'s shop near London Bridge, on the spot on \nwhich the Monument now stands as a remembrance of those raging \nflames.  It spread and spread, and burned and burned, for three \ndays.  The nights were lighter than the days; in the daytime there \nwas an immense cloud of smoke, and in the night-time there was a \ngreat tower of fire mounting up into the sky, which lighted the \nwhole country landscape for ten miles round.  Showers of hot ashes \nrose into the air and fell on distant places; flying sparks carried \nthe conflagration to great distances, and kindled it in twenty new \nspots at a time; church steeples fell down with tremendous crashes; \nhouses crumbled into cinders by the hundred and the thousand.  The \nsummer had been intensely hot and dry, the streets were very \nnarrow, and the houses mostly built of wood and plaster.  Nothing \ncould stop the tremendous fire, but the want of more houses to \nburn; nor did it stop until the whole way from the Tower to Temple \nBar was a desert, composed of the ashes of thirteen thousand houses \nand eighty-nine churches.\n\nThis was a terrible visitation at the time, and occasioned great \nloss and suffering to the two hundred thousand burnt-out people, \nwho were obliged to lie in the fields under the open night sky, or \nin hastily-made huts of mud and straw, while the lanes and roads \nwere rendered impassable by carts which had broken down as they \ntried to save their goods.  But the Fire was a great blessing to \nthe City afterwards, for it arose from its ruins very much improved \n- built more regularly, more widely, more cleanly and carefully, \nand therefore much more healthily.  It might be far more healthy \nthan it is, but there are some people in it still - even now, at \nthis time, nearly two hundred years later - so selfish, so pig-\nheaded, and so ignorant, that I doubt if even another Great Fire \nwould warm them up to do their duty.\n\nThe Catholics were accused of having wilfully set London in flames; \none poor Frenchman, who had been mad for years, even accused \nhimself of having with his own hand fired the first house.  There \nis no reasonable doubt, however, that the fire was accidental.  An \ninscription on the Monument long attributed it to the Catholics; \nbut it is removed now, and was always a malicious and stupid \nuntruth.\n\n\nSECOND PART\n\n\nTHAT the Merry Monarch might be very merry indeed, in the merry \ntimes when his people were suffering under pestilence and fire, he \ndrank and gambled and flung away among his favourites the money \nwhich the Parliament had voted for the war.  The consequence of \nthis was that the stout-hearted English sailors were merrily \nstarving of want, and dying in the streets; while the Dutch, under \ntheir admirals DE WITT and DE RUYTER, came into the River Thames, \nand up the River Medway as far as Upnor, burned the guard-ships, \nsilenced the weak batteries, and did what they would to the English \ncoast for six whole weeks.  Most of the English ships that could \nhave prevented them had neither powder nor shot on board; in this \nmerry reign, public officers made themselves as merry as the King \ndid with the public money; and when it was entrusted to them to \nspend in national defences or preparations, they put it into their \nown pockets with the merriest grace in the world.\n\nLord Clarendon had, by this time, run as long a course as is \nusually allotted to the unscrupulous ministers of bad kings.  He \nwas impeached by his political opponents, but unsuccessfully.  The \nKing then commanded him to withdraw from England and retire to \nFrance, which he did, after defending himself in writing.  He was \nno great loss at home, and died abroad some seven years afterwards.\n\nThere then came into power a ministry called the Cabal Ministry, \nbecause it was composed of LORD CLIFFORD, the EARL OF ARLINGTON, \nthe DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM (a great rascal, and the King\'s most \npowerful favourite), LORD ASHLEY, and the DUKE OF LAUDERDALE, C. A. \nB. A. L.  As the French were making conquests in Flanders, the \nfirst Cabal proceeding was to make a treaty with the Dutch, for \nuniting with Spain to oppose the French.  It was no sooner made \nthan the Merry Monarch, who always wanted to get money without \nbeing accountable to a Parliament for his expenditure, apologised \nto the King of France for having had anything to do with it, and \nconcluded a secret treaty with him, making himself his infamous \npensioner to the amount of two millions of livres down, and three \nmillions more a year; and engaging to desert that very Spain, to \nmake war against those very Dutch, and to declare himself a \nCatholic when a convenient time should arrive.  This religious king \nhad lately been crying to his Catholic brother on the subject of \nhis strong desire to be a Catholic; and now he merrily concluded \nthis treasonable conspiracy against the country he governed, by \nundertaking to become one as soon as he safely could.  For all of \nwhich, though he had had ten merry heads instead of one, he richly \ndeserved to lose them by the headsman\'s axe.\n\nAs his one merry head might have been far from safe, if these \nthings had been known, they were kept very quiet, and war was \ndeclared by France and England against the Dutch.  But, a very \nuncommon man, afterwards most important to English history and to \nthe religion and liberty of this land, arose among them, and for \nmany long years defeated the whole projects of France.  This was \nWILLIAM OF NASSAU, PRINCE OF ORANGE, son of the last Prince of \nOrange of the same name, who married the daughter of Charles the \nFirst of England.  He was a young man at this time, only just of \nage; but he was brave, cool, intrepid, and wise.  His father had \nbeen so detested that, upon his death, the Dutch had abolished the \nauthority to which this son would have otherwise succeeded \n(Stadtholder it was called), and placed the chief power in the \nhands of JOHN DE WITT, who educated this young prince.  Now, the \nPrince became very popular, and John de Witt\'s brother CORNELIUS \nwas sentenced to banishment on a false accusation of conspiring to \nkill him.  John went to the prison where he was, to take him away \nto exile, in his coach; and a great mob who collected on the \noccasion, then and there cruelly murdered both the brothers.  This \nleft the government in the hands of the Prince, who was really the \nchoice of the nation; and from this time he exercised it with the \ngreatest vigour, against the whole power of France, under its \nfamous generals CONDE and TURENNE, and in support of the Protestant \nreligion.  It was full seven years before this war ended in a \ntreaty of peace made at Nimeguen, and its details would occupy a \nvery considerable space.  It is enough to say that William of \nOrange established a famous character with the whole world; and \nthat the Merry Monarch, adding to and improving on his former \nbaseness, bound himself to do everything the King of France liked, \nand nothing the King of France did not like, for a pension of one \nhundred thousand pounds a year, which was afterwards doubled.  \nBesides this, the King of France, by means of his corrupt \nambassador - who wrote accounts of his proceedings in England, \nwhich are not always to be believed, I think - bought our English \nmembers of Parliament, as he wanted them.  So, in point of fact, \nduring a considerable portion of this merry reign, the King of \nFrance was the real King of this country.\n\nBut there was a better time to come, and it was to come (though his \nroyal uncle little thought so) through that very William, Prince of \nOrange.  He came over to England, saw Mary, the elder daughter of \nthe Duke of York, and married her.  We shall see by-and-by what \ncame of that marriage, and why it is never to be forgotten.\n\nThis daughter was a Protestant, but her mother died a Catholic.  \nShe and her sister ANNE, also a Protestant, were the only survivors \nof eight children.  Anne afterwards married GEORGE, PRINCE OF \nDENMARK, brother to the King of that country.\n\nLest you should do the Merry Monarch the injustice of supposing \nthat he was even good humoured (except when he had everything his \nown way), or that he was high spirited and honourable, I will \nmention here what was done to a member of the House of Commons, SIR \nJOHN COVENTRY.  He made a remark in a debate about taxing the \ntheatres, which gave the King offence.  The King agreed with his \nillegitimate son, who had been born abroad, and whom he had made \nDUKE OF MONMOUTH, to take the following merry vengeance.  To waylay \nhim at night, fifteen armed men to one, and to slit his nose with a \npenknife.  Like master, like man.  The King\'s favourite, the Duke \nof Buckingham, was strongly suspected of setting on an assassin to \nmurder the DUKE OF ORMOND as he was returning home from a dinner; \nand that Duke\'s spirited son, LORD OSSORY, was so persuaded of his \nguilt, that he said to him at Court, even as he stood beside the \nKing, \'My lord, I know very well that you are at the bottom of this \nlate attempt upon my father.  But I give you warning, if he ever \ncome to a violent end, his blood shall be upon you, and wherever I \nmeet you I will pistol you!  I will do so, though I find you \nstanding behind the King\'s chair; and I tell you this in his \nMajesty\'s presence, that you may be quite sure of my doing what I \nthreaten.\'  Those were merry times indeed.\n\nThere was a fellow named BLOOD, who was seized for making, with two \ncompanions, an audacious attempt to steal the crown, the globe, and \nsceptre, from the place where the jewels were kept in the Tower.  \nThis robber, who was a swaggering ruffian, being taken, declared \nthat he was the man who had endeavoured to kill the Duke of Ormond, \nand that he had meant to kill the King too, but was overawed by the \nmajesty of his appearance, when he might otherwise have done it, as \nhe was bathing at Battersea.  The King being but an ill-looking \nfellow, I don\'t believe a word of this.  Whether he was flattered, \nor whether he knew that Buckingham had really set Blood on to \nmurder the Duke, is uncertain.  But it is quite certain that he \npardoned this thief, gave him an estate of five hundred a year in \nIreland (which had had the honour of giving him birth), and \npresented him at Court to the debauched lords and the shameless \nladies, who made a great deal of him - as I have no doubt they \nwould have made of the Devil himself, if the King had introduced \nhim.\n\nInfamously pensioned as he was, the King still wanted money, and \nconsequently was obliged to call Parliaments.  In these, the great \nobject of the Protestants was to thwart the Catholic Duke of York, \nwho married a second time; his new wife being a young lady only \nfifteen years old, the Catholic sister of the DUKE OF MODENA.  In \nthis they were seconded by the Protestant Dissenters, though to \ntheir own disadvantage:  since, to exclude Catholics from power, \nthey were even willing to exclude themselves.  The King\'s object \nwas to pretend to be a Protestant, while he was really a Catholic; \nto swear to the bishops that he was devoutly attached to the \nEnglish Church, while he knew he had bargained it away to the King \nof France; and by cheating and deceiving them, and all who were \nattached to royalty, to become despotic and be powerful enough to \nconfess what a rascal he was.  Meantime, the King of France, \nknowing his merry pensioner well, intrigued with the King\'s \nopponents in Parliament, as well as with the King and his friends.\n\nThe fears that the country had of the Catholic religion being \nrestored, if the Duke of York should come to the throne, and the \nlow cunning of the King in pretending to share their alarms, led to \nsome very terrible results.  A certain DR. TONGE, a dull clergyman \nin the City, fell into the hands of a certain TITUS OATES, a most \ninfamous character, who pretended to have acquired among the \nJesuits abroad a knowledge of a great plot for the murder of the \nKing, and the re-establishment if the Catholic religion.  Titus \nOates, being produced by this unlucky Dr. Tonge and solemnly \nexamined before the council, contradicted himself in a thousand \nways, told the most ridiculous and improbable stories, and \nimplicated COLEMAN, the Secretary of the Duchess of York.  Now, \nalthough what he charged against Coleman was not true, and although \nyou and I know very well that the real dangerous Catholic plot was \nthat one with the King of France of which the Merry Monarch was \nhimself the head, there happened to be found among Coleman\'s \npapers, some letters, in which he did praise the days of Bloody \nQueen Mary, and abuse the Protestant religion.  This was great good \nfortune for Titus, as it seemed to confirm him; but better still \nwas in store.  SIR EDMUNDBURY GODFREY, the magistrate who had first \nexamined him, being unexpectedly found dead near Primrose Hill, was \nconfidently believed to have been killed by the Catholics.  I think \nthere is no doubt that he had been melancholy mad, and that he \nkilled himself; but he had a great Protestant funeral, and Titus \nwas called the Saver of the Nation, and received a pension of \ntwelve hundred pounds a year.\n\nAs soon as Oates\'s wickedness had met with this success, up started \nanother villain, named WILLIAM BEDLOE, who, attracted by a reward \nof five hundred pounds offered for the apprehension of the \nmurderers of Godfrey, came forward and charged two Jesuits and some \nother persons with having committed it at the Queen\'s desire.  \nOates, going into partnership with this new informer, had the \naudacity to accuse the poor Queen herself of high treason.  Then \nappeared a third informer, as bad as either of the two, and accused \na Catholic banker named STAYLEY of having said that the King was \nthe greatest rogue in the world (which would not have been far from \nthe truth), and that he would kill him with his own hand.  This \nbanker, being at once tried and executed, Coleman and two others \nwere tried and executed.  Then, a miserable wretch named PRANCE, a \nCatholic silversmith, being accused by Bedloe, was tortured into \nconfessing that he had taken part in Godfrey\'s murder, and into \naccusing three other men of having committed it.  Then, five \nJesuits were accused by Oates, Bedloe, and Prance together, and \nwere all found guilty, and executed on the same kind of \ncontradictory and absurd evidence.  The Queen\'s physician and three \nmonks were next put on their trial; but Oates and Bedloe had for \nthe time gone far enough and these four were acquitted.  The public \nmind, however, was so full of a Catholic plot, and so strong \nagainst the Duke of York, that James consented to obey a written \norder from his brother, and to go with his family to Brussels, \nprovided that his rights should never be sacrificed in his absence \nto the Duke of Monmouth.  The House of Commons, not satisfied with \nthis as the King hoped, passed a bill to exclude the Duke from ever \nsucceeding to the throne.  In return, the King dissolved the \nParliament.  He had deserted his old favourite, the Duke of \nBuckingham, who was now in the opposition.\n\nTo give any sufficient idea of the miseries of Scotland in this \nmerry reign, would occupy a hundred pages.  Because the people \nwould not have bishops, and were resolved to stand by their solemn \nLeague and Covenant, such cruelties were inflicted upon them as \nmake the blood run cold.  Ferocious dragoons galloped through the \ncountry to punish the peasants for deserting the churches; sons \nwere hanged up at their fathers\' doors for refusing to disclose \nwhere their fathers were concealed; wives were tortured to death \nfor not betraying their husbands; people were taken out of their \nfields and gardens, and shot on the public roads without trial; \nlighted matches were tied to the fingers of prisoners, and a most \nhorrible torment called the Boot was invented, and constantly \napplied, which ground and mashed the victims\' legs with iron \nwedges.  Witnesses were tortured as well as prisoners.  All the \nprisons were full; all the gibbets were heavy with bodies; murder \nand plunder devastated the whole country.  In spite of all, the \nCovenanters were by no means to be dragged into the churches, and \npersisted in worshipping God as they thought right.  A body of \nferocious Highlanders, turned upon them from the mountains of their \nown country, had no greater effect than the English dragoons under \nGRAHAME OF CLAVERHOUSE, the most cruel and rapacious of all their \nenemies, whose name will ever be cursed through the length and \nbreadth of Scotland.  Archbishop Sharp had ever aided and abetted \nall these outrages.  But he fell at last; for, when the injuries of \nthe Scottish people were at their height, he was seen, in his \ncoach-and-six coming across a moor, by a body of men, headed by one \nJOHN BALFOUR, who were waiting for another of their oppressors.  \nUpon this they cried out that Heaven had delivered him into their \nhands, and killed him with many wounds.  If ever a man deserved \nsuch a death, I think Archbishop Sharp did.\n\nIt made a great noise directly, and the Merry Monarch - strongly \nsuspected of having goaded the Scottish people on, that he might \nhave an excuse for a greater army than the Parliament were willing \nto give him - sent down his son, the Duke of Monmouth, as \ncommander-in-chief, with instructions to attack the Scottish \nrebels, or Whigs as they were called, whenever he came up with \nthem.  Marching with ten thousand men from Edinburgh, he found \nthem, in number four or five thousand, drawn up at Bothwell Bridge, \nby the Clyde.  They were soon dispersed; and Monmouth showed a more \nhumane character towards them, than he had shown towards that \nMember of Parliament whose nose he had caused to be slit with a \npenknife.  But the Duke of Lauderdale was their bitter foe, and \nsent Claverhouse to finish them.\n\nAs the Duke of York became more and more unpopular, the Duke of \nMonmouth became more and more popular.  It would have been decent \nin the latter not to have voted in favour of the renewed bill for \nthe exclusion of James from the throne; but he did so, much to the \nKing\'s amusement, who used to sit in the House of Lords by the \nfire, hearing the debates, which he said were as good as a play.  \nThe House of Commons passed the bill by a large majority, and it \nwas carried up to the House of Lords by LORD RUSSELL, one of the \nbest of the leaders on the Protestant side.  It was rejected there, \nchiefly because the bishops helped the King to get rid of it; and \nthe fear of Catholic plots revived again.  There had been another \ngot up, by a fellow out of Newgate, named DANGERFIELD, which is \nmore famous than it deserves to be, under the name of the MEAL-TUB \nPLOT.  This jail-bird having been got out of Newgate by a MRS. \nCELLIER, a Catholic nurse, had turned Catholic himself, and \npretended that he knew of a plot among the Presbyterians against \nthe King\'s life.  This was very pleasant to the Duke of York, who \nhated the Presbyterians, who returned the compliment.  He gave \nDangerfield twenty guineas, and sent him to the King his brother.  \nBut Dangerfield, breaking down altogether in his charge, and being \nsent back to Newgate, almost astonished the Duke out of his five \nsenses by suddenly swearing that the Catholic nurse had put that \nfalse design into his head, and that what he really knew about, \nwas, a Catholic plot against the King; the evidence of which would \nbe found in some papers, concealed in a meal-tub in Mrs. Cellier\'s \nhouse.  There they were, of course - for he had put them there \nhimself - and so the tub gave the name to the plot.  But, the nurse \nwas acquitted on her trial, and it came to nothing.\n\nLord Ashley, of the Cabal, was now Lord Shaftesbury, and was strong \nagainst the succession of the Duke of York.  The House of Commons, \naggravated to the utmost extent, as we may well suppose, by \nsuspicions of the King\'s conspiracy with the King of France, made a \ndesperate point of the exclusion, still, and were bitter against \nthe Catholics generally.  So unjustly bitter were they, I grieve to \nsay, that they impeached the venerable Lord Stafford, a Catholic \nnobleman seventy years old, of a design to kill the King.  The \nwitnesses were that atrocious Oates and two other birds of the same \nfeather.  He was found guilty, on evidence quite as foolish as it \nwas false, and was beheaded on Tower Hill.  The people were opposed \nto him when he first appeared upon the scaffold; but, when he had \naddressed them and shown them how innocent he was and how wickedly \nhe was sent there, their better nature was aroused, and they said, \n\'We believe you, my Lord.  God bless you, my Lord!\'\n\nThe House of Commons refused to let the King have any money until \nhe should consent to the Exclusion Bill; but, as he could get it \nand did get it from his master the King of France, he could afford \nto hold them very cheap.  He called a Parliament at Oxford, to \nwhich he went down with a great show of being armed and protected \nas if he were in danger of his life, and to which the opposition \nmembers also went armed and protected, alleging that they were in \nfear of the Papists, who were numerous among the King\'s guards.  \nHowever, they went on with the Exclusion Bill, and were so earnest \nupon it that they would have carried it again, if the King had not \npopped his crown and state robes into a sedan-chair, bundled \nhimself into it along with them, hurried down to the chamber where \nthe House of Lords met, and dissolved the Parliament.  After which \nhe scampered home, and the members of Parliament scampered home \ntoo, as fast as their legs could carry them.\n\nThe Duke of York, then residing in Scotland, had, under the law \nwhich excluded Catholics from public trust, no right whatever to \npublic employment.  Nevertheless, he was openly employed as the \nKing\'s representative in Scotland, and there gratified his sullen \nand cruel nature to his heart\'s content by directing the dreadful \ncruelties against the Covenanters.  There were two ministers named \nCARGILL and CAMERON who had escaped from the battle of Bothwell \nBridge, and who returned to Scotland, and raised the miserable but \nstill brave and unsubdued Covenanters afresh, under the name of \nCameronians.  As Cameron publicly posted a declaration that the \nKing was a forsworn tyrant, no mercy was shown to his unhappy \nfollowers after he was slain in battle.  The Duke of York, who was \nparticularly fond of the Boot and derived great pleasure from \nhaving it applied, offered their lives to some of these people, if \nthey would cry on the scaffold \'God save the King!\'  But their \nrelations, friends, and countrymen, had been so barbarously \ntortured and murdered in this merry reign, that they preferred to \ndie, and did die.  The Duke then obtained his merry brother\'s \npermission to hold a Parliament in Scotland, which first, with most \nshameless deceit, confirmed the laws for securing the Protestant \nreligion against Popery, and then declared that nothing must or \nshould prevent the succession of the Popish Duke.  After this \ndouble-faced beginning, it established an oath which no human being \ncould understand, but which everybody was to take, as a proof that \nhis religion was the lawful religion.  The Earl of Argyle, taking \nit with the explanation that he did not consider it to prevent him \nfrom favouring any alteration either in the Church or State which \nwas not inconsistent with the Protestant religion or with his \nloyalty, was tried for high treason before a Scottish jury of which \nthe MARQUIS OF MONTROSE was foreman, and was found guilty.  He \nescaped the scaffold, for that time, by getting away, in the \ndisguise of a page, in the train of his daughter, LADY SOPHIA \nLINDSAY.  It was absolutely proposed, by certain members of the \nScottish Council, that this lady should be whipped through the \nstreets of Edinburgh.  But this was too much even for the Duke, who \nhad the manliness then (he had very little at most times) to remark \nthat Englishmen were not accustomed to treat ladies in that manner.  \nIn those merry times nothing could equal the brutal servility of \nthe Scottish fawners, but the conduct of similar degraded beings in \nEngland.\n\nAfter the settlement of these little affairs, the Duke returned to \nEngland, and soon resumed his place at the Council, and his office \nof High Admiral - all this by his brother\'s favour, and in open \ndefiance of the law.  It would have been no loss to the country, if \nhe had been drowned when his ship, in going to Scotland to fetch \nhis family, struck on a sand-bank, and was lost with two hundred \nsouls on board.  But he escaped in a boat with some friends; and \nthe sailors were so brave and unselfish, that, when they saw him \nrowing away, they gave three cheers, while they themselves were \ngoing down for ever.\n\nThe Merry Monarch, having got rid of his Parliament, went to work \nto make himself despotic, with all speed.  Having had the villainy \nto order the execution of OLIVER PLUNKET, BISHOP OF ARMAGH, falsely \naccused of a plot to establish Popery in that country by means of a \nFrench army - the very thing this royal traitor was himself trying \nto do at home - and having tried to ruin Lord Shaftesbury, and \nfailed - he turned his hand to controlling the corporations all \nover the country; because, if he could only do that, he could get \nwhat juries he chose, to bring in perjured verdicts, and could get \nwhat members he chose returned to Parliament.  These merry times \nproduced, and made Chief Justice of the Court of King\'s Bench, a \ndrunken ruffian of the name of JEFFREYS; a red-faced, swollen, \nbloated, horrible creature, with a bullying, roaring voice, and a \nmore savage nature perhaps than was ever lodged in any human \nbreast.  This monster was the Merry Monarch\'s especial favourite, \nand he testified his admiration of him by giving him a ring from \nhis own finger, which the people used to call Judge Jeffreys\'s \nBloodstone.  Him the King employed to go about and bully the \ncorporations, beginning with London; or, as Jeffreys himself \nelegantly called it, \'to give them a lick with the rough side of \nhis tongue.\'  And he did it so thoroughly, that they soon became \nthe basest and most sycophantic bodies in the kingdom - except the \nUniversity of Oxford, which, in that respect, was quite pre-eminent \nand unapproachable.\n\nLord Shaftesbury (who died soon after the King\'s failure against \nhim), LORD WILLIAM RUSSELL, the Duke of Monmouth, LORD HOWARD, LORD \nJERSEY, ALGERNON SIDNEY, JOHN HAMPDEN (grandson of the great \nHampden), and some others, used to hold a council together after \nthe dissolution of the Parliament, arranging what it might be \nnecessary to do, if the King carried his Popish plot to the utmost \nheight.  Lord Shaftesbury having been much the most violent of this \nparty, brought two violent men into their secrets - RUMSEY, who had \nbeen a soldier in the Republican army; and WEST, a lawyer.  These \ntwo knew an old officer of CROMWELL\'S, called RUMBOLD, who had \nmarried a maltster\'s widow, and so had come into possession of a \nsolitary dwelling called the Rye House, near Hoddesdon, in \nHertfordshire.  Rumbold said to them what a capital place this \nhouse of his would be from which to shoot at the King, who often \npassed there going to and fro from Newmarket.  They liked the idea, \nand entertained it.  But, one of their body gave information; and \nthey, together with SHEPHERD a wine merchant, Lord Russell, \nAlgernon Sidney, LORD ESSEX, LORD HOWARD, and Hampden, were all \narrested.\n\nLord Russell might have easily escaped, but scorned to do so, being \ninnocent of any wrong; Lord Essex might have easily escaped, but \nscorned to do so, lest his flight should prejudice Lord Russell.  \nBut it weighed upon his mind that he had brought into their \ncouncil, Lord Howard - who now turned a miserable traitor - against \na great dislike Lord Russell had always had of him.  He could not \nbear the reflection, and destroyed himself before Lord Russell was \nbrought to trial at the Old Bailey.\n\nHe knew very well that he had nothing to hope, having always been \nmanful in the Protestant cause against the two false brothers, the \none on the throne, and the other standing next to it.  He had a \nwife, one of the noblest and best of women, who acted as his \nsecretary on his trial, who comforted him in his prison, who supped \nwith him on the night before he died, and whose love and virtue and \ndevotion have made her name imperishable.  Of course, he was found \nguilty, and was sentenced to be beheaded in Lincoln\'s Inn-fields, \nnot many yards from his own house.  When he had parted from his \nchildren on the evening before his death, his wife still stayed \nwith him until ten o\'clock at night; and when their final \nseparation in this world was over, and he had kissed her many \ntimes, he still sat for a long while in his prison, talking of her \ngoodness.  Hearing the rain fall fast at that time, he calmly said, \n\'Such a rain to-morrow will spoil a great show, which is a dull \nthing on a rainy day.\'  At midnight he went to bed, and slept till \nfour; even when his servant called him, he fell asleep again while \nhis clothes were being made ready.  He rode to the scaffold in his \nown carriage, attended by two famous clergymen, TILLOTSON and \nBURNET, and sang a psalm to himself very softly, as he went along.  \nHe was as quiet and as steady as if he had been going out for an \nordinary ride.  After saying that he was surprised to see so great \na crowd, he laid down his head upon the block, as if upon the \npillow of his bed, and had it struck off at the second blow.  His \nnoble wife was busy for him even then; for that true-hearted lady \nprinted and widely circulated his last words, of which he had given \nher a copy.  They made the blood of all the honest men in England \nboil.\n\nThe University of Oxford distinguished itself on the very same day \nby pretending to believe that the accusation against Lord Russell \nwas true, and by calling the King, in a written paper, the Breath \nof their Nostrils and the Anointed of the Lord.  This paper the \nParliament afterwards caused to be burned by the common hangman; \nwhich I am sorry for, as I wish it had been framed and glazed and \nhung up in some public place, as a monument of baseness for the \nscorn of mankind.\n\nNext, came the trial of Algernon Sidney, at which Jeffreys \npresided, like a great crimson toad, sweltering and swelling with \nrage.  \'I pray God, Mr. Sidney,\' said this Chief Justice of a merry \nreign, after passing sentence, \'to work in you a temper fit to go \nto the other world, for I see you are not fit for this.\'  \'My \nlord,\' said the prisoner, composedly holding out his arm, \'feel my \npulse, and see if I be disordered.  I thank Heaven I never was in \nbetter temper than I am now.\'  Algernon Sidney was executed on \nTower Hill, on the seventh of December, one thousand six hundred \nand eighty-three.  He died a hero, and died, in his own words, \'For \nthat good old cause in which he had been engaged from his youth, \nand for which God had so often and so wonderfully declared \nhimself.\'\n\nThe Duke of Monmouth had been making his uncle, the Duke of York, \nvery jealous, by going about the country in a royal sort of way, \nplaying at the people\'s games, becoming godfather to their \nchildren, and even touching for the King\'s evil, or stroking the \nfaces of the sick to cure them - though, for the matter of that, I \nshould say he did them about as much good as any crowned king could \nhave done.  His father had got him to write a letter, confessing \nhis having had a part in the conspiracy, for which Lord Russell had \nbeen beheaded; but he was ever a weak man, and as soon as he had \nwritten it, he was ashamed of it and got it back again.  For this, \nhe was banished to the Netherlands; but he soon returned and had an \ninterview with his father, unknown to his uncle.  It would seem \nthat he was coming into the Merry Monarch\'s favour again, and that \nthe Duke of York was sliding out of it, when Death appeared to the \nmerry galleries at Whitehall, and astonished the debauched lords \nand gentlemen, and the shameless ladies, very considerably.\n\nOn Monday, the second of February, one thousand six hundred and \neighty-five, the merry pensioner and servant of the King of France \nfell down in a fit of apoplexy.  By the Wednesday his case was \nhopeless, and on the Thursday he was told so.  As he made a \ndifficulty about taking the sacrament from the Protestant Bishop of \nBath, the Duke of York got all who were present away from the bed, \nand asked his brother, in a whisper, if he should send for a \nCatholic priest?   The King replied, \'For God\'s sake, brother, do!\'  \nThe Duke smuggled in, up the back stairs, disguised in a wig and \ngown, a priest named HUDDLESTON, who had saved the King\'s life \nafter the battle of Worcester:  telling him that this worthy man in \nthe wig had once saved his body, and was now come to save his soul.\n\nThe Merry Monarch lived through that night, and died before noon on \nthe next day, which was Friday, the sixth.  Two of the last things \nhe said were of a human sort, and your remembrance will give him \nthe full benefit of them.  When the Queen sent to say she was too \nunwell to attend him and to ask his pardon, he said, \'Alas! poor \nwoman, SHE beg MY pardon!  I beg hers with all my heart.  Take back \nthat answer to her.\'  And he also said, in reference to Nell Gwyn, \n\'Do not let poor Nelly starve.\'\n\nHe died in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and the twenty-fifth of \nhis reign.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI - ENGLAND UNDER JAMES THE SECOND\n\n\n\nKING JAMES THE SECOND was a man so very disagreeable, that even the \nbest of historians has favoured his brother Charles, as becoming, \nby comparison, quite a pleasant character.  The one object of his \nshort reign was to re-establish the Catholic religion in England; \nand this he doggedly pursued with such a stupid obstinacy, that his \ncareer very soon came to a close.\n\nThe first thing he did, was, to assure his council that he would \nmake it his endeavour to preserve the Government, both in Church \nand State, as it was by law established; and that he would always \ntake care to defend and support the Church.  Great public \nacclamations were raised over this fair speech, and a great deal \nwas said, from the pulpits and elsewhere, about the word of a King \nwhich was never broken, by credulous people who little supposed \nthat he had formed a secret council for Catholic affairs, of which \na mischievous Jesuit, called FATHER PETRE, was one of the chief \nmembers.  With tears of joy in his eyes, he received, as the \nbeginning of HIS pension from the King of France, five hundred \nthousand livres; yet, with a mixture of meanness and arrogance that \nbelonged to his contemptible character, he was always jealous of \nmaking some show of being independent of the King of France, while \nhe pocketed his money.  As - notwithstanding his publishing two \npapers in favour of Popery (and not likely to do it much service, I \nshould think) written by the King, his brother, and found in his \nstrong-box; and his open display of himself attending mass - the \nParliament was very obsequious, and granted him a large sum of \nmoney, he began his reign with a belief that he could do what he \npleased, and with a determination to do it.\n\nBefore we proceed to its principal events, let us dispose of Titus \nOates.  He was tried for perjury, a fortnight after the coronation, \nand besides being very heavily fined, was sentenced to stand twice \nin the pillory, to be whipped from Aldgate to Newgate one day, and \nfrom Newgate to Tyburn two days afterwards, and to stand in the \npillory five times a year as long as he lived.  This fearful \nsentence was actually inflicted on the rascal.  Being unable to \nstand after his first flogging, he was dragged on a sledge from \nNewgate to Tyburn, and flogged as he was drawn along.  He was so \nstrong a villain that he did not die under the torture, but lived \nto be afterwards pardoned and rewarded, though not to be ever \nbelieved in any more.  Dangerfield, the only other one of that crew \nleft alive, was not so fortunate.  He was almost killed by a \nwhipping from Newgate to Tyburn, and, as if that were not \npunishment enough, a ferocious barrister of Gray\'s Inn gave him a \npoke in the eye with his cane, which caused his death; for which \nthe ferocious barrister was deservedly tried and executed.\n\nAs soon as James was on the throne, Argyle and Monmouth went from \nBrussels to Rotterdam, and attended a meeting of Scottish exiles \nheld there, to concert measures for a rising in England.  It was \nagreed that Argyle should effect a landing in Scotland, and \nMonmouth in England; and that two Englishmen should be sent with \nArgyle to be in his confidence, and two Scotchmen with the Duke of \nMonmouth.\n\nArgyle was the first to act upon this contract.  But, two of his \nmen being taken prisoners at the Orkney Islands, the Government \nbecame aware of his intention, and was able to act against him with \nsuch vigour as to prevent his raising more than two or three \nthousand Highlanders, although he sent a fiery cross, by trusty \nmessengers, from clan to clan and from glen to glen, as the custom \nthen was when those wild people were to be excited by their chiefs.  \nAs he was moving towards Glasgow with his small force, he was \nbetrayed by some of his followers, taken, and carried, with his \nhands tied behind his back, to his old prison in Edinburgh Castle.  \nJames ordered him to be executed, on his old shamefully unjust \nsentence, within three days; and he appears to have been anxious \nthat his legs should have been pounded with his old favourite the \nboot.  However, the boot was not applied; he was simply beheaded, \nand his head was set upon the top of Edinburgh Jail.  One of those \nEnglishmen who had been assigned to him was that old soldier \nRumbold, the master of the Rye House.  He was sorely wounded, and \nwithin a week after Argyle had suffered with great courage, was \nbrought up for trial, lest he should die and disappoint the King.  \nHe, too, was executed, after defending himself with great spirit, \nand saying that he did not believe that God had made the greater \npart of mankind to carry saddles on their backs and bridles in \ntheir mouths, and to be ridden by a few, booted and spurred for the \npurpose - in which I thoroughly agree with Rumbold.\n\nThe Duke of Monmouth, partly through being detained and partly \nthrough idling his time away, was five or six weeks behind his \nfriend when he landed at Lyme, in Dorset:  having at his right hand \nan unlucky nobleman called LORD GREY OF WERK, who of himself would \nhave ruined a far more promising expedition.  He immediately set up \nhis standard in the market-place, and proclaimed the King a tyrant, \nand a Popish usurper, and I know not what else; charging him, not \nonly with what he had done, which was bad enough, but with what \nneither he nor anybody else had done, such as setting fire to \nLondon, and poisoning the late King.  Raising some four thousand \nmen by these means, he marched on to Taunton, where there were many \nProtestant dissenters who were strongly opposed to the Catholics.  \nHere, both the rich and poor turned out to receive him, ladies \nwaved a welcome to him from all the windows as he passed along the \nstreets, flowers were strewn in his way, and every compliment and \nhonour that could be devised was showered upon him.  Among the \nrest, twenty young ladies came forward, in their best clothes, and \nin their brightest beauty, and gave him a Bible ornamented with \ntheir own fair hands, together with other presents.\n\nEncouraged by this homage, he proclaimed himself King, and went on \nto Bridgewater.  But, here the Government troops, under the EARL OF \nFEVERSHAM, were close at hand; and he was so dispirited at finding \nthat he made but few powerful friends after all, that it was a \nquestion whether he should disband his army and endeavour to \nescape.  It was resolved, at the instance of that unlucky Lord \nGrey, to make a night attack on the King\'s army, as it lay encamped \non the edge of a morass called Sedgemoor.  The horsemen were \ncommanded by the same unlucky lord, who was not a brave man.  He \ngave up the battle almost at the first obstacle - which was a deep \ndrain; and although the poor countrymen, who had turned out for \nMonmouth, fought bravely with scythes, poles, pitchforks, and such \npoor weapons as they had, they were soon dispersed by the trained \nsoldiers, and fled in all directions.  When the Duke of Monmouth \nhimself fled, was not known in the confusion; but the unlucky Lord \nGrey was taken early next day, and then another of the party was \ntaken, who confessed that he had parted from the Duke only four \nhours before.  Strict search being made, he was found disguised as \na peasant, hidden in a ditch under fern and nettles, with a few \npeas in his pocket which he had gathered in the fields to eat.  The \nonly other articles he had upon him were a few papers and little \nbooks:  one of the latter being a strange jumble, in his own \nwriting, of charms, songs, recipes, and prayers.  He was completely \nbroken.  He wrote a miserable letter to the King, beseeching and \nentreating to be allowed to see him.  When he was taken to London, \nand conveyed bound into the King\'s presence, he crawled to him on \nhis knees, and made a most degrading exhibition.  As James never \nforgave or relented towards anybody, he was not likely to soften \ntowards the issuer of the Lyme proclamation, so he told the \nsuppliant to prepare for death.\n\nOn the fifteenth of July, one thousand six hundred and eighty-five, \nthis unfortunate favourite of the people was brought out to die on \nTower Hill.  The crowd was immense, and the tops of all the houses \nwere covered with gazers.  He had seen his wife, the daughter of \nthe Duke of Buccleuch, in the Tower, and had talked much of a lady \nwhom he loved far better - the LADY HARRIET WENTWORTH - who was one \nof the last persons he remembered in this life.  Before laying down \nhis head upon the block he felt the edge of the axe, and told the \nexecutioner that he feared it was not sharp enough, and that the \naxe was not heavy enough.  On the executioner replying that it was \nof the proper kind, the Duke said, \'I pray you have a care, and do \nnot use me so awkwardly as you used my Lord Russell.\'  The \nexecutioner, made nervous by this, and trembling, struck once and \nmerely gashed him in the neck.  Upon this, the Duke of Monmouth \nraised his head and looked the man reproachfully in the face.  Then \nhe struck twice, and then thrice, and then threw down the axe, and \ncried out in a voice of horror that he could not finish that work.  \nThe sheriffs, however, threatening him with what should be done to \nhimself if he did not, he took it up again and struck a fourth time \nand a fifth time.  Then the wretched head at last fell off, and \nJames, Duke of Monmouth, was dead, in the thirty-sixth year of his \nage.  He was a showy, graceful man, with many popular qualities, \nand had found much favour in the open hearts of the English.\n\nThe atrocities, committed by the Government, which followed this \nMonmouth rebellion, form the blackest and most lamentable page in \nEnglish history.  The poor peasants, having been dispersed with \ngreat loss, and their leaders having been taken, one would think \nthat the implacable King might have been satisfied.  But no; he let \nloose upon them, among other intolerable monsters, a COLONEL KIRK, \nwho had served against the Moors, and whose soldiers - called by \nthe people Kirk\'s lambs, because they bore a lamb upon their flag, \nas the emblem of Christianity - were worthy of their leader.  The \natrocities committed by these demons in human shape are far too \nhorrible to be related here.  It is enough to say, that besides \nmost ruthlessly murdering and robbing them, and ruining them by \nmaking them buy their pardons at the price of all they possessed, \nit was one of Kirk\'s favourite amusements, as he and his officers \nsat drinking after dinner, and toasting the King, to have batches \nof prisoners hanged outside the windows for the company\'s \ndiversion; and that when their feet quivered in the convulsions of \ndeath, he used to swear that they should have music to their \ndancing, and would order the drums to beat and the trumpets to \nplay.  The detestable King informed him, as an acknowledgment of \nthese services, that he was \'very well satisfied with his \nproceedings.\'  But the King\'s great delight was in the proceedings \nof Jeffreys, now a peer, who went down into the west, with four \nother judges, to try persons accused of having had any share in the \nrebellion.  The King pleasantly called this \'Jeffreys\'s campaign.\'  \nThe people down in that part of the country remember it to this day \nas The Bloody Assize.\n\nIt began at Winchester, where a poor deaf old lady, MRS. ALICIA \nLISLE, the widow of one of the judges of Charles the First (who had \nbeen murdered abroad by some Royalist assassins), was charged with \nhaving given shelter in her house to two fugitives from Sedgemoor.  \nThree times the jury refused to find her guilty, until Jeffreys \nbullied and frightened them into that false verdict.  When he had \nextorted it from them, he said, \'Gentlemen, if I had been one of \nyou, and she had been my own mother, I would have found her \nguilty;\' - as I dare say he would.  He sentenced her to be burned \nalive, that very afternoon.  The clergy of the cathedral and some \nothers interfered in her favour, and she was beheaded within a \nweek.  As a high mark of his approbation, the King made Jeffreys \nLord Chancellor; and he then went on to Dorchester, to Exeter, to \nTaunton, and to Wells.  It is astonishing, when we read of the \nenormous injustice and barbarity of this beast, to know that no one \nstruck him dead on the judgment-seat.  It was enough for any man or \nwoman to be accused by an enemy, before Jeffreys, to be found \nguilty of high treason.  One man who pleaded not guilty, he ordered \nto be taken out of court upon the instant, and hanged; and this so \nterrified the prisoners in general that they mostly pleaded guilty \nat once.  At Dorchester alone, in the course of a few days, \nJeffreys hanged eighty people; besides whipping, transporting, \nimprisoning, and selling as slaves, great numbers.  He executed, in \nall, two hundred and fifty, or three hundred.\n\nThese executions took place, among the neighbours and friends of \nthe sentenced, in thirty-six towns and villages.  Their bodies were \nmangled, steeped in caldrons of boiling pitch and tar, and hung up \nby the roadsides, in the streets, over the very churches.  The \nsight and smell of heads and limbs, the hissing and bubbling of the \ninfernal caldrons, and the tears and terrors of the people, were \ndreadful beyond all description.  One rustic, who was forced to \nsteep the remains in the black pot, was ever afterwards called \'Tom \nBoilman.\'  The hangman has ever since been called Jack Ketch, \nbecause a man of that name went hanging and hanging, all day long, \nin the train of Jeffreys.  You will hear much of the horrors of the \ngreat French Revolution.  Many and terrible they were, there is no \ndoubt; but I know of nothing worse, done by the maddened people of \nFrance in that awful time, than was done by the highest judge in \nEngland, with the express approval of the King of England, in The \nBloody Assize.\n\nNor was even this all.  Jeffreys was as fond of money for himself \nas of misery for others, and he sold pardons wholesale to fill his \npockets.  The King ordered, at one time, a thousand prisoners to be \ngiven to certain of his favourites, in order that they might \nbargain with them for their pardons.  The young ladies of Taunton \nwho had presented the Bible, were bestowed upon the maids of honour \nat court; and those precious ladies made very hard bargains with \nthem indeed.  When The Bloody Assize was at its most dismal height, \nthe King was diverting himself with horse-races in the very place \nwhere Mrs. Lisle had been executed.  When Jeffreys had done his \nworst, and came home again, he was particularly complimented in the \nRoyal Gazette; and when the King heard that through drunkenness and \nraging he was very ill, his odious Majesty remarked that such \nanother man could not easily be found in England.  Besides all \nthis, a former sheriff of London, named CORNISH, was hanged within \nsight of his own house, after an abominably conducted trial, for \nhaving had a share in the Rye House Plot, on evidence given by \nRumsey, which that villain was obliged to confess was directly \nopposed to the evidence he had given on the trial of Lord Russell.  \nAnd on the very same day, a worthy widow, named ELIZABETH GAUNT, \nwas burned alive at Tyburn, for having sheltered a wretch who \nhimself gave evidence against her.  She settled the fuel about \nherself with her own hands, so that the flames should reach her \nquickly:  and nobly said, with her last breath, that she had obeyed \nthe sacred command of God, to give refuge to the outcast, and not \nto betray the wanderer.\n\nAfter all this hanging, beheading, burning, boiling, mutilating, \nexposing, robbing, transporting, and selling into slavery, of his \nunhappy subjects, the King not unnaturally thought that he could do \nwhatever he would.  So, he went to work to change the religion of \nthe country with all possible speed; and what he did was this.\n\nHe first of all tried to get rid of what was called the Test Act - \nwhich prevented the Catholics from holding public employments - by \nhis own power of dispensing with the penalties.  He tried it in one \ncase, and, eleven of the twelve judges deciding in his favour, he \nexercised it in three others, being those of three dignitaries of \nUniversity College, Oxford, who had become Papists, and whom he \nkept in their places and sanctioned.  He revived the hated \nEcclesiastical Commission, to get rid of COMPTON, Bishop of London, \nwho manfully opposed him.  He solicited the Pope to favour England \nwith an ambassador, which the Pope (who was a sensible man then) \nrather unwillingly did.  He flourished Father Petre before the eyes \nof the people on all possible occasions.  He favoured the \nestablishment of convents in several parts of London.  He was \ndelighted to have the streets, and even the court itself, filled \nwith Monks and Friars in the habits of their orders.  He constantly \nendeavoured to make Catholics of the Protestants about him.  He \nheld private interviews, which he called \'closetings,\' with those \nMembers of Parliament who held offices, to persuade them to consent \nto the design he had in view.  When they did not consent, they were \nremoved, or resigned of themselves, and their places were given to \nCatholics.  He displaced Protestant officers from the army, by \nevery means in his power, and got Catholics into their places too.  \nHe tried the same thing with the corporations, and also (though not \nso successfully) with the Lord Lieutenants of counties.  To terrify \nthe people into the endurance of all these measures, he kept an \narmy of fifteen thousand men encamped on Hounslow Heath, where mass \nwas openly performed in the General\'s tent, and where priests went \namong the soldiers endeavouring to persuade them to become \nCatholics.  For circulating a paper among those men advising them \nto be true to their religion, a Protestant clergyman, named \nJOHNSON, the chaplain of the late Lord Russell, was actually \nsentenced to stand three times in the pillory, and was actually \nwhipped from Newgate to Tyburn.  He dismissed his own brother-in-\nlaw from his Council because he was a Protestant, and made a Privy \nCouncillor of the before-mentioned Father Petre.  He handed Ireland \nover to RICHARD TALBOT, EARL OF TYRCONNELL, a worthless, dissolute \nknave, who played the same game there for his master, and who \nplayed the deeper game for himself of one day putting it under the \nprotection of the French King.  In going to these extremities, \nevery man of sense and judgment among the Catholics, from the Pope \nto a porter, knew that the King was a mere bigoted fool, who would \nundo himself and the cause he sought to advance; but he was deaf to \nall reason, and, happily for England ever afterwards, went tumbling \noff his throne in his own blind way.\n\nA spirit began to arise in the country, which the besotted \nblunderer little expected.  He first found it out in the University \nof Cambridge.  Having made a Catholic a dean at Oxford without any \nopposition, he tried to make a monk a master of arts at Cambridge:  \nwhich attempt the University resisted, and defeated him.  He then \nwent back to his favourite Oxford.  On the death of the President \nof Magdalen College, he commanded that there should be elected to \nsucceed him, one MR. ANTHONY FARMER, whose only recommendation was, \nthat he was of the King\'s religion.  The University plucked up \ncourage at last, and refused.  The King substituted another man, \nand it still refused, resolving to stand by its own election of a \nMR. HOUGH.  The dull tyrant, upon this, punished Mr. Hough, and \nfive-and-twenty more, by causing them to be expelled and declared \nincapable of holding any church preferment; then he proceeded to \nwhat he supposed to be his highest step, but to what was, in fact, \nhis last plunge head-foremost in his tumble off his throne.\n\nHe had issued a declaration that there should be no religious tests \nor penal laws, in order to let in the Catholics more easily; but \nthe Protestant dissenters, unmindful of themselves, had gallantly \njoined the regular church in opposing it tooth and nail.  The King \nand Father Petre now resolved to have this read, on a certain \nSunday, in all the churches, and to order it to be circulated for \nthat purpose by the bishops.  The latter took counsel with the \nArchbishop of Canterbury, who was in disgrace; and they resolved \nthat the declaration should not be read, and that they would \npetition the King against it.  The Archbishop himself wrote out the \npetition, and six bishops went into the King\'s bedchamber the same \nnight to present it, to his infinite astonishment.  Next day was \nthe Sunday fixed for the reading, and it was only read by two \nhundred clergymen out of ten thousand.  The King resolved against \nall advice to prosecute the bishops in the Court of King\'s Bench, \nand within three weeks they were summoned before the Privy Council, \nand committed to the Tower.  As the six bishops were taken to that \ndismal place, by water, the people who were assembled in immense \nnumbers fell upon their knees, and wept for them, and prayed for \nthem.  When they got to the Tower, the officers and soldiers on \nguard besought them for their blessing.  While they were confined \nthere, the soldiers every day drank to their release with loud \nshouts.  When they were brought up to the Court of King\'s Bench for \ntheir trial, which the Attorney-General said was for the high \noffence of censuring the Government, and giving their opinion about \naffairs of state, they were attended by similar multitudes, and \nsurrounded by a throng of noblemen and gentlemen.  When the jury \nwent out at seven o\'clock at night to consider of their verdict, \neverybody (except the King) knew that they would rather starve than \nyield to the King\'s brewer, who was one of them, and wanted a \nverdict for his customer.  When they came into court next morning, \nafter resisting the brewer all night, and gave a verdict of not \nguilty, such a shout rose up in Westminster Hall as it had never \nheard before; and it was passed on among the people away to Temple \nBar, and away again to the Tower.  It did not pass only to the \neast, but passed to the west too, until it reached the camp at \nHounslow, where the fifteen thousand soldiers took it up and echoed \nit.  And still, when the dull King, who was then with Lord \nFeversham, heard the mighty roar, asked in alarm what it was, and \nwas told that it was \'nothing but the acquittal of the bishops,\' he \nsaid, in his dogged way, \'Call you that nothing?  It is so much the \nworse for them.\'\n\nBetween the petition and the trial, the Queen had given birth to a \nson, which Father Petre rather thought was owing to Saint Winifred.  \nBut I doubt if Saint Winifred had much to do with it as the King\'s \nfriend, inasmuch as the entirely new prospect of a Catholic \nsuccessor (for both the King\'s daughters were Protestants) \ndetermined the EARLS OF SHREWSBURY, DANBY, and DEVONSHIRE, LORD \nLUMLEY, the BISHOP OF LONDON, ADMIRAL RUSSELL, and COLONEL SIDNEY, \nto invite the Prince of Orange over to England.  The Royal Mole, \nseeing his danger at last, made, in his fright, many great \nconcessions, besides raising an army of forty thousand men; but the \nPrince of Orange was not a man for James the Second to cope with.  \nHis preparations were extraordinarily vigorous, and his mind was \nresolved.\n\nFor a fortnight after the Prince was ready to sail for England, a \ngreat wind from the west prevented the departure of his fleet.  \nEven when the wind lulled, and it did sail, it was dispersed by a \nstorm, and was obliged to put back to refit.  At last, on the first \nof November, one thousand six hundred and eighty-eight, the \nProtestant east wind, as it was long called, began to blow; and on \nthe third, the people of Dover and the people of Calais saw a fleet \ntwenty miles long sailing gallantly by, between the two places.  On \nMonday, the fifth, it anchored at Torbay in Devonshire, and the \nPrince, with a splendid retinue of officers and men, marched into \nExeter.  But the people in that western part of the country had \nsuffered so much in The Bloody Assize, that they had lost heart.  \nFew people joined him; and he began to think of returning, and \npublishing the invitation he had received from those lords, as his \njustification for having come at all.  At this crisis, some of the \ngentry joined him; the Royal army began to falter; an engagement \nwas signed, by which all who set their hand to it declared that \nthey would support one another in defence of the laws and liberties \nof the three Kingdoms, of the Protestant religion, and of the \nPrince of Orange.  From that time, the cause received no check; the \ngreatest towns in England began, one after another, to declare for \nthe Prince; and he knew that it was all safe with him when the \nUniversity of Oxford offered to melt down its plate, if he wanted \nany money.\n\nBy this time the King was running about in a pitiable way, touching \npeople for the King\'s evil in one place, reviewing his troops in \nanother, and bleeding from the nose in a third.  The young Prince \nwas sent to Portsmouth, Father Petre went off like a shot to \nFrance, and there was a general and swift dispersal of all the \npriests and friars.  One after another, the King\'s most important \nofficers and friends deserted him and went over to the Prince.  In \nthe night, his daughter Anne fled from Whitehall Palace; and the \nBishop of London, who had once been a soldier, rode before her with \na drawn sword in his hand, and pistols at his saddle.  \'God help \nme,\' cried the miserable King:  \'my very children have forsaken \nme!\'  In his wildness, after debating with such lords as were in \nLondon, whether he should or should not call a Parliament, and \nafter naming three of them to negotiate with the Prince, he \nresolved to fly to France.  He had the little Prince of Wales \nbrought back from Portsmouth; and the child and the Queen crossed \nthe river to Lambeth in an open boat, on a miserable wet night, and \ngot safely away.  This was on the night of the ninth of December.\n\nAt one o\'clock on the morning of the eleventh, the King, who had, \nin the meantime, received a letter from the Prince of Orange, \nstating his objects, got out of bed, told LORD NORTHUMBERLAND who \nlay in his room not to open the door until the usual hour in the \nmorning, and went down the back stairs (the same, I suppose, by \nwhich the priest in the wig and gown had come up to his brother) \nand crossed the river in a small boat:  sinking the great seal of \nEngland by the way.  Horses having been provided, he rode, \naccompanied by SIR EDWARD HALES, to Feversham, where he embarked in \na Custom House Hoy.  The master of this Hoy, wanting more ballast, \nran into the Isle of Sheppy to get it, where the fishermen and \nsmugglers crowded about the boat, and informed the King of their \nsuspicions that he was a \'hatchet-faced Jesuit.\'  As they took his \nmoney and would not let him go, he told them who he was, and that \nthe Prince of Orange wanted to take his life; and he began to \nscream for a boat - and then to cry, because he had lost a piece of \nwood on his ride which he called a fragment of Our Saviour\'s cross.  \nHe put himself into the hands of the Lord Lieutenant of the county, \nand his detention was made known to the Prince of Orange at Windsor \n- who, only wanting to get rid of him, and not caring where he \nwent, so that he went away, was very much disconcerted that they \ndid not let him go.  However, there was nothing for it but to have \nhim brought back, with some state in the way of Life Guards, to \nWhitehall.  And as soon as he got there, in his infatuation, he \nheard mass, and set a Jesuit to say grace at his public dinner.\n\nThe people had been thrown into the strangest state of confusion by \nhis flight, and had taken it into their heads that the Irish part \nof the army were going to murder the Protestants.  Therefore, they \nset the bells a ringing, and lighted watch-fires, and burned \nCatholic Chapels, and looked about in all directions for Father \nPetre and the Jesuits, while the Pope\'s ambassador was running away \nin the dress of a footman.  They found no Jesuits; but a man, who \nhad once been a frightened witness before Jeffreys in court, saw a \nswollen, drunken face looking through a window down at Wapping, \nwhich he well remembered.  The face was in a sailor\'s dress, but he \nknew it to be the face of that accursed judge, and he seized him.  \nThe people, to their lasting honour, did not tear him to pieces.  \nAfter knocking him about a little, they took him, in the basest \nagonies of terror, to the Lord Mayor, who sent him, at his own \nshrieking petition, to the Tower for safety.  There, he died.\n\nTheir bewilderment continuing, the people now lighted bonfires and \nmade rejoicings, as if they had any reason to be glad to have the \nKing back again.  But, his stay was very short, for the English \nguards were removed from Whitehall, Dutch guards were marched up to \nit, and he was told by one of his late ministers that the Prince \nwould enter London, next day, and he had better go to Ham.  He \nsaid, Ham was a cold, damp place, and he would rather go to \nRochester.  He thought himself very cunning in this, as he meant to \nescape from Rochester to France.  The Prince of Orange and his \nfriends knew that, perfectly well, and desired nothing more.  So, \nhe went to Gravesend, in his royal barge, attended by certain \nlords, and watched by Dutch troops, and pitied by the generous \npeople, who were far more forgiving than he had ever been, when \nthey saw him in his humiliation.  On the night of the twenty-third \nof December, not even then understanding that everybody wanted to \nget rid of him, he went out, absurdly, through his Rochester \ngarden, down to the Medway, and got away to France, where he \nrejoined the Queen.\n\nThere had been a council in his absence, of the lords, and the \nauthorities of London.  When the Prince came, on the day after the \nKing\'s departure, he summoned the Lords to meet him, and soon \nafterwards, all those who had served in any of the Parliaments of \nKing Charles the Second.  It was finally resolved by these \nauthorities that the throne was vacant by the conduct of King James \nthe Second; that it was inconsistent with the safety and welfare of \nthis Protestant kingdom, to be governed by a Popish prince; that \nthe Prince and Princess of Orange should be King and Queen during \ntheir lives and the life of the survivor of them; and that their \nchildren should succeed them, if they had any.  That if they had \nnone, the Princess Anne and her children should succeed; that if \nshe had none, the heirs of the Prince of Orange should succeed.\n\nOn the thirteenth of January, one thousand six hundred and eighty-\nnine, the Prince and Princess, sitting on a throne in Whitehall, \nbound themselves to these conditions.  The Protestant religion was \nestablished in England, and England\'s great and glorious Revolution \nwas complete.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\n\nI HAVE now arrived at the close of my little history.  The events \nwhich succeeded the famous Revolution of one thousand six hundred \nand eighty-eight, would neither be easily related nor easily \nunderstood in such a book as this.\n\nWilliam and Mary reigned together, five years.  After the death of \nhis good wife, William occupied the throne, alone, for seven years \nlonger.  During his reign, on the sixteenth of September, one \nthousand seven hundred and one, the poor weak creature who had once \nbeen James the Second of England, died in France.  In the meantime \nhe had done his utmost (which was not much) to cause William to be \nassassinated, and to regain his lost dominions.  James\'s son was \ndeclared, by the French King, the rightful King of England; and was \ncalled in France THE CHEVALIER SAINT GEORGE, and in England THE \nPRETENDER.  Some infatuated people in England, and particularly in \nScotland, took up the Pretender\'s cause from time to time - as if \nthe country had not had Stuarts enough! - and many lives were \nsacrificed, and much misery was occasioned.  King William died on \nSunday, the seventh of March, one thousand seven hundred and two, \nof the consequences of an accident occasioned by his horse \nstumbling with him.  He was always a brave, patriotic Prince, and a \nman of remarkable abilities.  His manner was cold, and he made but \nfew friends; but he had truly loved his queen.  When he was dead, a \nlock of her hair, in a ring, was found tied with a black ribbon \nround his left arm.\n\nHe was succeeded by the PRINCESS ANNE, a popular Queen, who reigned \ntwelve years.  In her reign, in the month of May, one thousand \nseven hundred and seven, the Union between England and Scotland was \neffected, and the two countries were incorporated under the name of \nGREAT BRITAIN.  Then, from the year one thousand seven hundred and \nfourteen to the year one thousand, eight hundred and thirty, \nreigned the four GEORGES.\n\nIt was in the reign of George the Second, one thousand seven \nhundred and forty-five, that the Pretender did his last mischief, \nand made his last appearance.  Being an old man by that time, he \nand the Jacobites - as his friends were called - put forward his \nson, CHARLES EDWARD, known as the young Chevalier.  The Highlanders \nof Scotland, an extremely troublesome and wrong-headed race on the \nsubject of the Stuarts, espoused his cause, and he joined them, and \nthere was a Scottish rebellion to make him king, in which many \ngallant and devoted gentlemen lost their lives.  It was a hard \nmatter for Charles Edward to escape abroad again, with a high price \non his head; but the Scottish people were extraordinarily faithful \nto him, and, after undergoing many romantic adventures, not unlike \nthose of Charles the Second, he escaped to France.  A number of \ncharming stories and delightful songs arose out of the Jacobite \nfeelings, and belong to the Jacobite times.  Otherwise I think the \nStuarts were a public nuisance altogether.\n\nIt was in the reign of George the Third that England lost North \nAmerica, by persisting in taxing her without her own consent.  That \nimmense country, made independent under WASHINGTON, and left to \nitself, became the United States; one of the greatest nations of \nthe earth.  In these times in which I write, it is honourably \nremarkable for protecting its subjects, wherever they may travel, \nwith a dignity and a determination which is a model for England.  \nBetween you and me, England has rather lost ground in this respect \nsince the days of Oliver Cromwell.\n\nThe Union of Great Britain with Ireland - which had been getting on \nvery ill by itself - took place in the reign of George the Third, \non the second of July, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight.\n\nWILLIAM THE FOURTH succeeded George the Fourth, in the year one \nthousand eight hundred and thirty, and reigned seven years.  QUEEN \nVICTORIA, his niece, the only child of the Duke of Kent, the fourth \nson of George the Third, came to the throne on the twentieth of \nJune, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-seven.  She was married \nto PRINCE ALBERT of Saxe Gotha on the tenth of February, one \nthousand eight hundred and forty.  She is very good, and much \nbeloved.  So I end, like the crier, with\n\nGOD SAVE THE QUEEN!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg eText A Child\'s History of England\n\nProject Gutenberg Etext of Contributions to:  All The Year Round \n#48 in our series by Charles Dickens\n\n\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check\nthe copyright laws for your country before posting these files!!\n\nPlease take a look at the important information in this header.\nWe encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an\nelectronic path open for the next readers.

The\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\nfiles per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.

In some\nimportant respects, I am now free greatly to advance on past\narrangements.  Those, I leave to testify for themselves in due\ncourse.\n\n\"That fusion of the graces of the imagination with the realities of\nlife, which is vital to the welfare of any community, and for which\nI have striven from week to week as honestly as I could during the\nlast nine years, will continue to be striven for \"all the year\nround\".  The old weekly cares and duties become things of the Past,\nmerely to be assumed, with an increased love for them and brighter\nhopes springing out of them, in the Present and the Future.\n\n\"I look, and plan, for a very much wider circle of readers, and yet\nagain for a steadily expanding circle of readers, in the projects I\nhope to carry through \"all the year round\".  And I feel confident\nthat this expectation will be realized, if it deserve realization.\n\n\"The task of my new journal is set, and it will steadily try to work\nthe task out.  Its pages shall show to what good purpose their motto\nis remembered in them, and with how much of fidelity and earnestness\nthey tell\n\n\"the story of our lives from year to year.\n\n\"CHARLES DICKENS.\"\n\n\nSince this was issued, the Journal itself has come into existence,\nand has spoken for itself five weeks.  Its fifth Number is published\nto-day, and its circulation, moderately stated, trebles that now\nrelinquished in Household Words.\n\nIn referring our readers, henceforth, to All the Year Round, we can\nbut assure them afresh, of our unwearying and faithful service, in\nwhat is at once the work and the chief pleasure of our life.\nThrough all that we are doing, and through all that we design to do,\nour aim is to do our best in sincerity of purpose, and true devotion\nof spirit.\n\nWe do not for a moment suppose that we may lean on the character of\nthese pages, and rest contented at the point where they stop.  We\nsee in that point but a starting-place for our new journey; and on\nthat journey, with new prospects opening out before us everywhere,\nwe joyfully proceed, entreating our readers--without any of the pain\nof leave-taking incidental to most journeys--to bear us company All\nthe year round.\n\nSaturday, May 28, 1859.\n\n\n\nTHE POOR MAN AND HIS BEER\n\n\n\nMy friend Philosewers and I, contemplating a farm-labourer the other\nday, who was drinking his mug of beer on a settle at a roadside ale-\nhouse door, we fell to humming the fag-end of an old ditty, of which\nthe poor man and his beer, and the sin of parting them, form the\ndoleful burden.  Philosewers then mentioned to me that a friend of\nhis in an agricultural county--say a Hertfordshire friend--had, for\ntwo years last past, endeavoured to reconcile the poor man and his\nbeer to public morality, by making it a point of honour between\nhimself and the poor man that the latter should use his beer and not\nabuse it.  Interested in an effort of so unobtrusive and\nunspeechifying a nature, \"O Philosewers,\" said I, after the manner\nof the dreary sages in Eastern apologues, \"Show me, I pray, the man\nwho deems that temperance can be attained without a medal, an\noration, a banner, and a denunciation of half the world, and who has\nat once the head and heart to set about it!\"\n\nPhilosewers expressing, in reply, his willingness to gratify the\ndreary sage, an appointment was made for the purpose.  And on the\nday fixed, I, the Dreary one, accompanied by Philosewers, went down\nNor\'-West per railway, in search of temperate temperance.  It was a\nthunderous day; and the clouds were so immoderately watery, and so\nvery much disposed to sour all the beer in Hertfordshire, that they\nseemed to have taken the pledge.\n\nBut, the sun burst forth gaily in the afternoon, and gilded the old\ngables, and old mullioned windows, and old weathercock and old\nclock-face, of the quaint old house which is the dwelling of the man\nwe sought.  How shall I describe him?  As one of the most famous\npractical chemists of the age?  That designation will do as well as\nanother--better, perhaps, than most others.  And his name?  Friar\nBacon.\n\n\"Though, take notice, Philosewers,\" said I, behind my hand, \"that\nthe first Friar Bacon had not that handsome lady-wife beside him.\nWherein, O Philosewers, he was a chemist, wretched and forlorn,\ncompared with his successor.  Young Romeo bade the holy father\nLawrence hang up philosophy, unless philosophy could make a Juliet.\nChemistry would infallibly be hanged if its life were staked on\nmaking anything half so pleasant as this Juliet.\"  The gentle\nPhilosewers smiled assent.\n\nThe foregoing whisper from myself, the Dreary one, tickled the ear\nof Philosewers, as we walked on the trim garden terrace before\ndinner, among the early leaves and blossoms; two peacocks,\napparently in very tight new boots, occasionally crossing the gravel\nat a distance.  The sun, shining through the old house-windows, now\nand then flashed out some brilliant piece of colour from bright\nhangings within, or upon the old oak panelling; similarly, Friar\nBacon, as we paced to and fro, revealed little glimpses of his good\nwork.\n\n\"It is not much,\" said he.  \"It is no wonderful thing.  There used\nto be a great deal of drunkenness here, and I wanted to make it\nbetter if I could.  The people are very ignorant, and have been much\nneglected, and I wanted to make THAT better, if I could.  My utmost\nobject was, to help them to a little self-government and a little\nhomely pleasure.  I only show the way to better things, and advise\nthem.  I never act for them; I never interfere; above all, I never\npatronise.\"\n\nI had said to Philosewers as we came along Nor\'-West that patronage\nwas one of the curses of England; I appeared to rise in the\nestimation of Philosewers when thus confirmed.\n\n\"And so,\" said Friar Bacon, \"I established my Allotment-club, and my\npig-clubs, and those little Concerts by the ladies of my own family,\nof which we have the last of the season this evening.  They are a\ngreat success, for the people here are amazingly fond of music.  But\nthere is the early dinner-bell, and I have no need to talk of my\nendeavours when you will soon see them in their working dress\".\n\nDinner done, behold the Friar, Philosewers, and myself the Dreary\none, walking, at six o\'clock, across the fields, to the \"Club-\nhouse.\"\n\nAs we swung open the last field-gate and entered the Allotment-\ngrounds, many members were already on their way to the Club, which\nstands in the midst of the allotments.  Who could help thinking of\nthe wonderful contrast between these club-men and the club-men of\nSt. James\'s Street, or Pall Mall, in London!  Look at yonder\nprematurely old man, doubled up with work, and leaning on a rude\nstick more crooked than himself, slowly trudging to the club-house,\nin a shapeless hat like an Italian harlequin\'s, or an old brown-\npaper bag, leathern leggings, and dull green smock-frock, looking as\nthough duck-weed had accumulated on it--the result of its stagnant\nlife--or as if it were a vegetable production, originally meant to\nblow into something better, but stopped somehow.  Compare him with\nOld Cousin Feenix, ambling along St. James\'s Street, got up in the\nstyle of a couple of generations ago, and with a head of hair, a\ncomplexion, and a set of teeth, profoundly impossible to be believed\nin by the widest stretch of human credulity.  Can they both be men\nand brothers?  Verily they are.  And although Cousin Feenix has\nlived so fast that he will die at Baden-Baden, and although this\nclub-man in the frock has lived, ever since he came to man\'s estate,\non nine shillings a week, and is sure to die in the Union if he die\nin bed, yet he brought as much into the world as Cousin Feenix, and\nwill take as much out--more, for more of him is real.\n\nA pretty, simple building, the club-house, with a rustic colonnade\noutside, under which the members can sit on wet evenings, looking at\nthe patches of ground they cultivate for themselves; within, a well-\nventilated room, large and lofty, cheerful pavement of coloured\ntiles, a bar for serving out the beer, good supply of forms and\nchairs, and a brave big chimney-corner, where the fire burns\ncheerfully.  Adjoining this room, another:\n\n\"Built for a reading-room,\" said Friar Bacon; \"but not much used--\nyet.\"\n\nThe dreary sage, looking in through the window, perceiving a fixed\nreading-desk within, and inquiring its use:\n\n\"I have Service there,\" said Friar Bacon.  \"They never went anywhere\nto hear prayers, and of course it would be hopeless to help them to\nbe happier and better, if they had no religious feeling at all.\"\n\n\"The whole place is very pretty.\"  Thus the sage.\n\n\"I am glad you think so.  I built it for the holders of the\nAllotment-grounds, and gave it them:  only requiring them to manage\nit by a committee of their own appointing, and never to get drunk\nthere.  They never have got drunk there.\"\n\n\"Yet they have their beer freely?\"\n\n\"O yes.  As much as they choose to buy.  The club gets its beer\ndirect from the brewer, by the barrel.  So they get it good; at once\nmuch cheaper, and much better, than at the public-house.  The\nmembers take it in turns to be steward, and serve out the beer:  if\na man should decline to serve when his turn came, he would pay a\nfine of twopence.  The steward lasts, as long as the barrel lasts.\nWhen there is a new barrel, there is a new steward.\"\n\n\"What a noble fire is roaring up that chimney!\"\n\n\"Yes, a capital fire.  Every member pays a halfpenny a week.\"\n\n\"Every member must be the holder of an Allotment-garden?\"\n\n\"Yes; for which he pays five shillings a year.  The Allotments you\nsee about us, occupy some sixteen or eighteen acres, and each garden\nis as large as experience shows one man to be able to manage.  You\nsee how admirably they are tilled, and how much they get off them.\nThey are always working in them in their spare hours; and when a man\nwants a mug of beer, instead of going off to the village and the\npublic-house, he puts down his spade or his hoe, comes to the club-\nhouse and gets it, and goes back to his work.  When he has done\nwork, he likes to have his beer at the club, still, and to sit and\nlook at his little crops as they thrive.\"\n\n\"They seem to manage the club very well.\"\n\n\"Perfectly well.  Here are their own rules.  They made them.  I\nnever interfere with them, except to advise them when they ask me.\"\n\n\nRULES AND REGULATIONS\nMADE BY THE COMMITTEE\nFrom the 21st September, 1857\n\nOne half-penny per week to be paid to the club by each member\n\n1.--Each member to draw the beer in order, according to the number\nof his allotment; on failing, a forfeit of twopence to be paid to\nthe club.\n\n2.--The member that draws the beer to pay for the same, and bring\nhis ticket up receipted when the subscriptions are paid; on failing\nto do so, a penalty of sixpence to be forfeited and paid to the\nclub.\n\n3.--The subscriptions and forfeits to be paid at the club-room on\nthe last Saturday night of each month.\n\n4.--The subscriptions and forfeits to be cleared up every quarter;\nif not, a penalty of sixpence to be paid to the club.\n\n5.--The member that draws the beer to be at the club-room by six\no\'clock every evening, and stay till ten; but in the event of no\nmember being there, he may leave at nine; on failing so to attend, a\npenalty of sixpence to be paid to the club.\n\n6.--Any member giving beer to a stranger in this club-room,\nexcepting to his wife or family, shall be liable to the penalty of\none shilling.\n\n7.--Any member lifting his hand to strike another in this club-room\nshall be liable to the penalty of sixpence.\n\n8.--Any member swearing in this club-room shall be liable to a\npenalty of twopence each time.\n\n9.--Any member selling beer shall be expelled from the club.\n\n10.--Any member wishing to give up his allotment, may apply to the\ncommittee, and they shall value the crop and the condition of the\nground.  The amount of the valuation shall be paid by the succeeding\ntenant, who shall be allowed to enter on any part of the allotment\nwhich is uncropped at the time of notice of the leaving tenant.\n\n11.--Any member not keeping his allotment-garden clear from seed-\nweeds, or otherwise injuring his neighbours, may be turned out of\nhis garden by the votes of two-thirds of the committee, one month\'s\nnotice being given to him.\n\n12.--Any member carelessly breaking a mug, is to pay the cost of\nreplacing the same.\n\n\nI was soliciting the attention of Philosewers to some old old\nbonnets hanging in the Allotment-gardens to frighten the birds, and\nthe fashion of which I should think would terrify a French bird to\ndeath at any distance, when Philosewers solicited my attention to\nthe scrapers at the club-house door.  The amount of the soil of\nEngland which every member brought there on his feet, was indeed\nsurprising; and even I, who am professedly a salad-eater, could have\ngrown a salad for my dinner, in the earth on any member\'s frock or\nhat.\n\n\"Now,\" said Friar Bacon, looking at his watch, \"for the Pig-clubs!\"\n\nThe dreary Sage entreated explanation.\n\n\"Why, a pig is so very valuable to a poor labouring man, and it is\nso very difficult for him at this time of the year to get money\nenough to buy one, that I lend him a pound for the purpose.  But, I\ndo it in this way.  I leave such of the club members as choose it\nand desire it, to form themselves into parties of five.  To every\nman in each company of five, I lend a pound, to buy a pig.  But,\neach man of the five becomes bound for every other man, as to the\nrepayment of his money.  Consequently, they look after one another,\nand pick out their partners with care; selecting men in whom they\nhave confidence.\"\n\n\"They repay the money, I suppose, when the pig is fattened, killed,\nand sold?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Then they repay the money.  And they do repay it.  I had one\nman, last year, who was a little tardy (he was in the habit of going\nto the public-house); but even he did pay.  It is an immense\nAdvantage to one of these poor fellows to have a pig.  The pig\nconsumes the refuse from the man\'s cottage and allotment-garden, and\nthe pig\'s refuse enriches the man\'s garden besides.  The pig is the\npoor man\'s friend.  Come into the club-house again.\"\n\nThe poor man\'s friend.  Yes.  I have often wondered who really was\nthe poor man\'s friend among a great number of competitors, and I now\nclearly perceive him to be the pig.  HE never makes any flourishes\nabout the poor man.  HE never gammons the poor man--except to his\nmanifest advantage in the article of bacon.  HE never comes down to\nthis house, or goes down to his constituents.  He openly declares to\nthe poor man, \"I want my sty because I am a Pig.  I desire to have\nas much to eat as you can by any means stuff me with, because I am a\nPig.\"  HE never gives the poor man a sovereign for bringing up a\nfamily.  HE never grunts the poor man\'s name in vain.  And when he\ndies in the odour of Porkity, he cuts up, a highly useful creature\nand a blessing to the poor man, from the ring in his snout to the\ncurl in his tail.  Which of the poor man\'s other friends can say as\nmuch?  Where is the M.P. who means Mere Pork?\n\nThe dreary Sage had glided into these reflections, when he found\nhimself sitting by the club-house fire, surrounded by green smock-\nfrocks and shapeless hats:  with Friar Bacon lively, busy, and\nexpert, at a little table near him.\n\n\"Now, then, come.  The first five!\" said Friar Bacon.  \"Where are\nyou?\"\n\n\"Order!\" cried a merry-faced little man, who had brought his young\ndaughter with him to see life, and who always modestly hid his face\nin his beer-mug after he had thus assisted the business.\n\n\"John Nightingale, William Thrush, Joseph Blackbird, Cecil Robin,\nand Thomas Linnet!\" cried Friar Bacon.\n\n\"Here, sir!\" and \"Here, sir!\"  And Linnet, Robin, Blackbird, Thrush,\nand Nightingale, stood confessed.\n\nWe, the undersigned, declare, in effect, by this written paper, that\neach of us is responsible for the repayment of this pig-money by\neach of the other.  \"Sure you understand, Nightingale?\"\n\n\"Ees, sur.\"\n\n\"Can you write your name, Nightingale?\"\n\n\"Na, sur.\"\n\nNightingale\'s eye upon his name, as Friar Bacon wrote it, was a\nsight to consider in after years.  Rather incredulous was\nNightingale, with a hand at the corner of his mouth, and his head on\none side, as to those drawings really meaning him.  Doubtful was\nNightingale whether any virtue had gone out of him in that committal\nto paper.  Meditative was Nightingale as to what would come of young\nNightingale\'s growing up to the acquisition of that art.  Suspended\nwas the interest of Nightingale, when his name was done--as if he\nthought the letters were only sown, to come up presently in some\nother form.  Prodigious, and wrong-handed was the cross made by\nNightingale on much encouragement--the strokes directed from him\ninstead of towards him; and most patient and sweet-humoured was the\nsmile of Nightingale as he stepped back into a general laugh.\n\n\"Order!\" cried the little man.  Immediately disappearing into his\nmug.\n\n\"Ralph Mangel, Roger Wurzel, Edward Vetches, Matthew Carrot, and\nCharles Taters!\" said Friar Bacon.\n\n\"All here, sir.\"\n\n\"You understand it, Mangel?\"\n\n\"Iss, sir, I unnerstaans it.\"\n\n\"Can you write your name, Mangel?\"\n\n\"Iss, sir.\"\n\nBreathless interest.  A dense background of smock-frocks accumulated\nbehind Mangel, and many eyes in it looked doubtfully at Friar Bacon,\nas who should say, \"Can he really though?\"  Mangel put down his hat,\nretired a little to get a good look at the paper, wetted his right\nhand thoroughly by drawing it slowly across his mouth, approached\nthe paper with great determination, flattened it, sat down at it,\nand got well to his work.  Circuitous and sea-serpent-like, were the\nmovements of the tongue of Mangel while he formed the letters;\nelevated were the eyebrows of Mangel and sidelong the eyes, as, with\nhis left whisker reposing on his left arm, they followed his\nperformance; many were the misgivings of Mangel, and slow was his\nretrospective meditation touching the junction of the letter p with\nh; something too active was the big forefinger of Mangel in its\npropensity to rub out without proved cause.  At last, long and deep\nwas the breath drawn by Mangel when he laid down the pen; long and\ndeep the wondering breath drawn by the background--as if they had\nwatched his walking across the rapids of Niagara, on stilts, and now\ncried, \"He has done it!\"\n\nBut, Mangel was an honest man, if ever honest man lived.  \"T\'owt to\nbe a hell, sir,\" said he, contemplating his work, \"and I ha\' made a\nt on \'t.\"\n\nThe over-fraught bosoms of the background found relief in a roar of\nlaughter.\n\n\"OR-DER!\" cried the little man.  \"CHEER!\"  And after that second\nword, came forth from his mug no more.\n\nSeveral other clubs signed, and received their money.  Very few\ncould write their names; all who could not, pleaded that they could\nnot, more or less sorrowfully, and always with a shake of the head,\nand in a lower voice than their natural speaking voice.  Crosses\ncould be made standing; signatures must be sat down to.  There was\nno exception to this rule.  Meantime, the various club-members\nsmoked, drank their beer, and talked together quite unrestrained.\nThey all wore their hats, except when they went up to Friar Bacon\'s\ntable.  The merry-faced little man offered his beer, with a natural\ngood-fellowship, both to the Dreary one and Philosewers.  Both\npartook of it with thanks.\n\n\"Seven o\'clock!\" said Friar Bacon.  \"And now we better get across to\nthe concert, men, for the music will be beginning.\"\n\nThe concert was in Friar Bacon\'s laboratory; a large building near\nat hand, in an open field.  The bettermost people of the village and\nneighbourhood were in a gallery on one side, and, in a gallery\nopposite the orchestra.  The whole space below was filled with the\nlabouring people and their families, to the number of five or six\nhundred.  We had been obliged to turn away two hundred to-night,\nFriar Bacon said, for want of room--and that, not counting the boys,\nof whom we had taken in only a few picked ones, by reason of the\nboys, as a class, being given to too fervent a custom of applauding\nwith their boot-heels.\n\nThe performers were the ladies of Friar Bacon\'s family, and two\ngentlemen; one of them, who presided, a Doctor of Music.  A piano\nwas the only instrument.  Among the vocal pieces, we had a negro\nmelody (rapturously encored), the Indian Drum, and the Village\nBlacksmith; neither did we want for fashionable Italian, having Ah!\nnon giunge, and Mi manca la voce.  Our success was splendid; our\ngood-humoured, unaffected, and modest bearing, a pattern.  As to the\naudience, they were far more polite and far more pleased than at the\nOpera; they were faultless.  Thus for barely an hour the concert\nlasted, with thousands of great bottles looking on from the walls,\ncontaining the results of Friar Bacon\'s Million and one experiments\nin agricultural chemistry; and containing too, no doubt, a variety\nof materials with which the Friar could have blown us all through\nthe roof at five minutes\' notice.\n\nGod save the Queen being done, the good Friar stepped forward and\nsaid a few words, more particularly concerning two points; firstly,\nthat Saturday half-holiday, which it would be kind in farmers to\ngrant; secondly, the additional Allotment-grounds we were going to\nestablish, in consequence of the happy success of the system, but\nwhich we could not guarantee should entitle the holders to be\nmembers of the club, because the present members must consider and\nsettle that question for themselves:  a bargain between man and man\nbeing always a bargain, and we having made over the club to them as\nthe original Allotment-men.  This was loudly applauded, and so, with\ncontented and affectionate cheering, it was all over.\n\nAs Philosewers, and I the Dreary, posted back to London, looking up\nat the moon and discussing it as a world preparing for the\nhabitation of responsible creatures, we expatiated on the honour due\nto men in this world of ours who try to prepare it for a higher\ncourse, and to leave the race who live and die upon it better than\nthey found them.\n\n\n\nFIVE NEW POINTS OF CRIMINAL LAW\n\n\n\nThe existing Criminal Law has been found in trials for Murder, to be\nso exceedingly hasty, unfair, and oppressive--in a word, to be so\nvery objectionable to the amiable persons accused of that\nthoughtless act--that it is, we understand, the intention of the\nGovernment to bring in a Bill for its amendment.  We have been\nfavoured with an outline of its probable provisions.\n\nIt will be grounded on the profound principle that the real offender\nis the Murdered Person; but for whose obstinate persistency in being\nmurdered, the interesting fellow-creature to be tried could not have\ngot into trouble.\n\nIts leading enactments may be expected to resolve themselves under\nthe following heads:\n\n1.  There shall be no judge.  Strong representations have been made\nby highly popular culprits that the presence of this obtrusive\ncharacter is prejudicial to their best interests.  The Court will be\ncomposed of a political gentleman, sitting in a secluded room\ncommanding a view of St. James\'s Park, who has already more to do\nthan any human creature can, by any stretch of the human\nimagination, be supposed capable of doing.\n\n2.  The jury to consist of Five Thousand Five Hundred and Fifty-five\nVolunteers.\n\n3.  The jury to be strictly prohibited from seeing either the\naccused or the witnesses.  They are not to be sworn.  They are on no\naccount to hear the evidence.  They are to receive it, or such\nrepresentations of it, as may happen to fall in their way; and they\nwill constantly write letters about it to all the Papers.\n\n4.  Supposing the trial to be a trial for Murder by poisoning, and\nsupposing the hypothetical case, or the evidence, for the\nprosecution to charge the administration of two poisons, say Arsenic\nand Antimony; and supposing the taint of Arsenic in the body to be\npossible but not probable, and the presence of Antimony in the body,\nto be an absolute certainty; it will then become the duty of the\njury to confine their attention solely to the Arsenic, and entirely\nto dismiss the Antimony from their minds.\n\n5.  The symptoms preceding the death of the real offender (or\nMurdered Person) being described in evidence by medical\npractitioners who saw them, other medical practitioners who never\nsaw them shall be required to state whether they are inconsistent\nwith certain known diseases--but, THEY SHALL NEVER BE ASKED WHETHER\nTHEY ARE NOT EXACTLY CONSISTENT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF POISON.\nTo illustrate this enactment in the proposed Bill by a case:- A\nraging mad dog is seen to run into the house where Z lives alone,\nfoaming at the mouth.  Z and the mad dog are for some time left\ntogether in that house under proved circumstances, irresistibly\nleading to the conclusion that Z has been bitten by the dog.  Z is\nafterwards found lying on his bed in a state of hydrophobia, and\nwith the marks of the dog\'s teeth.  Now, the symptoms of that\ndisease being identical with those of another disease called\nTetanus, which might supervene on Z\'s running a rusty nail into a\ncertain part of his foot, medical practitioners who never saw Z,\nshall bear testimony to that abstract fact, and it shall then be\nincumbent on the Registrar-General to certify that Z died of a rusty\nnail.\n\nIt is hoped that these alterations in the present mode of procedure\nwill not only be quite satisfactory to the accused person (which is\nthe first great consideration), but will also tend, in a tolerable\ndegree, to the welfare and safety of society.  For it is not sought\nin this moderate and prudent measure to be wholly denied that it is\nan inconvenience to Society to be poisoned overmuch.\n\n\n\nLEIGH HUNT:  A REMONSTRANCE\n\n\n\n\"The sense of beauty and gentleness, of moral beauty and faithful\ngentleness, grew upon him as the clear evening closed in.  When he\nwent to visit his relative at Putney, he still carried with him his\nwork, and the books he more immediately wanted.  Although his bodily\npowers had been giving way, his most conspicuous qualities, his\nmemory for books, and his affection remained; and when his hair was\nwhite, when his ample chest had grown slender, when the very\nproportion of his height had visibly lessened, his step was still\nready, and his dark eyes brightened at every happy expression, and\nat every thought of kindness.  His death was simply exhaustion; he\nbroke off his work to lie down and repose.  So gentle was the final\napproach, that he scarcely recognised it till the very last, and\nthen it came without terrors.  His physical suffering had not been\nsevere; at the latest hour he said that his only uneasiness was\nfailing breath.  And that failing breath was used to express his\nsense of the inexhaustible kindness he had received from the family\nwho had been so unexpectedly made his nurses,--to draw from one of\nhis sons, by minute, eager, and searching questions, all that he\ncould learn about the latest vicissitudes and growing hopes of\nItaly,--to ask the friends and children around him for news of those\nwhom he loved,--and to send love and messages to the absent who\nloved him.\"\n\n\nThus, with a manly simplicity and filial affection, writes the\neldest son of Leigh Hunt in recording his father\'s death.  These are\nthe closing words of a new edition of The Autobiography of Leigh\nHunt, published by Messrs. Smith and Elder, of Cornhill, revised by\nthat son, and enriched with an introductory chapter of remarkable\nbeauty and tenderness.  The son\'s first presentation of his father\nto the reader, \"rather tall, straight as an arrow, looking slenderer\nthan he really was; his hair black and shining, and slightly\ninclined to wave; his head high, his forehead straight and white,\nhis eyes black and sparkling, his general complexion dark; in his\nwhole carriage and manner an extraordinary degree of life,\"\ncompletes the picture.  It is the picture of the flourishing and\nfading away of man that is born of a woman and hath but a short time\nto live.\n\nIn his presentation of his father\'s moral nature and intellectual\nqualities, Mr Hunt is no less faithful and no less touching.  Those\nwho knew Leigh Hunt, will see the bright face and hear the musical\nvoice again, when he is recalled to them in this passage:  \"Even at\nseasons of the greatest depression in his fortunes, he always\nattracted many visitors, but still not so much for any repute that\nattended him as for his personal qualities.  Few men were more\nattractive, in society, whether in a large company or over the\nfireside.  His manners were peculiarly animated; his conversation,\nvaried, ranging over a great field of subjects, was moved and called\nforth by the response of his companion, be that companion\nphilosopher or student, sage or boy, man or woman; and he was\nequally ready for the most lively topics or for the gravest\nreflections--his expression easily adapting itself to the tone of\nhis companion\'s mind.  With much freedom of manners, he combined a\nspontaneous courtesy that never failed, and a considerateness\nderived from a ceaseless kindness of heart that invariably\nfascinated even strangers.\"  Or in this:  \"His animation, his\nsympathy with what was gay and pleasurable; his avowed doctrine of\ncultivating cheerfulness, were manifest on the surface, and could be\nappreciated by those who knew him in society, most probably even\nexaggerated as salient traits, on which he himself insisted WITH A\nSORT OF GAY AND OSTENTATIOUS WILFULNESS.\"\n\nThe last words describe one of the most captivating peculiarities of\na most original and engaging man, better than any other words could.\nThe reader is besought to observe them, for a reason that shall\npresently be given.  Lastly:  \"The anxiety to recognise the right of\nothers, the tendency to \'refine\', which was noted by an early school\ncompanion, and the propensity to elaborate every thought, made him,\nalong with the direct argument by which he sustained his own\nconviction, recognise and almost admit all that might be said on the\nopposite side\".  For these reasons, and for others suggested with\nequal felicity, and with equal fidelity, the son writes of the\nfather, \"It is most desirable that his qualities should be known as\nthey were; for such deficiencies as he had are the honest\nexplanation of his mistakes; while, as the reader may see from his\nwritings and his conduct, they are not, as the faults of which he\nwas accused would be, incompatible with the noblest faculties both\nof head and heart.  To know Leigh Hunt as he was, was to hold him in\nreverence and love.\"\n\nThese quotations are made here, with a special object.  It is not,\nthat the personal testimony of one who knew Leigh Hunt well, may be\nborne to their truthfulness.  It is not, that it may be recorded in\nthese pages, as in his son\'s introductory chapter, that his life was\nof the most amiable and domestic kind, that his wants were few, that\nhis way of life was frugal, that he was a man of small expenses, no\nostentations, a diligent labourer, and a secluded man of letters.\nIt is not, that the inconsiderate and forgetful may be reminded of\nhis wrongs and sufferings in the days of the Regency, and of the\nnational disgrace of his imprisonment.  It is not, that their\nforbearance may be entreated for his grave, in right of his graceful\nfancy or his political labours and endurances, though -\n\n\nNot only we, the latest seed of Time,\nNew men, that in the flying of a wheel\nCry down the past, not only we, that prate\nOf rights and wrongs, have loved the people well.\n\n\nIt is, that a duty may be done in the most direct way possible.  An\nact of plain, clear duty.\n\nFour or five years ago, the writer of these lines was much pained by\naccidentally encountering a printed statement, \"that Mr. Leigh Hunt\nwas the original of Harold Skimpole in Bleak House\".  The writer of\nthese lines, is the author of that book.  The statement came from\nAmerica.  It is no disrespect to that country, in which the writer\nhas, perhaps, as many friends and as true an interest as any man\nthat lives, good-humouredly to state the fact, that he has, now and\nthen, been the subject of paragraphs in Transatlantic newspapers,\nmore surprisingly destitute of all foundation in truth than the\nwildest delusions of the wildest lunatics.  For reasons born of this\nexperience, he let the thing go by.\n\nBut, since Mr. Leigh Hunt\'s death, the statement has been revived in\nEngland.  The delicacy and generosity evinced in its revival, are\nfor the rather late consideration of its revivers.  The fact is\nthis:\n\nExactly those graces and charms of manner which are remembered in\nthe words we have quoted, were remembered by the author of the work\nof fiction in question, when he drew the character in question.\nAbove all other things, that \"sort of gay and ostentatious\nwilfulness\" in the humouring of a subject, which had many a time\ndelighted him, and impressed him as being unspeakably whimsical and\nattractive, was the airy quality he wanted for the man he invented.\nPartly for this reason, and partly (he has since often grieved to\nthink) for the pleasure it afforded him to find that delightful\nmanner reproducing itself under his hand, he yielded to the\ntemptation of too often making the character SPEAK like his old\nfriend.  He no more thought, God forgive him! that the admired\noriginal would ever be charged with the imaginary vices of the\nfictitious creature, than he has himself ever thought of charging\nthe blood of Desdemona and Othello, on the innocent Academy model\nwho sat for Iago\'s leg in the picture.  Even as to the mere\noccasional manner, he meant to be so cautious and conscientious,\nthat he privately referred the proof sheets of the first number of\nthat book to two intimate literary friends of Leigh Hunt (both still\nliving), and altered the whole of that part of the text on their\ndiscovering too strong a resemblance to his \"way\".\n\nHe cannot see the son lay this wreath on the father\'s tomb, and\nleave him to the possibility of ever thinking that the present words\nmight have righted the father\'s memory and were left unwritten.  He\ncannot know that his own son may have to explain his father when\nfolly or malice can wound his heart no more, and leave this task\nundone.\n\n\n\nTHE TATTLESNIVEL BLEATER\n\n\n\nThe pen is taken in hand on the present occasion, by a private\nindividual (not wholly unaccustomed to literary composition), for\nthe exposure of a conspiracy of a most frightful nature; a\nconspiracy which, like the deadly Upas-tree of Java, on which the\nindividual produced a poem in his earlier youth (not wholly devoid\nof length), which was so flatteringly received (in circles not\nwholly unaccustomed to form critical opinions), that he was\nrecommended to publish it, and would certainly have carried out the\nsuggestion, but for private considerations (not wholly unconnected\nwith expense).\n\nThe individual who undertakes the exposure of the gigantic\nconspiracy now to be laid bare in all its hideous deformity, is an\ninhabitant of the town of Tattlesnivel--a lowly inhabitant, it may\nbe, but one who, as an Englishman and a man, will ne\'er abase his\neye before the gaudy and the mocking throng.\n\nTattlesnivel stoops to demand no championship from her sons.  On an\noccasion in History, our bluff British monarch, our Eighth Royal\nHarry, almost went there.  And long ere the periodical in which this\nexposure will appear, had sprung into being, Tattlesnivel had\nunfurled that standard which yet waves upon her battlements.  The\nstandard alluded to, is THE TATTLESNIVEL BLEATER, containing the\nlatest intelligence, and state of markets, down to the hour of going\nto press, and presenting a favourable local medium for advertisers,\non a graduated scale of charges, considerably diminishing in\nproportion to the guaranteed number of insertions.\n\nIt were bootless to expatiate on the host of talent engaged in\nformidable phalanx to do fealty to the Bleater.  Suffice it to\nselect, for present purposes, one of the most gifted and (but for\nthe wide and deep ramifications of an un-English conspiracy) most\nrising, of the men who are bold Albion\'s pride.  It were needless,\nafter this preamble, to point the finger more directly at the LONDON\nCORRESPONDENT OF THE TATTLESNIVEL BLEATER.\n\nOn the weekly letters of that Correspondent, on the flexibility of\ntheir English, on the boldness of their grammar, on the originality\nof their quotations (never to be found as they are printed, in any\nbook existing), on the priority of their information, on their\nintimate acquaintance with the secret thoughts and unexecuted\nintentions of men, it would ill become the humble Tattlesnivellian\nwho traces these words, to dwell.  They are graven in the memory;\nthey are on the Bleater\'s file.  Let them be referred to.\n\nBut from the infamous, the dark, the subtle conspiracy which spreads\nits baleful roots throughout the land, and of which the Bleater\'s\nLondon Correspondent is the one sole subject, it is the purpose of\nthe lowly Tattlesnivellian who undertakes this revelation, to tear\nthe veil.  Nor will he shrink from his self-imposed labour,\nHerculean though it be.\n\nThe conspiracy begins in the very Palace of the Sovereign Lady of\nour Ocean Isle.  Leal and loyal as it is the proud vaunt of the\nBleater\'s readers, one and all, to be, the inhabitant who pens this\nexposure does not personally impeach, either her Majesty the queen,\nor the illustrious Prince Consort.  But, some silken-clad smoothers,\nsome purple parasites, some fawners in frippery, some greedy and\nbegartered ones in gorgeous garments, he does impeach--ay, and\nwrathfully!  Is it asked on what grounds?  They shall be stated.\n\nThe Bleater\'s London Correspondent, in the prosecution of his\nimportant inquiries, goes down to Windsor, sends in his card, has a\nconfidential interview with her Majesty and the illustrious Prince\nConsort.  For a time, the restraints of Royalty are thrown aside in\nthe cheerful conversation of the Bleater\'s London Correspondent, in\nhis fund of information, in his flow of anecdote, in the atmosphere\nof his genius; her Majesty brightens, the illustrious Prince Consort\nthaws, the cares of State and the conflicts of Party are forgotten,\nlunch is proposed.  Over that unassuming and domestic table, her\nMajesty communicates to the Bleater\'s London Correspondent that it\nis her intention to send his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to\ninspect the top of the Great Pyramid--thinking it likely to improve\nhis acquaintance with the views of the people.  Her Majesty further\ncommunicates that she has made up her royal mind (and that the\nPrince Consort has made up his illustrious mind) to the bestowal of\nthe vacant Garter, let us say on Mr. Roebuck.  The younger Royal\nchildren having been introduced at the request of the Bleater\'s\nLondon Correspondent, and having been by him closely observed to\npresent the usual external indications of good health, the happy\nknot is severed, with a sigh the Royal bow is once more strung to\nits full tension, the Bleater\'s London Correspondent returns to\nLondon, writes his letter, and tells the Tattlesnivel Bleater what\nhe knows.  All Tattlesnivel reads it, and knows that he knows it.\nBut, DOES his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales ultimately go to\nthe top of the Great Pyramid?  DOES Mr. Roebuck ultimately get the\nGarter?  No.  Are the younger Royal children even ultimately found\nto be well?  On the contrary, they have--and on that very day had--\nthe measles.  Why is this?  BECAUSE THE CONSPIRATORS AGAINST THE\nBLEATER\'S LONDON CORRESPONDENT HAVE STEPPED IN WITH THEIR DARK\nMACHINATIONS.  Because her Majesty and the Prince Consort are\nartfully induced to change their minds, from north to south, from\neast to west, immediately after it is known to the conspirators that\nthey have put themselves in communication with the Bleater\'s London\nCorrespondent.  It is now indignantly demanded, by whom are they so\ntampered with?  It is now indignantly demanded, who took the\nresponsibility of concealing the indisposition of those Royal\nchildren from their Royal and illustrious parents, and of bringing\nthem down from their beds, disguised, expressly to confound the\nLondon Correspondent of the Tattlesnivel Bleater?  Who are those\npersons, it is again asked?  Let not rank and favour protect them.\nLet the traitors be exhibited in the face of day!\n\nLord John Russell is in this conspiracy.  Tell us not that his\nLordship is a man of too much spirit and honour.  Denunciation is\nhurled against him.  The proof?  The proof is here.\n\nThe Time is panting for an answer to the question, Will Lord John\nRussell consent to take office under Lord Palmerston?  Good.  The\nLondon Correspondent of the Tattlesnivel Bleater is in the act of\nwriting his weekly letter, finds himself rather at a loss to settle\nthis question finally, leaves off, puts his hat on, goes down to the\nlobby of the House of Commons, sends in for Lord John Russell, and\nhas him out.  He draws his arm through his Lordship\'s, takes him\naside, and says, \"John, will you ever accept office under\nPalmerston?\"  His Lordship replies, \"I will not.\"  The Bleater\'s\nLondon Correspondent retorts, with the caution such a man is bound\nto use, \"John, think again; say nothing to me rashly; is there any\ntemper here?\"  His Lordship replies, calmly, \"None whatever.\"  After\ngiving him time for reflection, the Bleater\'s London Correspondent\nsays, \"Once more, John, let me put a question to you.  Will you ever\naccept office under Palmerston?\"  His Lordship answers (note the\nexact expressions), \"Nothing shall induce me, ever to accept a seat\nin a Cabinet of which Palmerston is the Chief.\"  They part, the\nLondon Correspondent of the Tattlesnivel Bleater finishes his\nletter, and--always being withheld by motives of delicacy, from\nplainly divulging his means of getting accurate information on every\nsubject, at first hand--puts in it, this passage:  \"Lord John\nRussell is spoken of, by blunderers, for Foreign Affairs; but I have\nthe best reasons for assuring your readers, that\" (giving prominence\nto the exact expressions, it will be observed) \"\'NOTHING WILL EVER\nINDUCE HIM, TO ACCEPT A SEAT IN A CABINET OF WHICH PALMERSTON IS THE\nCHIEF.\'  On this you may implicitly rely.\"  What happens?  On the\nvery day of the publication of that number of the Bleater--the\nmalignity of the conspirators being even manifested in the selection\nof the day--Lord John Russell takes the Foreign Office!  Comment\nwere superfluous.\n\nThe people of Tattlesnivel will be told, have been told, that Lord\nJohn Russell is a man of his word.  He may be, on some occasions;\nbut, when overshadowed by this dark and enormous growth of\nconspiracy, Tattlesnivel knows him to be otherwise.  \"I happen to be\ncertain, deriving my information from a source which cannot be\ndoubted to be authentic,\" wrote the London Correspondent of the\nBleater, within the last year, \"that Lord John Russell bitterly\nregrets having made that explicit speech of last Monday.\"  These are\nnot roundabout phrases; these are plain words.  What does Lord John\nRussell (apparently by accident), within eight-and-forty hours after\ntheir diffusion over the civilised globe?  Rises in his place in\nParliament, and unblushingly declares that if the occasion could\narise five hundred times, for his making that very speech, he would\nmake it five hundred times!  Is there no conspiracy here?  And is\nthis combination against one who would be always right if he were\nnot proved always wrong, to be endured in a country that boasts of\nits freedom and its fairness?\n\nBut, the Tattlesnivellian who now raises his voice against\nintolerable oppression, may be told that, after all, this is a\npolitical conspiracy.  He may be told, forsooth, that Mr. Disraeli\'s\nbeing in it, that Lord Derby\'s being in it, that Mr. Bright\'s being\nin it, that every Home, Foreign, and Colonial Secretary\'s being in\nit, that every ministry\'s and every opposition\'s being in it, are\nbut proofs that men will do in politics what they would do in\nnothing else.  Is this the plea?  If so, the rejoinder is, that the\nmighty conspiracy includes the whole circle of Artists of all kinds,\nand comprehends all degrees of men, down to the worst criminal and\nthe hangman who ends his career.  For, all these are intimately\nknown to the London Correspondent of the Tattlesnivel Bleater, and\nall these deceive him.\n\nSir, put it to the proof.  There is the Bleater on the file--\ndocumentary evidence.  Weeks, months, before the Exhibition of the\nRoyal Academy, the Bleater\'s London Correspondent knows the subjects\nof all the leading pictures, knows what the painters first meant to\ndo, knows what they afterwards substituted for what they first meant\nto do, knows what they ought to do and won\'t do, knows what they\nought not to do and will do, knows to a letter from whom they have\ncommissions, knows to a shilling how much they are to be paid.  Now,\nno sooner is each studio clear of the remarkable man to whom each\nstudio-occupant has revealed himself as he does not reveal himself\nto his nearest and dearest bosom friend, than conspiracy and fraud\nbegin.  Alfred the Great becomes the Fairy Queen; Moses viewing the\nPromised Land, turns out to be Moses going to the Fair; Portrait of\nHis Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury, is transformed, as if by\nirreverent enchantment of the dissenting interest, into A Favourite\nTerrier, or Cattle Grazing; and the most extraordinary work of art\nin the list described by the Bleater, is coolly sponged out\naltogether, and asserted never to have had existence at all, even in\nthe most shadow thoughts of its executant!  This is vile enough, but\nthis is not all.  Picture-buyers then come forth from their secret\npositions, and creep into their places in the assassin-multitude of\nconspirators.  Mr. Baring, after expressly telling the Bleater\'s\nLondon Correspondent that he had bought No. 39 for one thousand\nguineas, gives it up to somebody unknown for a couple of hundred\npounds; the Marquis of Lansdowne pretends to have no knowledge\nwhatever of the commissions to which the London Correspondent of the\nBleater swore him, but allows a Railway Contractor to cut him out\nfor half the money.  Similar examples might be multiplied.  Shame,\nshame, on these men!  Is this England?\n\nSir, look again at Literature.  The Bleater\'s London Correspondent\nis not merely acquainted with all the eminent writers, but is in\npossession of the secrets of their souls.  He is versed in their\nhidden meanings and references, sees their manuscripts before\npublication, and knows the subjects and titles of their books when\nthey are not begun.  How dare those writers turn upon the eminent\nman and depart from every intention they have confided to him?  How\ndo they justify themselves in entirely altering their manuscripts,\nchanging their titles, and abandoning their subjects?  Will they\ndeny, in the face of Tattlesnivel, that they do so?  If they have\nsuch hardihood, let the file of the Bleater strike them dumb.  By\ntheir fruits they shall be known.  Let their works be compared with\nthe anticipatory letters of the Bleater\'s London Correspondent, and\ntheir falsehood and deceit will become manifest as the sun; it will\nbe seen that they do nothing which they stand pledged to the\nBleater\'s London Correspondent to do; it will be seen that they are\namong the blackest parties in this black and base conspiracy.  This\nwill become apparent, sir, not only as to their public proceedings\nbut as to their private affairs.  The outraged Tattlesnivellian who\nnow drags this infamous combination into the face of day, charges\nthose literary persons with making away with their property,\nimposing on the Income Tax Commissioners, keeping false books, and\nentering into sham contracts.  He accuses them on the unimpeachable\nfaith of the London Correspondent of the Tattlesnivel Bleater.  With\nwhose evidence they will find it impossible to reconcile their own\naccount of any transaction of their lives.\n\nThe national character is degenerating under the influence of the\nramifications of this tremendous conspiracy.  Forgery is committed,\nconstantly.  A person of note--any sort of person of note--dies.\nThe Bleater\'s London Correspondent knows what his circumstances are,\nwhat his savings are (if any), who his creditors are, all about his\nchildren and relations, and (in general, before his body is cold)\ndescribes his will.  Is that will ever proved?  Never!  Some other\nwill is substituted; the real instrument, destroyed.  And this (as\nhas been before observed), is England.\n\nWho are the workmen and artificers, enrolled upon the books of this\ntreacherous league?  From what funds are they paid, and with what\nceremonies are they sworn to secrecy?  Are there none such?  Observe\nwhat follows.  A little time ago the Bleater\'s London Correspondent\nhad this passage:  \"Boddleboy is pianoforte playing at St.\nJanuarius\'s Gallery, with pretty tolerable success!  He clears three\nhundred pounds per night.  Not bad this!!\"  The builder of St.\nJanuarius\'s Gallery (plunged to the throat in the conspiracy) met\nwith this piece of news, and observed, with characteristic\ncoarseness, \"that the Bleater\'s London Correspondent was a Blind\nAss\".  Being pressed by a man of spirit to give his reasons for this\nextraordinary statement, he declared that the Gallery, crammed to\nsuffocation, would not hold two hundred pounds, and that its\nexpenses were, probably, at least half what it did hold.  The man of\nspirit (himself a Tattlesnivellian) had the Gallery measured within\na week from that hour, and it would not hold two hundred pounds!\nNow, can the poorest capacity doubt that it had been altered in the\nmeantime?\n\nAnd so the conspiracy extends, through every grade of society, down\nto the condemned criminal in prison, the hangman, and the Ordinary.\nEvery famous murderer within the last ten years has desecrated his\nlast moments by falsifying his confidences imparted specially to the\nLondon Correspondent of the Tattlesnivel Bleater; on every such\noccasion, Mr. Calcraft has followed the degrading example; and the\nreverend Ordinary, forgetful of his cloth, and mindful only (it\nwould seem, alas!) of the conspiracy, has committed himself to some\naccount or other of the criminal\'s demeanour and conversation, which\nhas been diametrically opposed to the exclusive information of the\nLondon Correspondent of the Bleater.  And this (as has been before\nobserved) is Merry England!\n\nA man of true genius, however, is not easily defeated.  The\nBleater\'s London Correspondent, probably beginning to suspect the\nexistence of a plot against him, has recently fallen on a new style,\nwhich, as being very difficult to countermine, may necessitate the\norganisation of a new conspiracy.  One of his masterly letters,\nlately, disclosed the adoption of this style--which was remarked\nwith profound sensation throughout Tattlesnivel--in the following\npassage:  \"Mentioning literary small talk, I may tell you that some\nnew and extraordinary rumours are afloat concerning the\nconversations I have previously mentioned, alleged to have taken\nplace in the first floor front (situated over the street door), of\nMr. X. Ameter (the poet so well known to your readers), in which, X.\nAmeter\'s great uncle, his second son, his butcher, and a corpulent\ngentleman with one eye universally respected at Kensington, are said\nnot to have been on the most friendly footing; I forbear, however,\nto pursue the subject further, this week, my informant not being\nable to supply me with exact particulars.\"\n\nBut, enough, sir.  The inhabitant of Tattlesnivel who has taken pen\nin hand to expose this odious association of unprincipled men\nagainst a shining (local) character, turns from it with disgust and\ncontempt.  Let him in few words strip the remaining flimsy covering\nfrom the nude object of the conspirators, and his loathsome task is\nended.\n\nSir, that object, he contends, is evidently twofold.  First, to\nexhibit the London Correspondent of the Tattlesnivel Bleater in the\nlight of a mischievous Blockhead who, by hiring himself out to tell\nwhat he cannot possibly know, is as great a public nuisance as a\nBlockhead in a corner can be.  Second, to suggest to the men of\nTattlesnivel that it does not improve their town to have so much Dry\nRubbish shot there.\n\nNow, sir, on both these points Tattlesnivel demands in accents of\nThunder, Where is the Attorney General?  Why doesn\'t the Times take\nit up?  (Is the latter in the conspiracy?  It never adopts his\nviews, or quotes him, and incessantly contradicts him.)\nTattlesnivel, sir, remembering that our forefathers contended with\nthe Norman at Hastings, and bled at a variety of other places that\nwill readily occur to you, demands that its birthright shall not be\nbartered away for a mess of pottage.  Have a care, sir, have a care!\nOr Tattlesnivel (its idle Rifles piled in its scouted streets) may\nbe seen ere long, advancing with its Bleater to the foot of the\nThrone, and demanding redress for this conspiracy, from the orbed\nand sceptred hands of Majesty itself!\n\n\n\nTHE YOUNG MAN FROM THE COUNTRY\n\n\n\nA song of the hour, now in course of being sung and whistled in\nevery street, the other day reminded the writer of these words--as\nhe chanced to pass a fag-end of the song for the twentieth time in a\nshort London walk--that twenty years ago, a little book on the\nUnited States, entitled American Notes, was published by \"a Young\nMan from the Country\", who had just seen and left it.\n\nThis Young Man from the Country fell into a deal of trouble, by\nreason of having taken the liberty to believe that he perceived in\nAmerica downward popular tendencies for which his young enthusiasm\nhad been anything but prepared.  It was in vain for the Young Man to\noffer in extenuation of his belief that no stranger could have set\nfoot on those shores with a feeling of livelier interest in the\ncountry, and stronger faith in it, than he.  Those were the days\nwhen the Tories had made their Ashburton Treaty, and when Whigs and\nRadicals must have no theory disturbed.  All three parties waylaid\nand mauled the Young Man from the Country, and showed that he knew\nnothing about the country.\n\nAs the Young Man from the Country had observed in the Preface to his\nlittle book, that he \"could bide his time\", he took all this in\nsilent part for eight years.  Publishing then, a cheap edition of\nhis book, he made no stronger protest than the following:\n\n\n\"My readers have opportunities of judging for themselves whether the\ninfluences and tendencies which I distrusted in America, have any\nexistence but in my imagination.  They can examine for themselves\nwhether there has been anything in the public career of that country\nduring these past eight years, or whether there is anything in its\npresent position, at home or abroad, which suggests that those\ninfluences and tendencies really do exist.  As they find the fact,\nthey will judge me.  If they discern any evidences of wrong-going,\nin any direction that I have indicated, they will acknowledge that I\nhad reason in what I wrote.  If they discern no such thing, they\nwill consider me altogether mistaken.  I have nothing to defend, or\nto explain away.  The truth is the truth; and neither childish\nabsurdities, nor unscrupulous contradictions, can make it otherwise.\nThe earth would still move round the sun, though the whole Catholic\nChurch said No.\"\n\n\nTwelve more years having since passed away, it may now, at last, be\nsimply just towards the Young Man from the Country, to compare what\nhe originally wrote, with recent events and their plain motive\npowers.  Treating of the House of Representatives at Washington, he\nwrote thus:\n\n\n\"Did I recognise in this assembly, a body of men, who, applying\nthemselves in a new world to correct some of the falsehoods and\nvices of the old, purified the avenues to Public Life, paved the\ndirty ways to Place and Power, debated and made laws for the Common\nGood, and had no party but their Country?\n\n\"I saw in them, the wheels that move the meanest perversion of\nvirtuous Political Machinery that the worst tools ever wrought.\nDespicable trickery at elections; under-handed tamperings with\npublic officers; cowardly attacks upon opponents, with scurrilous\nnewspapers for shields, and hired pens for daggers; shameful\ntrucklings to mercenary knaves, whose claim to be considered, is,\nthat every day and week they sow new crops of ruin with their venal\ntypes, which are the dragon\'s teeth of yore, in everything but\nsharpness; aidings and abettings of every bad inclination in the\npopular mind, and artful suppressions of all its good influences:\nsuch things as these, and in a word, Dishonest Faction in its most\ndepraved and most unblushing form, stared out from every corner of\nthe crowded hall.\n\n\"Did I see among them, the intelligence and refinement:  the true,\nhonest, patriotic heart of America?  Here and there, were drops of\nits blood and life, but they scarcely coloured the stream of\ndesperate adventurers which sets that way for profit and for pay.\nIt is the game of these men, and of their profligate organs, to make\nthe strife of politics so fierce and brutal, and so destructive of\nall self-respect in worthy men, that sensitive and delicate-minded\npersons shall be kept aloof, and they, and such as they, be left to\nbattle out their selfish views unchecked.  And thus this lowest of\nall scrambling fights goes on, and they who in other countries\nwould, from their intelligence and station, most aspire to make the\nlaws, do here recoil the farthest from that degradation.\n\n\"That there are, among the representatives of the people in both\nHouses, and among all parties, some men of high character and great\nabilities, I need not say.  The foremost among those politicians who\nare known in Europe, have been already described, and I see no\nreason to depart from the rule I have laid down for my guidance, of\nabstaining from all mention of individuals.  It will be sufficient\nto add, that to the most favourable accounts that have been written\nof them, I fully and most heartily subscribe; and that personal\nintercourse and free communication have bred within me, not the\nresult predicted in the very doubtful proverb, but increased\nadmiration and respect.\"\n\nTowards the end of his book, the Young Man from the Country thus\nexpressed himself concerning its people:\n\n\n\"They are, by nature, frank, brave, cordial, hospitable, and\naffectionate.  Cultivation and refinement seem but to enhance their\nwarmth of heart and ardent enthusiasm; and it is the possession of\nthese latter qualities in a most remarkable degree, which renders an\neducated American one of the most endearing and most generous of\nfriends.  I never was so won upon, as by this class; never yielded\nup my full confidence and esteem so readily and pleasurably, as to\nthem; never can make again, in half a year, so many friends for whom\nI seem to entertain the regard of half a life.\n\n\"These qualities are natural, I implicitly believe, to the whole\npeople.  That they are, however, sadly sapped and blighted in their\ngrowth among the mass; and that there are influences at work which\nendanger them still more, and give but little present promise of\ntheir healthy restoration; is a truth that ought to be told.\n\n\"It is an essential part of every national character to pique itself\nmightily upon its faults, and to deduce tokens of its virtue or its\nwisdom from their very exaggeration.  One great blemish in the\npopular mind of America, and the prolific parent of an innumerable\nbrood of evils, is Universal Distrust.  Yet the American citizen\nplumes himself upon this spirit, even when he is sufficiently\ndispassionate to perceive the ruin it works; and will often adduce\nit, in spite of his own reason, as an instance of the great sagacity\nand acuteness of the people, and their superior shrewdness and\nindependence.\n\n\"\'You carry,\' says the stranger, \'this jealousy and distrust into\nevery transaction of public life.  By repelling worthy men from your\nlegislative assemblies, it has bred up a class of candidates for the\nsuffrage, who, in their every act, disgrace your Institutions and\nyour people\'s choice.  It has rendered you so fickle, and so given\nto change, that your inconstancy has passed into a proverb; for you\nno sooner set up an idol firmly, than you are sure to pull it down\nand dash it into fragments:  and this, because directly you reward a\nbenefactor, or a public-servant, you distrust him, merely because he\nIS rewarded; and immediately apply yourselves to find out, either\nthat you have been too bountiful in your acknowledgments, or he\nremiss in his deserts.  Any man who attains a high place among you,\nfrom the President downwards, may date his downfall from that\nmoment; for any printed lie that any notorious villain pens,\nalthough it militate directly against the character and conduct of a\nlife, appeals at once to your distrust, and is believed.  You will\nstrain at a gnat in the way of trustfulness and confidence, however\nfairly won and well deserved; but you will swallow a whole caravan\nof camels, if they be laden with unworthy doubts and mean\nsuspicions.  Is this well, think you, or likely to elevate the\ncharacter of the governors or the governed, among you?\'\n\n\"The answer is invariably the same:  \'There\'s freedom of opinion\nhere, you know.  Every man thinks for himself, and we are not to be\neasily overreached.  That\'s how our people come to be suspicious.\'\n\n\"Another prominent feature is the love of \'smart\' dealing:  which\ngilds over many a swindle and gross breach of trust; many a\ndefalcation, public and private; and enables many a knave to hold\nhis head up with the best, who well deserves a halter:  though it\nhas not been without its retributive operation, for this smartness\nhas done more in a few years to impair the public credit, and to\ncripple the public resources, than dull honesty, however rash, could\nhave effected in a century.  The merits of a broken speculation, or\na bankruptcy, or of a successful scoundrel, are not gauged by its or\nhis observance of the golden rule, \'Do as you would be done by\', but\nare considered with reference to their smartness.  I recollect, on\nboth occasions of our passing that ill-fated Cairo on the\nMississippi, remarking on the bad effects such gross deceits must\nhave when they exploded, in generating a want of confidence abroad,\nand discouraging foreign investment:  but I was given to understand\nthat this was a very smart scheme by which a deal of money had been\nmade:  and that its smartest feature was, that they forgot these\nthings abroad, in a very short time, and speculated again, as freely\nas ever.  The following dialogue I have held a hundred times:  \'Is\nit not a very disgraceful circumstance that such a man as So-and-so\nshould be acquiring a large property by the most infamous and odious\nmeans, and notwithstanding all the crimes of which he has been\nguilty, should be tolerated and abetted by your citizens?  He is a\npublic nuisance, is he not?\'  \'Yes, sir.\'  \'A convicted liar?\'\n\'Yes, sir.\'  \'He has been kicked, and cuffed, and caned?\'  \'Yes,\nsir.\'  \'And he is utterly dishonourable, debased, and profligate?\'\n\'Yes, sir.\'  \'In the name of wonder, then, what is his merit?\'\n\'Well, sir, he is a smart man.\'\n\n\"But the foul growth of America has a more tangled root than this;\nand it strikes its fibres, deep in its licentious Press.\n\n\"Schools may he erected, East, West, North, and South; pupils be\ntaught, and masters reared, by scores upon scores of thousands;\ncolleges may thrive, churches may be crammed, temperance may be\ndiffused, and advancing knowledge in all other forms walk through\nthe land with giant strides; but while the newspaper press of\nAmerica is in, or near, its present abject state, high moral\nimprovement in that country is hopeless.  Year by year, it must and\nwill go back; year by year, the tone of public opinion must sink\nlower down; year by year, the Congress and the Senate must become of\nless account before all decent men; and year by year, the memory of\nthe Great Fathers of the Revolution must be outraged more and more,\nin the bad life of their degenerate child.\n\n\"Among the herd of journals which are published in the States, there\nare some, the reader scarcely need be told, of character and credit.\nFrom personal intercourse with accomplished gentlemen connected with\npublications of this class, I have derived both pleasure and profit.\nBut the name of these is Few, and of the others Legion; and the\ninfluence of the good, is powerless to counteract the moral poison\nof the bad.\n\n\"Among the gentry of America; among the well-informed and moderate;\nin the learned professions; at the bar and on the bench; there is,\nas there can be, but one opinion, in reference to the vicious\ncharacter of these infamous journals.  It is sometimes contended--I\nwill not say strangely, for it is natural to seek excuses for such a\ndisgrace--that their influence is not so great as a visitor would\nsuppose.  I must be pardoned for saying that there is no warrant for\nthis plea, and that every fact and circumstance tends directly to\nthe opposite conclusion.\n\n\"When any man, of any grade of desert in intellect or character, can\nclimb to any public distinction, no matter what, in America, without\nfirst grovelling down upon the earth, and bending the knee before\nthis monster of depravity; when any private excellence is safe from\nits attacks; when any social confidence is left unbroken by it; or\nany tie of social decency and honour is held in the least regard;\nwhen any man in that Free Country has freedom of opinion, and\npresumes to think for himself, and speak for himself, without humble\nreference to a censorship which, for its rampant ignorance and base\ndishonesty, he utterly loaths and despises in his heart; when those\nwho most acutely feel its infamy and the reproach it casts upon the\nnation, and who most denounce it to each other, dare to set their\nheels upon, and crush it openly, in the sight of all men:  then, I\nwill believe that its influence is lessening, and men are returning\nto their manly senses.  But while that Press has its evil eye in\nevery house, and its black hand in every appointment in the state,\nfrom a president to a postman; while, with ribald slander for its\nonly stock in trade, it is the standard literature of an enormous\nclass, who must find their reading in a newspaper, or they will not\nread at all; so long must its odium be upon the country\'s head, and\nso long must the evil it works, be plainly visible in the Republic.\"\n\n\nThe foregoing was written in the year eighteen hundred and forty-\ntwo.  It rests with the reader to decide whether it has received any\nconfirmation, or assumed any colour of truth, in or about the year\neighteen hundred and sixty-two.\n\n\n\nAN ENLIGHTENED CLERGYMAN\n\n\n\nAt various places in Suffolk (as elsewhere) penny readings take\nplace \"for the instruction and amusement of the lower classes\".\nThere is a little town in Suffolk called Eye, where the subject of\none of these readings was a tale (by Mr. Wilkie Collins) from the\nlast Christmas Number of this Journal, entitled \"Picking up Waifs at\nSea\".  It appears that the Eye gentility was shocked by the\nintroduction of this rude piece among the taste and musical glasses\nof that important town, on which the eyes of Europe are notoriously\nalways fixed.  In particular, the feelings of the vicar\'s family\nwere outraged; and a Local Organ (say, the Tattlesnivel Bleater)\nconsequently doomed the said piece to everlasting oblivion, as being\nof an \"injurious tendency!\"\n\nWhen this fearful fact came to the knowledge of the unhappy writer\nof the doomed tale in question, he covered his face with his robe,\nprevious to dying decently under the sharp steel of the\necclesiastical gentility of the terrible town of Eye.  But the\ndiscovery that he was not alone in his gloomy glory, revived him,\nand he still lives.\n\nFor, at Stowmarket, in the aforesaid county of Suffolk, at another\nof those penny readings, it was announced that a certain juvenile\nsketch, culled from a volume of sketches (by Boz) and entitled \"The\nBloomsbury Christening\", would be read.  Hereupon, the clergyman of\nthat place took heart and pen, and addressed the following terrific\nepistle to a gentleman bearing the very appropriate name of Gudgeon:\n\n\nSTOWMARKET VICARAGE, Feb. 25, 1861.\n\nSIR,--My attention has been directed to a piece called \"The\nBloomsbury Christening\" which you propose to read this evening.\nWithout presuming to claim any interference in the arrangement of\nthe readings, I would suggest to you whether you have on this\noccasion sufficiently considered the character of the composition\nyou have selected.  I quite appreciate the laudable motive of the\npromoters of the readings to raise the moral tone amongst the\nworking class of the town and to direct this taste in a familiar and\npleasant manner.  \"The Bloomsbury Christening\" cannot possibly do\nthis.  It trifles with a sacred ordinance, and the language and\nstyle, instead of improving the taste, has a direct tendency to\nlower it.\n\nI appeal to your right feeling whether it is desirable to give\npublicity to that which must shock several of your audience, and\ncreate a smile amongst others, to be indulged in only by violating\nthe conscientious scruples of their neighbours.\n\nThe ordinance which is here exposed to ridicule is one which is much\nmisunderstood and neglected amongst many families belonging to the\nChurch of England, and the mode in which it is treated in this\nchapter cannot fail to appear as giving a sanction to, or at least\nexcusing, such neglect.\n\nAlthough you are pledged to the public to give this subject, yet I\ncannot but believe that they would fully justify your substitution\nof it for another did they know the circumstances.  An abridgment\nwould only lessen the evil in a degree, as it is not only the style\nof the writing but the subject itself which is objectionable.\n\nExcuse me for troubling you, but I felt that, in common with\nyourself, I have a grave responsibility in the matter, and I am most\ntruly yours,\n\nT. S. COLES.\nTo Mr. J. Gudgeon.\n\n\nIt is really necessary to explain that this is not a bad joke.  It\nis simply a bad fact.\n\n\n\nRATHER A STRONG DOSE\n\n\n\n\"Doctor John Campbell, the minister of the Tabernacle Chapel,\nFinsbury, and editor of the British Banner, etc., with that massive\nvigour which distinguishes his style,\" did, we are informed by Mr.\nHowitt, \"deliver a verdict in the Banner, for November, 1852,\" of\ngreat importance and favour to the Table-rapping cause.  We are not\ninformed whether the Public, sitting in judgment on the question,\nreserved any point in this great verdict for subsequent\nconsideration; but the verdict would seem to have been regarded by a\nperverse generation as not quite final, inasmuch as Mr. Howitt finds\nit necessary to re-open the case, a round ten years afterwards, in\nnine hundred and sixty-two stiff octavo pages, published by Messrs.\nLongman and Company.\n\nMr. Howitt is in such a bristling temper on the Supernatural\nsubject, that we will not take the great liberty of arguing any\npoint with him.  But--with the view of assisting him to make\nconverts--we will inform our readers, on his conclusive authority,\nwhat they are required to believe; premising what may rather\nastonish them in connexion with their views of a certain historical\ntrifle, called The Reformation, that their present state of unbelief\nis all the fault of Protestantism, and that \"it is high time,\ntherefore, to protest against Protestantism\".\n\nThey will please to believe, by way of an easy beginning, all the\nstories of good and evil demons, ghosts, prophecies, communication\nwith spirits, and practice of magic, that ever obtained, or are said\nto have ever obtained, in the North, in the South, in the East, in\nthe West, from the earliest and darkest ages, as to which we have\nany hazy intelligence, real or supposititious, down to the yet\nunfinished displacement of the red men in North America.  They will\nplease to believe that nothing in this wise was changed by the\nfulfilment of our Saviour\'s mission upon earth; and further, that\nwhat Saint Paul did, can be done again, and has been done again.  As\nthis is not much to begin with, they will throw in at this point\nrejection of Faraday and Brewster, and \"poor Paley\", and implicit\nacceptance of those shining lights, the Reverend Charles Beecher,\nand the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher (\"one of the most vigorous and\neloquent preachers of America\"), and the Reverend Adin Ballou.\n\nHaving thus cleared the way for a healthy exercise of faith, our\nadvancing readers will next proceed especially to believe in the old\nstory of the Drummer of Tedworth, in the inspiration of George Fox,\nin \"the spiritualism, prophecies, and provision\" of Huntington the\ncoal-porter (him who prayed for the leather breeches which\nmiraculously fitted him), and even in the Cock Lane Ghost.  They\nwill please wind up, before fetching their breath, with believing\nthat there is a close analogy between rejection of any such plain\nand proved facts as those contained in the whole foregoing\ncatalogue, and the opposition encountered by the inventors of\nrailways, lighting by gas, microscopes and telescopes, and\nvaccination.  This stinging consideration they will always carry\nrankling in their remorseful hearts as they advance.\n\nAs touching the Cock Lane Ghost, our conscience-stricken readers\nwill please particularly to reproach themselves for having ever\nsupposed that important spiritual manifestation to have been a gross\nimposture which was thoroughly detected.  They will please to\nbelieve that Dr. Johnson believed in it, and that, in Mr. Howitt\'s\nwords, he \"appears to have had excellent reasons for his belief\".\nWith a view to this end, the faithful will be so good as to\nobliterate from their Boswells the following passage:  \"Many of my\nreaders, I am convinced, are to this hour under an impression that\nJohnson was thus foolishly deceived.  It will therefore surprise\nthem a good deal when they are informed upon undoubted authority\nthat Johnson was one of those by whom the imposture was detected.\nThe story had become so popular, that he thought it should be\ninvestigated, and in this research he was assisted by the Rev. Dr.\nDouglas, now Bishop of Salisbury, the great detector of impostures\"-\n-and therefore tremendously obnoxious to Mr. Howitt--\"who informs me\nthat after the gentlemen who went and examined into the evidence\nwere satisfied of its falsity, Johnson wrote in their presence an\naccount of it, which was published in the newspapers and Gentleman\'s\nMagazine, and undeceived the world\".  But as there will still remain\nanother highly inconvenient passage in the Boswells of the true\nbelievers, they must likewise be at the trouble of cancelling the\nfollowing also, referring to a later time:  \"He (Johnson) expressed\ngreat indignation at the imposture of the Cock Lane Ghost, and\nrelated with much satisfaction how he had assisted in detecting the\ncheat, and had published an account of it in the newspapers\".\n\nThey will next believe (if they be, in the words of Captain Bobadil,\n\"so generously minded\") in the transatlantic trance-speakers \"who\nprofessed to speak from direct inspiration\", Mrs. Cora Hatch, Mrs.\nHenderson, and Miss Emma Hardinge; and they will believe in those\neminent ladies having \"spoken on Sundays to five hundred thousand\nhearers\"--small audiences, by the way, compared with the intelligent\nconcourse recently assembled in the city of New York, to do honour\nto the Nuptials of General the Honourable T. Barnum Thumb.  At about\nthis stage of their spiritual education they may take the\nopportunity of believing in \"letters from a distinguished gentleman\nof New York, in which the frequent appearance of the gentleman\'s\ndeceased wife and of Dr. Franklin, to him and other well-known\nfriends, are unquestionably unequalled in the annals of the\nmarvellous\".  Why these modest appearances should seem at all out of\nthe common way to Mr. Howitt (who would be in a state of flaming\nindignation if we thought them so), we could not imagine, until we\nfound on reading further, \"it is solemnly stated that the witnesses\nhave not only seen but touched these spirits, and handled the\nclothes and hair of Franklin\".  Without presuming to go Mr. Howitt\'s\nlength of considering this by any means a marvellous experience, we\nyet venture to confess that it has awakened in our mind many\ninteresting speculations touching the present whereabout in space,\nof the spirits of Mr. Howitt\'s own departed boots and hats.\n\nThe next articles of belief are Belief in the moderate figures of\n\"thirty thousand media in the United States in 1853\"; and in two\nmillion five hundred thousand spiritualists in the same country of\ncomposed minds, in 1855, \"professing to have arrived at their\nconvictions of spiritual communication from personal experience\";\nand in \"an average rate of increase of three hundred thousand per\nannum\", still in the same country of calm philosophers.  Belief in\nspiritual knockings, in all manner of American places, and, among\nothers, in the house of \"a Doctor Phelps at Stratford, Connecticut,\na man of the highest character for intelligence\", says Mr. Howitt,\nand to whom we willingly concede the possession of far higher\nintelligence than was displayed by his spiritual knocker, in\n\"frequently cutting to pieces the clothes of one of his boys\", and\nin breaking \"seventy-one panes of glass\"--unless, indeed, the\nknocker, when in the body, was connected with the tailoring and\nglazing interests.  Belief in immaterial performers playing (in the\ndark though:  they are obstinate about its being in the dark) on\nmaterial instruments of wood, catgut, brass, tin, and parchment.\nYour belief is further requested in \"the Kentucky Jerks\".  The\nspiritual achievements thus euphoniously denominated \"appear\", says\nMr. Howitt, \"to have been of a very disorderly kind\".  It appears\nthat a certain Mr. Doke, a Presbyterian clergyman, \"was first seized\nby the jerks\", and the jerks laid hold of Mr. Doke in that\nunclerical way and with that scant respect for his cloth, that they\n\"twitched him about in a most extraordinary manner, often when in\nthe pulpit, and caused him to shout aloud, and run out of the pulpit\ninto the woods, screaming like a madman.  When the fit was over, he\nreturned calmly to his pulpit and finished the service.\"  The\ncongregation having waited, we presume, and edified themselves with\nthe distant bellowings of Doke in the woods, until he came back\nagain, a little warm and hoarse, but otherwise in fine condition.\n\"People were often seized at hotels, and at table would, on lifting\na glass to drink, jerk the liquor to the ceiling; ladies would at\nthe breakfast-table suddenly be compelled to throw aloft their\ncoffee, and frequently break the cup and saucer.\"  A certain\nventuresome clergyman vowed that he would preach down the Jerks,\n\"but he was seized in the midst of his attempt, and made so\nridiculous that he withdrew himself from further notice\"--an example\nmuch to be commended.  That same favoured land of America has been\nparticularly favoured in the development of \"innumerable mediums\",\nand Mr. Howitt orders you to believe in Daniel Dunglas Home, Andrew\nDavis Jackson, and Thomas L. Harris, as \"the three most remarkable,\nor most familiar, on this side of the Atlantic\".  Concerning Mr.\nHome, the articles of belief (besides removal of furniture) are,\nThat through him raps have been given and communications made from\ndeceased friends.  That \"his hand has been seized by spirit\ninfluence, and rapid communications written out, of a surprising\ncharacter to those to whom they were addressed\".  That at his\nbidding, \"spirit hands have appeared which have been seen, felt, and\nrecognised frequently, by persons present, as those of deceased\nfriends\".  That he has been frequently lifted up and carried,\nfloating \"as it were\" through a room, near the ceiling.  That in\nAmerica, \"all these phenomena have displayed themselves in greater\nforce than here\"--which we have not the slightest doubt of.  That he\nis \"the planter of spiritualism all over Europe\".  That \"by\ncircumstances that no man could have devised, he became the guest of\nthe Emperor of the French, of the King of Holland, of the Czar of\nRussia, and of many lesser princes\".  That he returned from \"this\nunpremeditated missionary tour\", \"endowed with competence\"; but not\nbefore, \"at the Tuileries, on one occasion when the emperor,\nempress, a distinguished lady, and himself only were sitting at\ntable, a hand appeared, took up a pen, and wrote, in a strong and\nwell-known character, the word Napoleon.  The hand was then\nsuccessively presented to the several personages of the party to\nkiss.\"  The stout believer, having disposed of Mr. Home, and rested\na little, will then proceed to believe in Andrew Davis Jackson, or\nAndrew Jackson Davis (Mr. Howitt, having no Medium at hand to settle\nthis difference and reveal the right name of the seer, calls him by\nboth names), who merely \"beheld all the essential natures of things,\nsaw the interior of men and animals, as perfectly as their exterior;\nand described them in language so correct, that the most able\ntechnologists could not surpass him.  He pointed out the proper\nremedies for all the complaints, and the shops where they were to be\nobtained\";--in the latter respect appearing to hail from an\nadvertising circle, as we conceive.  It was also in this gentleman\'s\nlimited department to \"see the metals in the earth\", and to have\n\"the most distant regions and their various productions present\nbefore him\".  Having despatched this tough case, the believer will\npass on to Thomas L. Harris, and will swallow HIM easily, together\nwith \"whole epics\" of his composition; a certain work \"of scarcely\nless than Miltonic grandeur\", called The Lyric of the Golden Age--a\nlyric pretty nigh as long as one of Mr. Howitt\'s volumes--dictated\nby Mr. (not Mrs.) Harris to the publisher in ninety-four hours; and\nseveral extempore sermons, possessing the remarkably lucid property\nof being \"full, unforced, out-gushing, unstinted, and absorbing\".\nThe candidate for examination in pure belief, will then pass on to\nthe spirit-photography department; this, again, will be found in so-\nfavoured America, under the superintendence of Medium Mumler, a\nphotographer of Boston:  who was \"astonished\" (though, on Mr.\nHowitt\'s showing, he surely ought not to have been) \"on taking a\nphotograph of himself, to find also by his side the figure of a\nyoung girl, which he immediately recognised as that of a deceased\nrelative.  The circumstance made a great excitement.  Numbers of\npersons rushed to his rooms, and many have found deceased friends\nphotographed with themselves.\"  (Perhaps Mr. Mumler, too, may become\n\"endowed with competence\" in time.  Who knows?)  Finally, the true\nbelievers in the gospel according to Howitt, have, besides, but to\npin their faith on \"ladies who see spirits habitually\", on ladies\nwho KNOW they have a tendency to soar in the air on sufficient\nprovocation, and on a few other gnats to be taken after their\ncamels, and they shall be pronounced by Mr. Howitt not of the\nstereotyped class of minds, and not partakers of \"the astonishing\nignorance of the press\", and shall receive a first-class certificate\nof merit.\n\nBut before they pass through this portal into the Temple of Serene\nWisdom, we, halting blind and helpless on the steps, beg to suggest\nto them what they must at once and for ever disbelieve.  They must\ndisbelieve that in the dark times, when very few were versed in what\nare now the mere recreations of Science, and when those few formed a\npriesthood-class apart, any marvels were wrought by the aid of\nconcave mirrors and a knowledge of the properties of certain odours\nand gases, although the self-same marvels could be reproduced before\ntheir eyes at the Polytechnic Institution, Regent Street, London,\nany day in the year.  They must by no means believe that Conjuring\nand Ventriloquism are old trades.  They must disbelieve all\nPhilosophical Transactions containing the records of painful and\ncareful inquiry into now familiar disorders of the senses of seeing\nand hearing, and into the wonders of somnambulism, epilepsy,\nhysteria, miasmatic influence, vegetable poisons derived by whole\ncommunities from corrupted air, diseased imitation, and moral\ninfection.  They must disbelieve all such awkward leading cases as\nthe case of the Woodstock Commissioners and their man, and the case\nof the Identity of the Stockwell Ghost, with the maid-servant.  They\nmust disbelieve the vanishing of champion haunted houses (except,\nindeed, out of Mr. Howitt\'s book), represented to have been closed\nand ruined for years, before one day\'s inquiry by four gentlemen\nassociated with this journal, and one hour\'s reference to the Local\nRate-books.  They must disbelieve all possibility of a human\ncreature on the last verge of the dark bridge from Life to Death,\nbeing mysteriously able, in occasional cases, so to influence the\nmind of one very near and dear, as vividly to impress that mind with\nsome disturbed sense of the solemn change impending.  They must\ndisbelieve the possibility of the lawful existence of a class of\nintellects which, humbly conscious of the illimitable power of GOD\nand of their own weakness and ignorance, never deny that He can\ncause the souls of the dead to revisit the earth, or that He may\nhave caused the souls of the dead to revisit the earth, or that He\ncan cause any awful or wondrous thing to be; but to deny the\nlikelihood of apparitions or spirits coming here upon the stupidest\nof bootless errands, and producing credentials tantamount to a\nsolicitation of our vote and interest and next proxy, to get them\ninto the Asylum for Idiots.  They must disbelieve the right of\nChristian people who do NOT protest against Protestantism, but who\nhold it to be a barrier against the darkest superstitions that can\nenslave the soul, to guard with jealousy all approaches tending down\nto Cock Lane Ghosts and suchlike infamous swindles, widely degrading\nwhen widely believed in; and they must disbelieve that such people\nhave the right to know, and that it is their duty to know, wonder-\nworkers by their fruits, and to test miracle-mongers by the tests of\nprobability, analogy, and common sense.  They must disbelieve all\nrational explanations of thoroughly proved experiences (only) which\nappear supernatural, derived from the average experience and study\nof the visible world.  They must disbelieve the speciality of the\nMaster and the Disciples, and that it is a monstrosity to test the\nwonders of show-folk by the same touchstone.  Lastly, they must\ndisbelieve that one of the best accredited chapters in the history\nof mankind is the chapter that records the astonishing deceits\ncontinually practised, with no object or purpose but the distorted\npleasure of deceiving.\n\nWe have summed up a few--not nearly all--of the articles of belief\nand disbelief to which Mr. Howitt most arrogantly demands an\nimplicit adherence.  To uphold these, he uses a book as a Clown in a\nPantomime does, and knocks everybody on the head with it who comes\nin his way.  Moreover, he is an angrier personage than the Clown,\nand does not experimentally try the effect of his red-hot poker on\nyour shins, but straightway runs you through the body and soul with\nit.  He is always raging to tell you that if you are not Howitt, you\nare Atheist and Anti-Christ.  He is the sans-culotte of the\nSpiritual Revolution, and will not hear of your accepting this point\nand rejecting that;--down your throat with them all, one and\nindivisible, at the point of the pike; No Liberty, Totality,\nFraternity, or Death!\n\nWithout presuming to question that \"it is high time to protest\nagainst Protestantism\" on such very substantial grounds as Mr.\nHowitt sets forth, we do presume to think that it is high time to\nprotest against Mr. Howitt\'s spiritualism, as being a little in\nexcess of the peculiar merit of Thomas L. Harris\'s sermons, and\nsomewhat TOO \"full, out-gushing, unstinted, and absorbing\".\n\n\n\nTHE MARTYR MEDIUM\n\n\n\n\"After the valets, the master!\" is Mr. Fechter\'s rallying cry in the\npicturesque romantic drama which attracts all London to the Lyceum\nTheatre.  After the worshippers and puffers of Mr. Daniel Dunglas\nHome, the spirit medium, comes Mr. Daniel Dunglas Home himself, in\none volume.  And we must, for the honour of Literature, plainly\nexpress our great surprise and regret that he comes arm-in-arm with\nsuch good company as Messrs. Longman and Company.\n\nWe have already summed up Mr. Home\'s demands on the public capacity\nof swallowing, as sounded through the war-denouncing trumpet of Mr.\nHowitt, and it is not our intention to revive the strain as\nperformed by Mr. Home on his own melodious instrument.  We notice,\nby the way, that in that part of the Fantasia where the hand of the\nfirst Napoleon is supposed to be reproduced, recognised, and kissed,\nat the Tuileries, Mr. Home subdues the florid effects one might have\nexpected after Mr. Howitt\'s execution, and brays in an extremely\ngeneral manner.  And yet we observe Mr. Home to be in other things\nvery reliant on Mr. Howitt, of whom he entertains as gratifying an\nopinion as Mr. Howitt entertains of him:  dwelling on his \"deep\nresearches into this subject\", and of his \"great work now ready for\nthe press\", and of his \"eloquent and forcible\" advocacy, and eke of\nhis \"elaborate and almost exhaustive work\", which Mr. Home trusts\nwill be \"extensively read\".  But, indeed, it would seem to be the\nmost reliable characteristic of the Dear Spirits, though very\ncapricious in other particulars, that they always form their circles\ninto what may be described, in worldly terms, as A Mutual Admiration\nand Complimentation Company (Limited).\n\nMr. Home\'s book is entitled Incidents in My Life.  We will extract a\ndozen sample passages from it, as variations on and phrases of\nharmony in, the general strain for the Trumpet, which we have\npromised not to repeat.\n\n\n1.  MR. HOME IS SUPERNATURALLY NURSED\n\n\n\"I cannot remember when first I became subject to the curious\nphenomena which have now for so long attended me, but my aunt and\nothers have told me that when I was a baby my cradle was frequently\nrocked, as if some kind guardian spirit was attending me in my\nslumbers.\"\n\n\n2.  DISRESPECTFUL CONDUCT OF MR. HOME\'S AUNT NEVERTHELESS\n\n\n\"In her uncontrollable anger she seized a chair and threw it at me.\"\n\n\n3.  PUNISHMENT OF MR. HOME\'S AUNT\n\n\n\"Upon one occasion as the table was being thus moved about of\nitself, my aunt brought the family Bible, and placing it on the\ntable, said, \'There, that will soon drive the devils away\'; but to\nher astonishment the table only moved in a more lively manner, as if\npleased to bear such a burden.\"  (We believe this is constantly\nobserved in pulpits and church reading desks, which are invariably\nlively.)  \"Seeing this she was greatly incensed, and determined to\nstop it, she angrily placed her whole weight on the table, and was\nactually lifted up with it bodily from the floor.\"\n\n\n4. TRIUMPHANT EFFECT OF THIS DISCIPLINE ON MR. HOME\'S AUNT\n\n\n\"And she felt it a duty that I should leave her house, and which I\ndid.\"\n\n\n5.  MR. HOME\'S MISSION\n\n\nIt was communicated to him by the spirit of his mother, in the\nfollowing terms:  \"Daniel, fear not, my child, God is with you, and\nwho shall be against you?  Seek to do good:  be truthful and truth-\nloving, and you will prosper, my child.  Yours is a glorious\nmission--you will convince the infidel, cure the sick, and console\nthe weeping.\"  It is a coincidence that another eminent man, with\nseveral missions, heard a voice from the Heavens blessing him, when\nhe also was a youth, and saying, \"You will be rewarded, my son, in\ntime\".  This Medium was the celebrated Baron Munchausen, who relates\nthe experience in the opening of the second chapter of the incidents\nin HIS life.\n\n\n6.  MODEST SUCCESS OF MR. HOME\'S MISSION\n\n\n\"Certainly these phenomena, whether from God or from the devil, have\nin ten years caused more converts to the great truths of immortality\nand angel communion, with all that flows from these great facts,\nthan all the sects in Christendom have made during the same period.\"\n\n\n7.  WHAT THE FIRST COMPOSERS SAY OF THE SPIRIT-MUSIC, TO MR. HOME\n\n\n\"As to the music, it has been my good fortune to be on intimate\nterms with some of the first composers of the day, and more than one\nof them have said of such as they have heard, that it is such music\nas only angels could make, and no man could write it.\"\n\nThese \"first composers\" are not more particularly named.  We shall\ntherefore be happy to receive and file at the office of this\nJournal, the testimonials in the foregoing terms of Dr. Sterndale\nBennett, Mr. Balfe, Mr. Macfarren, Mr. Benedict, Mr. Vincent\nWallace, Signor Costa, M. Auber, M. Gounod, Signor Rossini, and\nSignor Verdi.  We shall also feel obliged to Mr. Alfred Mellon, who\nis no doubt constantly studying this wonderful music, under the\nMedium\'s auspices, if he will note on paper, from memory, say a\nsingle sheet of the same.  Signor Giulio Regondi will then perform\nit, as correctly as a mere mortal can, on the Accordion, at the next\nensuing concert of the Philharmonic Society; on which occasion the\nbefore-mentioned testimonials will be conspicuously displayed in the\nfront of the orchestra.\n\n\n8.  MR. HOME\'S MIRACULOUS INFANT\n\n\n\"On the 26th April, old style, or 8th May, according to our style,\nat seven in the evening, and as the snow was fast falling, our\nlittle boy was born at the town house, situate on the Gagarines\nQuay, in St. Petersburg, where we were still staying.  A few hours\nafter his birth, his mother, the nurse, and I heard for several\nhours the warbling of a bird as if singing over him.  Also that\nnight, and for two or three nights afterwards, a bright starlike\nlight, which was clearly visible from the partial darkness of the\nroom, in which there was only a night-lamp burning, appeared several\ntimes directly I over its head, where it remained for some moments,\nand then slowly moved in the direction of the door, where it\ndisappeared.  This was also seen by each of us at the same time.\nThe light was more condensed than those which have been so often\nseen in my presence upon previous and subsequent occasions.  It was\nbrighter and more distinctly globular.  I do not believe that it\ncame through my mediumship, but rather through that of the child,\nwho has manifested on several occasions the presence of the gift.  I\ndo not like to allude to such a matter, but as there are more\nstrange things in Heaven and earth than are dreamt of, even in my\nphilosophy, I do not feel myself at liberty to omit stating, that\nduring the latter part of my wife\'s pregnancy, we thought it better\nthat she should not join in Seances, because it was found that\nwhenever the rappings occurred in the room, a simultaneous movement\nof the child was distinctly felt, perfectly in unison with the\nsounds.  When there were three sounds, three movements were felt,\nand so on, and when five sounds were heard, which is generally the\ncall for the alphabet, she felt the five internal movements, and she\nwould frequently, when we were mistaken in the latter, correct us\nfrom what the child indicated.\"\n\nWe should ask pardon of our readers for sullying our paper with this\nnauseous matter, if without it they could adequately understand what\nMr. Home\'s book is.\n\n\n9.  CAGLIOSTRO\'S SPIRIT CALLS ON MR. HOME\n\n\nPrudently avoiding the disagreeable question of his giving himself,\nboth in this state of existence and in his spiritual circle, a name\nto which he never had any pretensions whatever, and likewise\nprudently suppressing any reference to his amiable weakness as a\nswindler and an infamous trafficker in his own wife, the guileless\nMr. Balsamo delivered, in a \"distinct voice\", this distinct\ncelestial utterance--unquestionably punctuated in a supernatural\nmanner:  \"My power was that of a mesmerist, but all-misunderstood by\nthose about me, my biographers have even done me injustice, but I\ncare not for the untruths of earth\".\n\n\n10.  ORACULAR STATE OF MR. HOME\n\n\n\"After various manifestations, Mr. Home went into the trance, and\naddressing a person present, said, \'You ask what good are such\ntrivial manifestations, such as rapping, table-moving, etc.?  God is\na better judge than we are what is fitted for humanity, immense\nresults may spring from trivial things.  The steam from a kettle is\na small thing, but look at the locomotive!  The electric spark from\nthe back of a cat is a small thing, but see the wonders of\nelectricity!  The raps are small things, but their results will lead\nyou to the Spirit-World, and to eternity!  Why should great results\nspring from such small causes?  Christ was born in a manger, he was\nnot born a King.  When you tell me why he was born in a manger, I\nwill tell you why these manifestations, so trivial, so undignified\nas they appear to you, have been appointed to convince the world of\nthe truth of spiritualism.\'\"\n\nWonderful!  Clearly direct Inspiration!--And yet, perhaps, hardly\nworth the trouble of going \"into the trance\" for, either.  Amazing\nas the revelation is, we seem to have heard something like it from\nmore than one personage who was wide awake.  A quack doctor, in an\nopen barouche (attended by a barrel-organ and two footmen in brass\nhelmets), delivered just such another address within our hearing,\noutside a gate of Paris, not two months ago.\n\n\n11.  THE TESTIMONY OF MR. HOME\'S BOOTS\n\n\n\"The lady of the house turned to me and said abruptly, \'Why, you are\nsitting in the air\'; and on looking, we found that the chair\nremained in its place, but that I was elevated two or three inches\nabove it, and my feet not touching the floor.  This may show how\nutterly unconscious I am at times to the sensation of levitation.\nAs is usual, when I had not got above the level of the heads of\nthose about me, and when they change their position much--as they\nfrequently do in looking wistfully at such a phenomenon--I came down\nagain, but not till I had remained so raised about half a minute\nfrom the time of its being first seen.  I was now impressed to leave\nthe table, and was soon carried to the lofty ceiling.  The Count de\nB- left his place at the table, and coming under where I was, said,\n\'Now, young Home, come and let me touch your feet.\'  I told him I\nhad no volition in the matter, but perhaps the spirits would kindly\nallow me to come down to him.  They did so, by floating me down to\nhim, and my feet were soon in his outstretched hands.  He seized my\nboots, and now I was again elevated, he holding tightly, and pulling\nat my feet, till the boots I wore, which had elastic sides, came off\nand remained in his hands.\"\n\n\n12.  THE UNCOMBATIVE NATURE OF MR. HOME\n\n\nAs there is a maudlin complaint in this book, about men of Science\nbeing hard upon \"the \'Orphan\' Home\", and as the \"gentle and\nuncombative nature\" of this Medium in a martyred point of view is\npathetically commented on by the anonymous literary friend who\nsupplies him with an introduction and appendix--rather at odds with\nMr. Howitt, who is so mightily triumphant about the same Martyr\'s\nreception by crowned heads, and about the competence he has become\nendowed with--we cull from Mr. Home\'s book one or two little\nillustrative flowers.  Sir David Brewster (a pestilent unbeliever)\n\"has come before the public in few matters which have brought more\nshame upon him than his conduct and assertions on this occasion, in\nwhich he manifested not only a disregard for truth, but also a\ndisloyalty to scientific observation, and to the use of his own\neyesight and natural faculties\".  The same unhappy Sir David\nBrewster\'s \"character may be the better known, not only for his\nuntruthful dealing with this subject, but also in his own domain of\nscience in which the same unfaithfulness to truth will be seen to be\nthe characteristic of his mind\".  Again, he \"is really not a man\nover whom victory is any honour\".  Again, \"not only he, but\nProfessor Faraday have had time and ample leisure to regret that\nthey should have so foolishly pledged themselves\", etc.  A Faraday a\nfool in the sight of a Home!  That unjust judge and whited wall,\nLord Brougham, has his share of this Martyr Medium\'s\nuncombativeness.  \"In order that he might not be compelled to deny\nSir David\'s statements, he found it necessary that he should be\nsilent, and I have some reason to complain that his Lordship\npreferred sacrificing me to his desire not to immolate his friend.\"\nM. Arago also came off with very doubtful honours from a wrestle\nwith the uncombative Martyr; who is perfectly clear (and so are we,\nlet us add) that scientific men are not the men for his purpose.  Of\ncourse, he is the butt of \"utter and acknowledged ignorance\", and of\n\"the most gross and foolish statements\", and of \"the unjust and\ndishonest\", and of \"the press-gang\", and of crowds of other alien\nand combative adjectives, participles, and substantives.\n\nNothing is without its use, and even this odious book may do some\nservice.  Not because it coolly claims for the writer and his\ndisciples such powers as were wielded by the Saviour and the\nApostles; not because it sees no difference between twelve table\nrappers in these days, and \"twelve fishermen\" in those; not because\nit appeals for precedents to statements extracted from the most\nignorant and wretched of mankind, by cruel torture, and constantly\nwithdrawn when the torture was withdrawn; not because it sets forth\nsuch a strange confusion of ideas as is presented by one of the\nfaithful when, writing of a certain sprig of geranium handed by an\ninvisible hand, he adds in ecstasies, \"WHICH WE HAVE PLANTED AND IT\nIS GROWING, SO THAT IT IS NO DELUSION, NO FAIRY MONEY TURNED INTO\nDROSS OR LEAVES\"--as if it followed that the conjuror\'s half-crowns\nreally did become invisible and in that state fly, because he\nafterwards cuts them out of a real orange; or as if the conjuror\'s\npigeon, being after the discharge of his gun, a real live pigeon\nfluttering on the target, must therefore conclusively be a pigeon,\nfired, whole, living and unshattered, out of the gun!--not because\nof the exposure of any of these weaknesses, or a thousand such, are\nthese moving incidents in the life of the Martyr Medium, and similar\nproductions, likely to prove useful, but because of their uniform\nabuse of those who go to test the reality of these alleged\nphenomena, and who come away incredulous.  There is an old homely\nproverb concerning pitch and its adhesive character, which we hope\nthis significant circumstance may impress on many minds.  The writer\nof these lines has lately heard overmuch touching young men of\npromise in the imaginative arts, \"towards whom\" Martyr Mediums\nassisting at evening parties feel themselves \"drawn\".  It may be a\nhint to such young men to stick to their own drawing, as being of a\nmuch better kind, and to leave Martyr Mediums alone in their glory.\n\nAs there is a good deal in these books about \"lying spirits\", we\nwill conclude by putting a hypothetical case.  Supposing that a\nMedium (Martyr or otherwise) were established for a time in the\nhouse of an English gentleman abroad; say, somewhere in Italy.\nSupposing that the more marvellous the Medium became, the more\nsuspicious of him the lady of the house became.  Supposing that the\nlady, her distrust once aroused, were particularly struck by the\nMedium\'s exhibiting a persistent desire to commit her, somehow or\nother, to the disclosure of the manner of the death, to him unknown,\nof a certain person.  Supposing that she at length resolved to test\nthe Medium on this head, and, therefore, on a certain evening\nmentioned a wholly supposititious manner of death (which was not the\nreal manner of death, nor anything at all like it) within the range\nof his listening ears.  And supposing that a spirit presently\nafterwards rapped out its presence, claiming to be the spirit of\nthat deceased person, and claiming to have departed this life in\nthat supposititious way.  Would that be a lying spirit?  Or would it\nhe a something else, tainting all that Medium\'s statements and\nsuppressions, even if they were not in themselves of a manifestly\noutrageous character?\n\n\n\nTHE LATE MR. STANFIELD\n\n\n\nEvery Artist, be he writer, painter, musician, or actor, must bear\nhis private sorrows as he best can, and must separate them from the\nexercise of his public pursuit.  But it sometimes happens, in\ncompensation, that his private loss of a dear friend represents a\nloss on the part of the whole community.  Then he may, without\nobtrusion of his individuality, step forth to lay his little wreath\nupon that dear friend\'s grave.\n\nOn Saturday, the eighteenth of this present month, Clarkson\nStanfield died.  On the afternoon of that day, England lost the\ngreat marine painter of whom she will be boastful ages hence; the\nNational Historian of her speciality, the Sea; the man famous in all\ncountries for his marvellous rendering of the waves that break upon\nher shores, of her ships and seamen, of her coasts and skies, of her\nstorms and sunshine, of the many marvels of the deep.  He who holds\nthe oceans in the hollow of His hand had given, associated with\nthem, wonderful gifts into his keeping; he had used them well\nthrough threescore and fourteen years; and, on the afternoon of that\nspring day, relinquished them for ever.\n\nIt is superfluous to record that the painter of \"The Battle of\nTrafalgar\", of the \"Victory being towed into Gibraltar with the body\nof Nelson on Board\", of \"The Morning after the Wreck\", of \"The\nAbandoned\", of fifty more such works, died in his seventy-fourth\nyear, \"Mr.\" Stanfield.--He was an Englishman.\n\nThose grand pictures will proclaim his powers while paint and canvas\nlast.  But the writer of these words had been his friend for thirty\nyears; and when, a short week or two before his death, he laid that\nonce so skilful hand upon the writer\'s breast and told him they\nwould meet again, \"but not here\", the thoughts of the latter turned,\nfor the time, so little to his noble genius, and so much to his\nnoble nature!\n\nHe was the soul of frankness, generosity, and simplicity.  The most\ngenial, the most affectionate, the most loving, and the most lovable\nof men.  Success had never for an instant spoiled him.  His interest\nin the Theatre as an Institution--the best picturesqueness of which\nmay be said to be wholly due to him--was faithful to the last.  His\nbelief in a Play, his delight in one, the ease with which it moved\nhim to tears or to laughter, were most remarkable evidences of the\nheart he must have put into his old theatrical work, and of the\nthorough purpose and sincerity with which it must have been done.\nThe writer was very intimately associated with him in some amateur\nplays; and day after day, and night after night, there were the same\nunquenchable freshness, enthusiasm, and impressibility in him,\nthough broken in health, even then.\n\nNo Artist can ever have stood by his art with a quieter dignity than\nhe always did.  Nothing would have induced him to lay it at the feet\nof any human creature.  To fawn, or to toady, or to do undeserved\nhomage to any one, was an absolute impossibility with him.  And yet\nhis character was so nicely balanced that he was the last man in the\nworld to be suspected of self-assertion, and his modesty was one of\nhis most special qualities.\n\nHe was a charitable, religious, gentle, truly good man.  A genuine\nman, incapable of pretence or of concealment.  He had been a sailor\nonce; and all the best characteristics that are popularly attributed\nto sailors, being his, and being in him refined by the influences of\nhis Art, formed a whole not likely to be often seen.  There is no\nsmile that the writer can recall, like his; no manner so naturally\nconfiding and so cheerfully engaging.  When the writer saw him for\nthe last time on earth, the smile and the manner shone out once\nthrough the weakness, still:  the bright unchanging Soul within the\naltered face and form.\n\nNo man was ever held in higher respect by his friends, and yet his\nintimate friends invariably addressed him and spoke of him by a pet\nname.  It may need, perhaps, the writer\'s memory and associations to\nfind in this a touching expression of his winning character, his\nplayful smile, and pleasant ways.  \"You know Mrs. Inchbald\'s story,\nNature and Art?\" wrote Thomas Hood, once, in a letter:  \"What a fine\nEdition of Nature and Art is Stanfield!\"\n\nGone!  And many and many a dear old day gone with him!  But their\nmemories remain.  And his memory will not soon fade out, for he has\nset his mark upon the restless waters, and his fame will long be\nsounded in the roar of the sea.\n\n\n\nA SLIGHT QUESTION OF FACT\n\n\n\nIt is never well for the public interest that the originator of any\nsocial reform should be soon forgotten.  Further, it is neither\nwholesome nor right (being neither generous nor just) that the merit\nof his work should be gradually transferred elsewhere.\n\nSome few weeks ago, our contemporary, the Pall Mall Gazette, in\ncertain strictures on our Theatres which we are very far indeed from\nchallenging, remarked on the first effectual discouragement of an\noutrage upon decency which the lobbies and upper-boxes of even our\nbest Theatres habitually paraded within the last twenty or thirty\nyears.  From those remarks it might appear as though no such Manager\nof Covent Garden or Drury Lane as Mr. Macready had ever existed.\n\nIt is a fact beyond all possibility of question, that Mr. Macready,\non assuming the management of Covent Garden Theatre in 1837, did\ninstantly set himself, regardless of precedent and custom down to\nthat hour obtaining, rigidly to suppress this shameful thing, and\ndid rigidly suppress and crush it during his whole management of\nthat theatre, and during his whole subsequent management of Drury\nLane.  That he did so, as certainly without favour as without fear;\nthat he did so, against his own immediate interests; that he did so,\nagainst vexations and oppositions which might have cooled the ardour\nof a less earnest man, or a less devoted artist; can be better known\nto no one than the writer of the present words, whose name stands at\nthe head of these pages.\n\n\n\nLANDOR\'S LIFE\n\n\n\nPrefixed to the second volume of Mr. Forster\'s admirable biography\nof Walter Savage Landor, {1} is an engraving from a portrait of that\nremarkable man when seventy-seven years of age, by Boxall.  The\nwriter of these lines can testify that the original picture is a\nsingularly good likeness, the result of close and subtle observation\non the part of the painter; but, for this very reason, the engraving\ngives a most inadequate idea of the merit of the picture and the\ncharacter of the man.\n\nFrom the engraving, the arms and hands are omitted.  In the picture,\nthey are, as they were in nature, indispensable to a correct reading\nof the vigorous face.  The arms were very peculiar.  They were\nrather short, and were curiously restrained and checked in their\naction at the elbows; in the action of the hands, even when\nseparately clenched, there was the same kind of pause, and a\nnoticeable tendency to relaxation on the part of the thumb.  Let the\nface be never so intense or fierce, there was a commentary of\ngentleness in the hands, essential to be taken along with it.  Like\nHamlet, Landor would speak daggers, but use none.  In the expression\nof his hands, though angrily closed, there was always gentleness and\ntenderness; just as when they were open, and the handsome old\ngentleman would wave them with a little courtly flourish that sat\nwell upon him, as he recalled some classic compliment that he had\nrendered to some reigning Beauty, there was a chivalrous grace about\nthem such as pervades his softer verses.  Thus the fictitious Mr.\nBoythorn (to whom we may refer without impropriety in this\nconnexion, as Mr. Forster does) declaims \"with unimaginable energy\"\nthe while his bird is \"perched upon his thumb\", and he \"softly\nsmooths its feathers with his forefinger\".\n\nFrom the spirit of Mr. Forster\'s Biography these characteristic\nhands are never omitted, and hence (apart from its literary merits)\nits great value.  As the same masterly writer\'s Life and Times of\nOliver Goldsmith is a generous and yet conscientious picture of a\nperiod, so this is a not less generous and yet conscientious picture\nof one life; of a life, with all its aspirations, achievements, and\ndisappointments; all its capabilities, opportunities, and\nirretrievable mistakes.  It is essentially a sad book, and herein\nlies proof of its truth and worth.  The life of almost any man\npossessing great gifts, would be a sad book to himself; and this\nbook enables us not only to see its subject, but to be its subject,\nif we will.\n\nMr. Forster is of opinion that \"Landor\'s fame very surely awaits\nhim\".  This point admitted or doubted, the value of the book remains\nthe same.  It needs not to know his works (otherwise than through\nhis biographer\'s exposition), it needs not to have known himself, to\nfind a deep interest in these pages.  More or less of their warning\nis in every conscience; and some admiration of a fine genius, and of\na great, wild, generous nature, incapable of mean self-extenuation\nor dissimulation--if unhappily incapable of self-repression too--\nshould be in every breast.  \"There may be still living many\npersons\", Walter Landor\'s brother, Robert, writes to Mr. Forster of\nthis book, \"who would contradict any narrative of yours in which the\nbest qualities were remembered, the worst forgotten.\"  Mr. Forster\'s\ncomment is:  \"I had not waited for this appeal to resolve, that, if\nthis memoir were written at all, it should contain, as far as might\nlie within my power, a fair statement of the truth\".  And this\neloquent passage of truth immediately follows:  \"Few of his\ninfirmities are without something kindly or generous about them; and\nwe are not long in discovering there is nothing so wildly incredible\nthat he will not himself in perfect good faith believe.  When he\npublished his first book of poems on quitting Oxford, the profits\nwere to be reserved for a distressed clergyman.  When he published\nhis Latin poems, the poor of Leipzig were to have the sum they\nrealised.  When his comedy was ready to be acted, a Spaniard who had\nsheltered him at Castro was to be made richer by it.  When he\ncompeted for the prize of the Academy of Stockholm, it was to go to\nthe poor of Sweden.  If nobody got anything from any one of these\nenterprises, the fault at all events was not his.  With his\nextraordinary power of forgetting disappointments, he was prepared\nat each successive failure to start afresh, as if each had been a\ntriumph.  I shall have to delineate this peculiarity as strongly in\nthe last half as in the first half of his life, and it was certainly\nan amiable one.  He was ready at all times to set aside, out of his\nown possessions, something for somebody who might please him for the\ntime; and when frailties of temper and tongue are noted, this other\neccentricity should not be omitted.  He desired eagerly the love as\nwell as the good opinion of those whom for the time he esteemed, and\nno one was more affectionate while under such influences.  It is not\na small virtue to feel such genuine pleasure, as he always did in\ngiving and receiving pleasure.  His generosity, too, was bestowed\nchiefly on those who could make small acknowledgment in thanks and\nno return in kind.\"\n\nSome of his earlier contemporaries may have thought him a vain man.\nMost assuredly he was not, in the common acceptation of the term.  A\nvain man has little or no admiration to bestow upon competitors.\nLandor had an inexhaustible fund.  He thought well of his writings,\nor he would not have preserved them.  He said and wrote that he\nthought well of them, because that was his mind about them, and he\nsaid and wrote his mind.  He was one of the few men of whom you\nmight always know the whole:  of whom you might always know the\nworst, as well as the best.  He had no reservations or duplicities.\n\"No, by Heaven!\" he would say (\"with unimaginable energy\"), if any\ngood adjective were coupled with him which he did not deserve:  \"I\nam nothing of the kind.  I wish I were; but I don\'t deserve the\nattribute, and I never did, and I never shall!\"  His intense\nconsciousness of himself never led to his poorly excusing himself,\nand seldom to his violently asserting himself.  When he told some\nlittle story of his bygone social experiences, in Florence, or where\nnot, as he was fond of doing, it took the innocent form of making\nall the interlocutors, Landors.  It was observable, too, that they\nalways called him \"Mr. Landor\"--rather ceremoniously and\nsubmissively.  There was a certain \"Caro Pedre Abete Marina\"--\ninvariably so addressed in these anecdotes--who figured through a\ngreat many of them, and who always expressed himself in this\ndeferential tone.\n\nMr. Forster writes of Landor\'s character thus:\n\n\n\"A man must be judged, at first, by what he says and does.  But with\nhim such extravagance as I have referred to was little more than the\nhabitual indulgence (on such themes) of passionate feelings and\nlanguage, indecent indeed but utterly purposeless; the mere\nexplosion of wrath provoked by tyranny or cruelty; the\nirregularities of an overheated steam-engine too weak for its own\nvapour.  It is very certain that no one could detest oppression more\ntruly than Landor did in all seasons and times; and if no one\nexpressed that scorn, that abhorrence of tyranny and fraud, more\nhastily or more intemperately, all his fire and fury signified\nreally little else than ill-temper too easily provoked.  Not to\njustify or excuse such language, but to explain it, this\nconsideration is urged.  If not uniformly placable, Landor was\nalways compassionate.  He was tender-hearted rather than bloody-\nminded at all times, and upon only the most partial acquaintance\nwith his writings could other opinion be formed.  A completer\nknowledge of them would satisfy any one that he had as little real\ndisposition to kill a king as to kill a mouse.  In fact there is not\na more marked peculiarity in his genius than the union with its\nstrength of a most uncommon gentleness, and in the personal ways of\nthe man this was equally manifest.\"--Vol. i. p. 496.\n\n\nOf his works, thus:\n\n\n\"Though his mind was cast in the antique mould, it had opened itself\nto every kind of impression through a long and varied life; he has\nwritten with equal excellence in both poetry and prose, which can\nhardly be said of any of his contemporaries; and perhaps the single\nepithet by which his books would be best described is that reserved\nexclusively for books not characterised only by genius, but also by\nspecial individuality.  They are unique.  Having possessed them, we\nshould miss them.  Their place would be supplied by no others.  They\nhave that about them, moreover, which renders it almost certain that\nthey will frequently be resorted to in future time.  There are none\nin the language more quotable.  Even where impulsiveness and want of\npatience have left them most fragmentary, this rich compensation is\noffered to the reader.  There is hardly a conceivable subject, in\nlife or literature, which they do not illustrate by striking\naphorisms, by concise and profound observations, by wisdom ever\napplicable to the deeds of men, and by wit as available for their\nenjoyment.  Nor, above all, will there anywhere be found a more\npervading passion for liberty, a fiercer hatred of the base, a wider\nsympathy with the wronged and the oppressed, or help more ready at\nall times for those who fight at odds and disadvantage against the\npowerful and the fortunate, than in the writings of Walter Savage\nLandor.\"--Last page of second volume.\n\n\nThe impression was strong upon the present writer\'s mind, as on Mr.\nForster\'s, during years of close friendship with the subject of this\nbiography, that his animosities were chiefly referable to the\nsingular inability in him to dissociate other people\'s ways of\nthinking from his own.  He had, to the last, a ludicrous grievance\n(both Mr. Forster and the writer have often amused themselves with\nit) against a good-natured nobleman, doubtless perfectly unconscious\nof having ever given him offence.  The offence was, that on the\noccasion of some dinner party in another nobleman\'s house, many\nyears before, this innocent lord (then a commoner) had passed in to\ndinner, through some door, before him, as he himself was about to\npass in through that same door with a lady on his arm.  Now, Landor\nwas a gentleman of most scrupulous politeness, and in his carriage\nof himself towards ladies there was a certain mixture of stateliness\nand deference, belonging to quite another time, and, as Mr. Pepys\nwould observe, \"mighty pretty to see\".  If he could by any effort\nimagine himself committing such a high crime and misdemeanour as\nthat in question, he could only imagine himself as doing it of a set\npurpose, under the sting of some vast injury, to inflict a great\naffront.  A deliberately designed affront on the part of another\nman, it therefore remained to the end of his days.  The manner in\nwhich, as time went on, he permeated the unfortunate lord\'s ancestry\nwith this offence, was whimsically characteristic of Landor.  The\nwriter remembers very well when only the individual himself was held\nresponsible in the story for the breach of good breeding; but in\nanother ten years or so, it began to appear that his father had\nalways been remarkable for ill manners; and in yet another ten years\nor so, his grandfather developed into quite a prodigy of coarse\nbehaviour.\n\nMr. Boythorn--if he may again be quoted--said of his adversary, Sir\nLeicester Dedlock:  \"That fellow is, AND HIS FATHER WAS, AND HIS\nGRANDFATHER WAS, the most stiff-necked, arrogant, imbecile, pig-\nheaded numskull, ever, by some inexplicable mistake of Nature, born\nin any station of life but a walking-stick\'s!\"\n\nThe strength of some of Mr. Landor\'s most captivating kind qualities\nwas traceable to the same source.  Knowing how keenly he himself\nwould feel the being at any small social disadvantage, or the being\nunconsciously placed in any ridiculous light, he was wonderfully\nconsiderate of shy people, or of such as might be below the level of\nhis usual conversation, or otherwise out of their element.  The\nwriter once observed him in the keenest distress of mind in behalf\nof a modest young stranger who came into a drawing-room with a glove\non his head.  An expressive commentary on this sympathetic\ncondition, and on the delicacy with which he advanced to the young\nstranger\'s rescue, was afterwards furnished by himself at a friendly\ndinner at Gore House, when it was the most delightful of houses.\nHis dress--say, his cravat or shirt-collar--had become slightly\ndisarranged on a hot evening, and Count D\'Orsay laughingly called\nhis attention to the circumstance as we rose from table.  Landor\nbecame flushed, and greatly agitated:  \"My dear Count D\'Orsay, I\nthank you!  My dear Count D\'Orsay, I thank you from my soul for\npointing out to me the abominable condition to which I am reduced!\nIf I had entered the Drawing-room, and presented myself before Lady\nBlessington in so absurd a light, I would have instantly gone home,\nput a pistol to my head, and blown my brains out!\"\n\nMr. Forster tells a similar story of his keeping a company waiting\ndinner, through losing his way; and of his seeing no remedy for that\nbreach of politeness but cutting his throat, or drowning himself,\nunless a countryman whom he met could direct him by a short road to\nthe house where the party were assembled.  Surely these are\nexpressive notes on the gravity and reality of his explosive\ninclinations to kill kings!\n\nHis manner towards boys was charming, and the earnestness of his\nwish to be on equal terms with them and to win their confidence was\nquite touching.  Few, reading Mr. Forster\'s book, can fall to see in\nthis, his pensive remembrance of that \"studious wilful boy at once\nshy and impetuous\", who had not many intimacies at Rugby, but who\nwas \"generally popular and respected, and used his influence often\nto save the younger boys from undue harshness or violence\".  The\nimpulsive yearnings of his passionate heart towards his own boy, on\ntheir meeting at Bath, after years of separation, likewise burn\nthrough this phase of his character.\n\nBut a more spiritual, softened, and unselfish aspect of it, was to\nderived from his respectful belief in happiness which he himself had\nmissed.  His marriage had not been a felicitous one--it may be\nfairly assumed for either side--but no trace of bitterness or\ndistrust concerning other marriages was in his mind.  He was never\nmore serene than in the midst of a domestic circle, and was\ninvariably remarkable for a perfectly benignant interest in young\ncouples and young lovers.  That, in his ever-fresh fancy, he\nconceived in this association innumerable histories of himself\ninvolving far more unlikely events that never happened than Isaac\nD\'Israeli ever imagined, is hardly to be doubted; but as to this\npart of his real history he was mute, or revealed his nobleness in\nan impulse to be generously just.  We verge on delicate ground, but\na slight remembrance rises in the writer which can grate nowhere.\nMr. Forster relates how a certain friend, being in Florence, sent\nhim home a leaf from the garden of his old house at Fiesole.  That\nfriend had first asked him what he should send him home, and he had\nstipulated for this gift--found by Mr. Forster among his papers\nafter his death.  The friend, on coming back to England, related to\nLandor that he had been much embarrassed, on going in search of the\nleaf, by his driver\'s suddenly stopping his horses in a narrow lane,\nand presenting him (the friend) to \"La Signora Landora\".  The lady\nwas walking alone on a bright Italian-winter-day; and the man,\nhaving been told to drive to the Villa Landora, inferred that he\nmust be conveying a guest or visitor.  \"I pulled off my hat,\" said\nthe friend, \"apologised for the coachman\'s mistake, and drove on.\nThe lady was walking with a rapid and firm step, had bright eyes, a\nfine fresh colour, and looked animated and agreeable.\"  Landor\nchecked off each clause of the description, with a stately nod of\nmore than ready assent, and replied, with all his tremendous energy\nconcentrated into the sentence:  \"And the Lord forbid that I should\ndo otherwise than declare that she always WAS agreeable--to every\none but ME!\"\n\nMr. Forster step by step builds up the evidence on which he writes\nthis life and states this character.  In like manner, he gives the\nevidence for his high estimation of Landor\'s works, and--it may be\nadded--for their recompense against some neglect, in finding so\nsympathetic, acute, and devoted a champion.  Nothing in the book is\nmore remarkable than his examination of each of Landor\'s successive\npieces of writing, his delicate discernment of their beauties, and\nhis strong desire to impart his own perceptions in this wise to the\ngreat audience that is yet to come.  It rarely befalls an author to\nhave such a commentator:  to become the subject of so much artistic\nskill and knowledge, combined with such infinite and loving pains.\nAlike as a piece of Biography, and as a commentary upon the beauties\nof a great writer, the book is a massive book; as the man and the\nwriter were massive too.  Sometimes, when the balance held by Mr.\nForster has seemed for a moment to turn a little heavily against the\ninfirmities of temperament of a grand old friend, we have felt\nsomething of a shock; but we have not once been able to gainsay the\njustice of the scales.  This feeling, too, has only fluttered out of\nthe detail, here or there, and has vanished before the whole.  We\nfully agree with Mr. Forster that \"judgment has been passed\"--as it\nshould be--\"with an equal desire to be only just on all the\nqualities of his temperament which affected necessarily not his own\nlife only.  But, now that the story is told, no one will have\ndifficulty in striking the balance between its good and ill; and\nwhat was really imperishable in Landor\'s genius will not be\ntreasured less, or less understood, for the more perfect knowledge\nof his character\".\n\nMr. Forster\'s second volume gives a facsimile of Landor\'s writing at\nseventy-five.  It may be interesting to those who are curious in\ncalligraphy, to know that its resemblance to the recent handwriting\nof that great genius, M. Victor Hugo, is singularly strong.\n\nIn a military burial-ground in India, the name of Walter Landor is\nassociated with the present writer\'s over the grave of a young\nofficer.  No name could stand there, more inseparably associated in\nthe writer\'s mind with the dignity of generosity:  with a noble\nscorn of all littleness, all cruelty, oppression, fraud, and false\npretence.\n\n\n\nADDRESS WHICH APPEARED SHORTLY PREVIOUS TO THE COMPLETION OF THE\nTWENTIETH VOLUME (1868), INTIMATING A NEW SERIES OF \"ALL THE YEAR\nROUND\"\n\n\n\nI beg to announce to the readers of this Journal, that on the\ncompletion of the Twentieth Volume on the Twenty-eighth of November,\nin the present year, I shall commence an entirely New Series of All\nthe Year Round.  The change is not only due to the convenience of\nthe public (with which a set of such books, extending beyond twenty\nlarge volumes, would be quite incompatible), but is also resolved\nupon for the purpose of effecting some desirable improvements in\nrespect of type, paper, and size of page, which could not otherwise\nbe made.  To the Literature of the New Series it would not become me\nto refer, beyond glancing at the pages of this Journal, and of its\npredecessor, through a score of years; inasmuch as my regular\nfellow-labourers and I will be at our old posts, in company with\nthose younger comrades, whom I have had the pleasure of enrolling\nfrom time to time, and whose number it is always one of my\npleasantest editorial duties to enlarge.\n\nAs it is better that every kind of work honestly undertaken and\ndischarged, should speak for itself than be spoken for, I will only\nremark further on one intended omission in the New Series.  The\nExtra Christmas Number has now been so extensively, and regularly,\nand often imitated, that it is in very great danger of becoming\ntiresome.  I have therefore resolved (though I cannot add,\nwillingly) to abolish it, at the highest tide of its success.\n\nCHARLES DICKENS.\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n{1}  Walter Savage Landor:  a Biography, by John Forster, 2 vols.\nChapman and Hall.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg Etext of Contributions to:  All The Year Round \n\nThe Project Gutenberg Etext of American Notes, by Charles Dickens\n#9 in our series by Charles Dickens\n\n\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check\nthe copyright laws for your country before posting these files!!\n\nPlease take a look at the important information in this header.\nWe encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an\nelectronic path open for the next readers.

They can examine \nfor themselves whether there has been anything in the public career \nof that country since, at home or abroad, which suggests that those \ninfluences and tendencies really did exist.  As they find the fact, \nthey will judge me.  If they discern any evidences of wrong-going, \nin any direction that I have indicated, they will acknowledge that \nI had reason in what I wrote.  If they discern no such indications, \nthey will consider me altogether mistaken - but not wilfully.\n\nPrejudiced, I am not, and never have been, otherwise than in favour \nof the United States.  I have many friends in America, I feel a \ngrateful interest in the country, I hope and believe it will \nsuccessfully work out a problem of the highest importance to the \nwhole human race.  To represent me as viewing AMERICA with ill-\nnature, coldness, or animosity, is merely to do a very foolish \nthing:  which is always a very easy one.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I - GOING AWAY\n\n\n\nI SHALL never forget the one-fourth serious and three-fourths \ncomical astonishment, with which, on the morning of the third of \nJanuary eighteen-hundred-and-forty-two, I opened the door of, and \nput my head into, a \'state-room\' on board the Britannia steam-\npacket, twelve hundred tons burthen per register, bound for Halifax \nand Boston, and carrying Her Majesty\'s mails.\n\nThat this state-room had been specially engaged for \'Charles \nDickens, Esquire, and Lady,\' was rendered sufficiently clear even \nto my scared intellect by a very small manuscript, announcing the \nfact, which was pinned on a very flat quilt, covering a very thin \nmattress, spread like a surgical plaster on a most inaccessible \nshelf.  But that this was the state-room concerning which Charles \nDickens, Esquire, and Lady, had held daily and nightly conferences \nfor at least four months preceding:  that this could by any \npossibility be that small snug chamber of the imagination, which \nCharles Dickens, Esquire, with the spirit of prophecy strong upon \nhim, had always foretold would contain at least one little sofa, \nand which his lady, with a modest yet most magnificent sense of its \nlimited dimensions, had from the first opined would not hold more \nthan two enormous portmanteaus in some odd corner out of sight \n(portmanteaus which could now no more be got in at the door, not to \nsay stowed away, than a giraffe could be persuaded or forced into a \nflower-pot):  that this utterly impracticable, thoroughly hopeless, \nand profoundly preposterous box, had the remotest reference to, or \nconnection with, those chaste and pretty, not to say gorgeous \nlittle bowers, sketched by a masterly hand, in the highly varnished \nlithographic plan hanging up in the agent\'s counting-house in the \ncity of London:  that this room of state, in short, could be \nanything but a pleasant fiction and cheerful jest of the captain\'s, \ninvented and put in practice for the better relish and enjoyment of \nthe real state-room presently to be disclosed:- these were truths \nwhich I really could not, for the moment, bring my mind at all to \nbear upon or comprehend.  And I sat down upon a kind of horsehair \nslab, or perch, of which there were two within; and looked, without \nany expression of countenance whatever, at some friends who had \ncome on board with us, and who were crushing their faces into all \nmanner of shapes by endeavouring to squeeze them through the small \ndoorway.\n\nWe had experienced a pretty smart shock before coming below, which, \nbut that we were the most sanguine people living, might have \nprepared us for the worst.  The imaginative artist to whom I have \nalready made allusion, has depicted in the same great work, a \nchamber of almost interminable perspective, furnished, as Mr. \nRobins would say, in a style of more than Eastern splendour, and \nfilled (but not inconveniently so) with groups of ladies and \ngentlemen, in the very highest state of enjoyment and vivacity.  \nBefore descending into the bowels of the ship, we had passed from \nthe deck into a long narrow apartment, not unlike a gigantic hearse \nwith windows in the sides; having at the upper end a melancholy \nstove, at which three or four chilly stewards were warming their \nhands; while on either side, extending down its whole dreary \nlength, was a long, long table, over each of which a rack, fixed to \nthe low roof, and stuck full of drinking-glasses and cruet-stands, \nhinted dismally at rolling seas and heavy weather.  I had not at \nthat time seen the ideal presentment of this chamber which has \nsince gratified me so much, but I observed that one of our friends \nwho had made the arrangements for our voyage, turned pale on \nentering, retreated on the friend behind him., smote his forehead \ninvoluntarily, and said below his breath, \'Impossible! it cannot \nbe!\' or words to that effect.  He recovered himself however by a \ngreat effort, and after a preparatory cough or two, cried, with a \nghastly smile which is still before me, looking at the same time \nround the walls, \'Ha! the breakfast-room, steward - eh?\'  We all \nforesaw what the answer must be:  we knew the agony he suffered.  \nHe had often spoken of THE SALOON; had taken in and lived upon the \npictorial idea; had usually given us to understand, at home, that \nto form a just conception of it, it would be necessary to multiply \nthe size and furniture of an ordinary drawing-room by seven, and \nthen fall short of the reality.  When the man in reply avowed the \ntruth; the blunt, remorseless, naked truth; \'This is the saloon, \nsir\' - he actually reeled beneath the blow.\n\nIn persons who were so soon to part, and interpose between their \nelse daily communication the formidable barrier of many thousand \nmiles of stormy space, and who were for that reason anxious to cast \nno other cloud, not even the passing shadow of a moment\'s \ndisappointment or discomfiture, upon the short interval of happy \ncompanionship that yet remained to them - in persons so situated, \nthe natural transition from these first surprises was obviously \ninto peals of hearty laughter, and I can report that I, for one, \nbeing still seated upon the slab or perch before mentioned, roared \noutright until the vessel rang again.  Thus, in less than two \nminutes after coming upon it for the first time, we all by common \nconsent agreed that this state-room was the pleasantest and most \nfacetious and capital contrivance possible; and that to have had it \none inch larger, would have been quite a disagreeable and \ndeplorable state of things.  And with this; and with showing how, - \nby very nearly closing the door, and twining in and out like \nserpents, and by counting the little washing slab as standing-room, \n- we could manage to insinuate four people into it, all at one \ntime; and entreating each other to observe how very airy it was (in \ndock), and how there was a beautiful port-hole which could be kept \nopen all day (weather permitting), and how there was quite a large \nbull\'s-eye just over the looking-glass which would render shaving a \nperfectly easy and delightful process (when the ship didn\'t roll \ntoo much); we arrived, at last, at the unanimous conclusion that it \nwas rather spacious than otherwise:  though I do verily believe \nthat, deducting the two berths, one above the other, than which \nnothing smaller for sleeping in was ever made except coffins, it \nwas no bigger than one of those hackney cabriolets which have the \ndoor behind, and shoot their fares out, like sacks of coals, upon \nthe pavement.\n\nHaving settled this point to the perfect satisfaction of all \nparties, concerned and unconcerned, we sat down round the fire in \nthe ladies\' cabin - just to try the effect.  It was rather dark, \ncertainly; but somebody said, \'of course it would be light, at \nsea,\' a proposition to which we all assented; echoing \'of course, \nof course;\' though it would be exceedingly difficult to say why we \nthought so.  I remember, too, when we had discovered and exhausted \nanother topic of consolation in the circumstance of this ladies\' \ncabin adjoining our state-room, and the consequently immense \nfeasibility of sitting there at all times and seasons, and had \nfallen into a momentary silence, leaning our faces on our hands and \nlooking at the fire, one of our party said, with the solemn air of \na man who had made a discovery, \'What a relish mulled claret will \nhave down here!\' which appeared to strike us all most forcibly; as \nthough there were something spicy and high-flavoured in cabins, \nwhich essentially improved that composition, and rendered it quite \nincapable of perfection anywhere else.\n\nThere was a stewardess, too, actively engaged in producing clean \nsheets and table-cloths from the very entrails of the sofas, and \nfrom unexpected lockers, of such artful mechanism, that it made \none\'s head ache to see them opened one after another, and rendered \nit quite a distracting circumstance to follow her proceedings, and \nto find that every nook and corner and individual piece of \nfurniture was something else besides what it pretended to be, and \nwas a mere trap and deception and place of secret stowage, whose \nostensible purpose was its least useful one.\n\nGod bless that stewardess for her piously fraudulent account of \nJanuary voyages!  God bless her for her clear recollection of the \ncompanion passage of last year, when nobody was ill, and everybody \ndancing from morning to night, and it was \'a run\' of twelve days, \nand a piece of the purest frolic, and delight, and jollity!  All \nhappiness be with her for her bright face and her pleasant Scotch \ntongue, which had sounds of old Home in it for my fellow-traveller; \nand for her predictions of fair winds and fine weather (all wrong, \nor I shouldn\'t be half so fond of her); and for the ten thousand \nsmall fragments of genuine womanly tact, by which, without piecing \nthem elaborately together, and patching them up into shape and form \nand case and pointed application, she nevertheless did plainly show \nthat all young mothers on one side of the Atlantic were near and \nclose at hand to their little children left upon the other; and \nthat what seemed to the uninitiated a serious journey, was, to \nthose who were in the secret, a mere frolic, to be sung about and \nwhistled at!  Light be her heart, and gay her merry eyes, for \nyears!\n\nThe state-room had grown pretty fast; but by this time it had \nexpanded into something quite bulky, and almost boasted a bay-\nwindow to view the sea from.  So we went upon deck again in high \nspirits; and there, everything was in such a state of bustle and \nactive preparation, that the blood quickened its pace, and whirled \nthrough one\'s veins on that clear frosty morning with involuntary \nmirthfulness.  For every gallant ship was riding slowly up and \ndown, and every little boat was splashing noisily in the water; and \nknots of people stood upon the wharf, gazing with a kind of \'dread \ndelight\' on the far-famed fast American steamer; and one party of \nmen were \'taking in the milk,\' or, in other words, getting the cow \non board; and another were filling the icehouses to the very throat \nwith fresh provisions; with butchers\'-meat and garden-stuff, pale \nsucking-pigs, calves\' heads in scores, beef, veal, and pork, and \npoultry out of all proportion; and others were coiling ropes and \nbusy with oakum yarns; and others were lowering heavy packages into \nthe hold; and the purser\'s head was barely visible as it loomed in \na state, of exquisite perplexity from the midst of a vast pile of \npassengers\' luggage; and there seemed to be nothing going on \nanywhere, or uppermost in the mind of anybody, but preparations for \nthis mighty voyage.  This, with the bright cold sun, the bracing \nair, the crisply-curling water, the thin white crust of morning ice \nupon the decks which crackled with a sharp and cheerful sound \nbeneath the lightest tread, was irresistible.  And when, again upon \nthe shore, we turned and saw from the vessel\'s mast her name \nsignalled in flags of joyous colours, and fluttering by their side \nthe beautiful American banner with its stars and stripes, - the \nlong three thousand miles and more, and, longer still, the six \nwhole months of absence, so dwindled and faded, that the ship had \ngone out and come home again, and it was broad spring already in \nthe Coburg Dock at Liverpool.\n\nI have not inquired among my medical acquaintance, whether Turtle, \nand cold Punch, with Hock, Champagne, and Claret, and all the \nslight et cetera usually included in an unlimited order for a good \ndinner - especially when it is left to the liberal construction of \nmy faultless friend, Mr. Radley, of the Adelphi Hotel - are \npeculiarly calculated to suffer a sea-change; or whether a plain \nmutton-chop, and a glass or two of sherry, would be less likely of \nconversion into foreign and disconcerting material.  My own opinion \nis, that whether one is discreet or indiscreet in these \nparticulars, on the eve of a sea-voyage, is a matter of little \nconsequence; and that, to use a common phrase, \'it comes to very \nmuch the same thing in the end.\'  Be this as it may, I know that \nthe dinner of that day was undeniably perfect; that it comprehended \nall these items, and a great many more; and that we all did ample \njustice to it.  And I know too, that, bating a certain tacit \navoidance of any allusion to to-morrow; such as may be supposed to \nprevail between delicate-minded turnkeys, and a sensitive prisoner \nwho is to be hanged next morning; we got on very well, and, all \nthings considered, were merry enough.\n\nWhen the morning - THE morning - came, and we met at breakfast, it \nwas curious to see how eager we all were to prevent a moment\'s \npause in the conversation, and how astoundingly gay everybody was:  \nthe forced spirits of each member of the little party having as \nmuch likeness to his natural mirth, as hot-house peas at five \nguineas the quart, resemble in flavour the growth of the dews, and \nair, and rain of Heaven.  But as one o\'clock, the hour for going \naboard, drew near, this volubility dwindled away by little and \nlittle, despite the most persevering efforts to the contrary, until \nat last, the matter being now quite desperate, we threw off all \ndisguise; openly speculated upon where we should be this time to-\nmorrow, this time next day, and so forth; and entrusted a vast \nnumber of messages to those who intended returning to town that \nnight, which were to be delivered at home and elsewhere without \nfail, within the very shortest possible space of time after the \narrival of the railway train at Euston Square.  And commissions and \nremembrances do so crowd upon one at such a time, that we were \nstill busied with this employment when we found ourselves fused, as \nit were, into a dense conglomeration of passengers and passengers\' \nfriends and passengers\' luggage, all jumbled together on the deck \nof a small steamboat, and panting and snorting off to the packet, \nwhich had worked out of dock yesterday afternoon and was now lying \nat her moorings in the river.\n\nAnd there she is! all eyes are turned to where she lies, dimly \ndiscernible through the gathering fog of the early winter \nafternoon; every finger is pointed in the same direction; and \nmurmurs of interest and admiration - as \'How beautiful she looks!\' \n\'How trim she is!\' - are heard on every side.  Even the lazy \ngentleman with his hat on one side and his hands in his pockets, \nwho has dispensed so much consolation by inquiring with a yawn of \nanother gentleman whether he is \'going across\' - as if it were a \nferry - even he condescends to look that way, and nod his head, as \nwho should say, \'No mistake about THAT:\' and not even the sage Lord \nBurleigh in his nod, included half so much as this lazy gentleman \nof might who has made the passage (as everybody on board has found \nout already; it\'s impossible to say how) thirteen times without a \nsingle accident!  There is another passenger very much wrapped-up, \nwho has been frowned down by the rest, and morally trampled upon \nand crushed, for presuming to inquire with a timid interest how \nlong it is since the poor President went down.  He is standing \nclose to the lazy gentleman, and says with a faint smile that he \nbelieves She is a very strong Ship; to which the lazy gentleman, \nlooking first in his questioner\'s eye and then very hard in the \nwind\'s, answers unexpectedly and ominously, that She need be.  Upon \nthis the lazy gentleman instantly falls very low in the popular \nestimation, and the passengers, with looks of defiance, whisper to \neach other that he is an ass, and an impostor, and clearly don\'t \nknow anything at all about it.\n\nBut we are made fast alongside the packet, whose huge red funnel is \nsmoking bravely, giving rich promise of serious intentions.  \nPacking-cases, portmanteaus, carpet-bags, and boxes, are already \npassed from hand to hand, and hauled on board with breathless \nrapidity.  The officers, smartly dressed, are at the gangway \nhanding the passengers up the side, and hurrying the men.  In five \nminutes\' time, the little steamer is utterly deserted, and the \npacket is beset and over-run by its late freight, who instantly \npervade the whole ship, and are to be met with by the dozen in \nevery nook and corner:  swarming down below with their own baggage, \nand stumbling over other people\'s; disposing themselves comfortably \nin wrong cabins, and creating a most horrible confusion by having \nto turn out again; madly bent upon opening locked doors, and on \nforcing a passage into all kinds of out-of-the-way places where \nthere is no thoroughfare; sending wild stewards, with elfin hair, \nto and fro upon the breezy decks on unintelligible errands, \nimpossible of execution:  and in short, creating the most \nextraordinary and bewildering tumult.  In the midst of all this, \nthe lazy gentleman, who seems to have no luggage of any kind - not \nso much as a friend, even - lounges up and down the hurricane deck, \ncoolly puffing a cigar; and, as this unconcerned demeanour again \nexalts him in the opinion of those who have leisure to observe his \nproceedings, every time he looks up at the masts, or down at the \ndecks, or over the side, they look there too, as wondering whether \nhe sees anything wrong anywhere, and hoping that, in case he \nshould, he will have the goodness to mention it.\n\nWhat have we here?  The captain\'s boat! and yonder the captain \nhimself.  Now, by all our hopes and wishes, the very man he ought \nto be!  A well-made, tight-built, dapper little fellow; with a \nruddy face, which is a letter of invitation to shake him by both \nhands at once; and with a clear, blue honest eye, that it does one \ngood to see one\'s sparkling image in.  \'Ring the bell!\'  \'Ding, \nding, ding!\' the very bell is in a hurry.  \'Now for the shore - \nwho\'s for the shore?\' - \'These gentlemen, I am sorry to say.\'  They \nare away, and never said, Good b\'ye.  Ah now they wave it from the \nlittle boat.  \'Good b\'ye! Good b\'ye!\'  Three cheers from them; \nthree more from us; three more from them:  and they are gone.\n\nTo and fro, to and fro, to and fro again a hundred times!  This \nwaiting for the latest mail-bags is worse than all.  If we could \nhave gone off in the midst of that last burst, we should have \nstarted triumphantly:  but to lie here, two hours and more in the \ndamp fog, neither staying at home nor going abroad, is letting one \ngradually down into the very depths of dulness and low spirits.  A \nspeck in the mist, at last!  That\'s something.  It is the boat we \nwait for!  That\'s more to the purpose.  The captain appears on the \npaddle-box with his speaking trumpet; the officers take their \nstations; all hands are on the alert; the flagging hopes of the \npassengers revive; the cooks pause in their savoury work, and look \nout with faces full of interest.  The boat comes alongside; the \nbags are dragged in anyhow, and flung down for the moment anywhere.  \nThree cheers more:  and as the first one rings upon our ears, the \nvessel throbs like a strong giant that has just received the breath \nof life; the two great wheels turn fiercely round for the first \ntime; and the noble ship, with wind and tide astern, breaks proudly \nthrough the lashed and roaming water.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II - THE PASSAGE OUT\n\n\n\nWE all dined together that day; and a rather formidable party we \nwere:  no fewer than eighty-six strong.  The vessel being pretty \ndeep in the water, with all her coals on board and so many \npassengers, and the weather being calm and quiet, there was but \nlittle motion; so that before the dinner was half over, even those \npassengers who were most distrustful of themselves plucked up \namazingly; and those who in the morning had returned to the \nuniversal question, \'Are you a good sailor?\' a very decided \nnegative, now either parried the inquiry with the evasive reply, \n\'Oh! I suppose I\'m no worse than anybody else;\' or, reckless of all \nmoral obligations, answered boldly \'Yes:\' and with some irritation \ntoo, as though they would add, \'I should like to know what you see \nin ME, sir, particularly, to justify suspicion!\'\n\nNotwithstanding this high tone of courage and confidence, I could \nnot but observe that very few remained long over their wine; and \nthat everybody had an unusual love of the open air; and that the \nfavourite and most coveted seats were invariably those nearest to \nthe door.  The tea-table, too, was by no means as well attended as \nthe dinner-table; and there was less whist-playing than might have \nbeen expected.  Still, with the exception of one lady, who had \nretired with some precipitation at dinner-time, immediately after \nbeing assisted to the finest cut of a very yellow boiled leg of \nmutton with very green capers, there were no invalids as yet; and \nwalking, and smoking, and drinking of brandy-and-water (but always \nin the open air), went on with unabated spirit, until eleven \no\'clock or thereabouts, when \'turning in\' - no sailor of seven \nhours\' experience talks of going to bed - became the order of the \nnight.  The perpetual tramp of boot-heels on the decks gave place \nto a heavy silence, and the whole human freight was stowed away \nbelow, excepting a very few stragglers, like myself, who were \nprobably, like me, afraid to go there.\n\nTo one unaccustomed to such scenes, this is a very striking time on \nshipboard.  Afterwards, and when its novelty had long worn off, it \nnever ceased to have a peculiar interest and charm for me.  The \ngloom through which the great black mass holds its direct and \ncertain course; the rushing water, plainly heard, but dimly seen; \nthe broad, white, glistening track, that follows in the vessel\'s \nwake; the men on the look-out forward, who would be scarcely \nvisible against the dark sky, but for their blotting out some score \nof glistening stars; the helmsman at the wheel, with the \nilluminated card before him, shining, a speck of light amidst the \ndarkness, like something sentient and of Divine intelligence; the \nmelancholy sighing of the wind through block, and rope, and chain; \nthe gleaming forth of light from every crevice, nook, and tiny \npiece of glass about the decks, as though the ship were filled with \nfire in hiding, ready to burst through any outlet, wild with its \nresistless power of death and ruin.  At first, too, and even when \nthe hour, and all the objects it exalts, have come to be familiar, \nit is difficult, alone and thoughtful, to hold them to their proper \nshapes and forms.  They change with the wandering fancy; assume the \nsemblance of things left far away; put on the well-remembered \naspect of favourite places dearly loved; and even people them with \nshadows.  Streets, houses, rooms; figures so like their usual \noccupants, that they have startled me by their reality, which far \nexceeded, as it seemed to me, all power of mine to conjure up the \nabsent; have, many and many a time, at such an hour, grown suddenly \nout of objects with whose real look, and use, and purpose, I was as \nwell acquainted as with my own two hands.\n\nMy own two hands, and feet likewise, being very cold, however, on \nthis particular occasion, I crept below at midnight.  It was not \nexactly comfortable below.  It was decidedly close; and it was \nimpossible to be unconscious of the presence of that extraordinary \ncompound of strange smells, which is to be found nowhere but on \nboard ship, and which is such a subtle perfume that it seems to \nenter at every pore of the skin, and whisper of the hold.  Two \npassengers\' wives (one of them my own) lay already in silent \nagonies on the sofa; and one lady\'s maid (MY lady\'s) was a mere \nbundle on the floor, execrating her destiny, and pounding her curl-\npapers among the stray boxes.  Everything sloped the wrong way:  \nwhich in itself was an aggravation scarcely to be borne.  I had \nleft the door open, a moment before, in the bosom of a gentle \ndeclivity, and, when I turned to shut it, it was on the summit of a \nlofty eminence.  Now every plank and timber creaked, as if the ship \nwere made of wicker-work; and now crackled, like an enormous fire \nof the driest possible twigs.  There was nothing for it but bed; so \nI went to bed.\n\nIt was pretty much the same for the next two days, with a tolerably \nfair wind and dry weather.  I read in bed (but to this hour I don\'t \nknow what) a good deal; and reeled on deck a little; drank cold \nbrandy-and-water with an unspeakable disgust, and ate hard biscuit \nperseveringly:  not ill, but going to be.\n\nIt is the third morning.  I am awakened out of my sleep by a dismal \nshriek from my wife, who demands to know whether there\'s any \ndanger.  I rouse myself, and look out of bed.  The water-jug is \nplunging and leaping like a lively dolphin; all the smaller \narticles are afloat, except my shoes, which are stranded on a \ncarpet-bag, high and dry, like a couple of coal-barges.  Suddenly I \nsee them spring into the air, and behold the looking-glass, which \nis nailed to the wall, sticking fast upon the ceiling.  At the same \ntime the door entirely disappears, and a new one is opened in the \nfloor.  Then I begin to comprehend that the state-room is standing \non its head.\n\nBefore it is possible to make any arrangement at all compatible \nwith this novel state of things, the ship rights.  Before one can \nsay \'Thank Heaven!\' she wrongs again.  Before one can cry she IS \nwrong, she seems to have started forward, and to be a creature \nactually running of its own accord, with broken knees and failing \nlegs, through every variety of hole and pitfall, and stumbling \nconstantly.  Before one can so much as wonder, she takes a high \nleap into the air.  Before she has well done that, she takes a deep \ndive into the water.  Before she has gained the surface, she throws \na summerset.  The instant she is on her legs, she rushes backward.  \nAnd so she goes on staggering, heaving, wrestling, leaping, diving, \njumping, pitching, throbbing, rolling, and rocking:  and going \nthrough all these movements, sometimes by turns, and sometimes \naltogether:  until one feels disposed to roar for mercy.\n\nA steward passes.  \'Steward!\'  \'Sir?\'  \'What IS the matter? what DO \nyou call this?\'  \'Rather a heavy sea on, sir, and a head-wind.\'\n\nA head-wind!  Imagine a human face upon the vessel\'s prow, with \nfifteen thousand Samsons in one bent upon driving her back, and \nhitting her exactly between the eyes whenever she attempts to \nadvance an inch.  Imagine the ship herself, with every pulse and \nartery of her huge body swollen and bursting under this \nmaltreatment, sworn to go on or die.  Imagine the wind howling, the \nsea roaring, the rain beating:  all in furious array against her.  \nPicture the sky both dark and wild, and the clouds, in fearful \nsympathy with the waves, making another ocean in the air.  Add to \nall this, the clattering on deck and down below; the tread of \nhurried feet; the loud hoarse shouts of seamen; the gurgling in and \nout of water through the scuppers; with, every now and then, the \nstriking of a heavy sea upon the planks above, with the deep, dead, \nheavy sound of thunder heard within a vault; - and there is the \nhead-wind of that January morning.\n\nI say nothing of what may be called the domestic noises of the \nship:  such as the breaking of glass and crockery, the tumbling \ndown of stewards, the gambols, overhead, of loose casks and truant \ndozens of bottled porter, and the very remarkable and far from \nexhilarating sounds raised in their various state-rooms by the \nseventy passengers who were too ill to get up to breakfast.  I say \nnothing of them:  for although I lay listening to this concert for \nthree or four days, I don\'t think I heard it for more than a \nquarter of a minute, at the expiration of which term, I lay down \nagain, excessively sea-sick.\n\nNot sea-sick, be it understood, in the ordinary acceptation of the \nterm:  I wish I had been:  but in a form which I have never seen or \nheard described, though I have no doubt it is very common.  I lay \nthere, all the day long, quite coolly and contentedly; with no \nsense of weariness, with no desire to get up, or get better, or \ntake the air; with no curiosity, or care, or regret, of any sort or \ndegree, saving that I think I can remember, in this universal \nindifference, having a kind of lazy joy - of fiendish delight, if \nanything so lethargic can be dignified with the title - in the fact \nof my wife being too ill to talk to me.  If I may be allowed to \nillustrate my state of mind by such an example, I should say that I \nwas exactly in the condition of the elder Mr. Willet, after the \nincursion of the rioters into his bar at Chigwell.  Nothing would \nhave surprised me.  If, in the momentary illumination of any ray of \nintelligence that may have come upon me in the way of thoughts of \nHome, a goblin postman, with a scarlet coat and bell, had come into \nthat little kennel before me, broad awake in broad day, and, \napologising for being damp through walking in the sea, had handed \nme a letter directed to myself, in familiar characters, I am \ncertain I should not have felt one atom of astonishment:  I should \nhave been perfectly satisfied.  If Neptune himself had walked in, \nwith a toasted shark on his trident, I should have looked upon the \nevent as one of the very commonest everyday occurrences.\n\nOnce - once - I found myself on deck.  I don\'t know how I got \nthere, or what possessed me to go there, but there I was; and \ncompletely dressed too, with a huge pea-coat on, and a pair of \nboots such as no weak man in his senses could ever have got into.  \nI found myself standing, when a gleam of consciousness came upon \nme, holding on to something.  I don\'t know what.  I think it was \nthe boatswain:  or it may have been the pump:  or possibly the cow.  \nI can\'t say how long I had been there; whether a day or a minute.  \nI recollect trying to think about something (about anything in the \nwhole wide world, I was not particular) without the smallest \neffect.  I could not even make out which was the sea, and which the \nsky, for the horizon seemed drunk, and was flying wildly about in \nall directions.  Even in that incapable state, however, I \nrecognised the lazy gentleman standing before me:  nautically clad \nin a suit of shaggy blue, with an oilskin hat.  But I was too \nimbecile, although I knew it to be he, to separate him from his \ndress; and tried to call him, I remember, PILOT.  After another \ninterval of total unconsciousness, I found he had gone, and \nrecognised another figure in its place.  It seemed to wave and \nfluctuate before me as though I saw it reflected in an unsteady \nlooking-glass; but I knew it for the captain; and such was the \ncheerful influence of his face, that I tried to smile:  yes, even \nthen I tried to smile.  I saw by his gestures that he addressed me; \nbut it was a long time before I could make out that he remonstrated \nagainst my standing up to my knees in water - as I was; of course I \ndon\'t know why.  I tried to thank him, but couldn\'t.  I could only \npoint to my boots - or wherever I supposed my boots to be - and say \nin a plaintive voice, \'Cork soles:\' at the same time endeavouring, \nI am told, to sit down in the pool.  Finding that I was quite \ninsensible, and for the time a maniac, he humanely conducted me \nbelow.\n\nThere I remained until I got better:  suffering, whenever I was \nrecommended to eat anything, an amount of anguish only second to \nthat which is said to be endured by the apparently drowned, in the \nprocess of restoration to life.  One gentleman on board had a \nletter of introduction to me from a mutual friend in London.  He \nsent it below with his card, on the morning of the head-wind; and I \nwas long troubled with the idea that he might be up, and well, and \na hundred times a day expecting me to call upon him in the saloon.  \nI imagined him one of those cast-iron images - I will not call them \nmen - who ask, with red faces, and lusty voices, what sea-sickness \nmeans, and whether it really is as bad as it is represented to be.  \nThis was very torturing indeed; and I don\'t think I ever felt such \nperfect gratification and gratitude of heart, as I did when I heard \nfrom the ship\'s doctor that he had been obliged to put a large \nmustard poultice on this very gentleman\'s stomach.  I date my \nrecovery from the receipt of that intelligence.\n\nIt was materially assisted though, I have no doubt, by a heavy gale \nof wind, which came slowly up at sunset, when we were about ten \ndays out, and raged with gradually increasing fury until morning, \nsaving that it lulled for an hour a little before midnight.  There \nwas something in the unnatural repose of that hour, and in the \nafter gathering of the storm, so inconceivably awful and \ntremendous, that its bursting into full violence was almost a \nrelief.\n\nThe labouring of the ship in the troubled sea on this night I shall \nnever forget.  \'Will it ever be worse than this?\' was a question I \nhad often heard asked, when everything was sliding and bumping \nabout, and when it certainly did seem difficult to comprehend the \npossibility of anything afloat being more disturbed, without \ntoppling over and going down.  But what the agitation of a steam-\nvessel is, on a bad winter\'s night in the wild Atlantic, it is \nimpossible for the most vivid imagination to conceive.  To say that \nshe is flung down on her side in the waves, with her masts dipping \ninto them, and that, springing up again, she rolls over on the \nother side, until a heavy sea strikes her with the noise of a \nhundred great guns, and hurls her back - that she stops, and \nstaggers, and shivers, as though stunned, and then, with a violent \nthrobbing at her heart, darts onward like a monster goaded into \nmadness, to be beaten down, and battered, and crushed, and leaped \non by the angry sea - that thunder, lightning, hail, and rain, and \nwind, are all in fierce contention for the mastery - that every \nplank has its groan, every nail its shriek, and every drop of water \nin the great ocean its howling voice - is nothing.  To say that all \nis grand, and all appalling and horrible in the last degree, is \nnothing.  Words cannot express it.  Thoughts cannot convey it.  \nOnly a dream can call it up again, in all its fury, rage, and \npassion.\n\nAnd yet, in the very midst of these terrors, I was placed in a \nsituation so exquisitely ridiculous, that even then I had as strong \na sense of its absurdity as I have now, and could no more help \nlaughing than I can at any other comical incident, happening under \ncircumstances the most favourable to its enjoyment.  About midnight \nwe shipped a sea, which forced its way through the skylights, burst \nopen the doors above, and came raging and roaring down into the \nladies\' cabin, to the unspeakable consternation of my wife and a \nlittle Scotch lady - who, by the way, had previously sent a message \nto the captain by the stewardess, requesting him, with her \ncompliments, to have a steel conductor immediately attached to the \ntop of every mast, and to the chimney, in order that the ship might \nnot be struck by lightning.  They and the handmaid before \nmentioned, being in such ecstasies of fear that I scarcely knew \nwhat to do with them, I naturally bethought myself of some \nrestorative or comfortable cordial; and nothing better occurring to \nme, at the moment, than hot brandy-and-water, I procured a tumbler \nfull without delay.  It being impossible to stand or sit without \nholding on, they were all heaped together in one corner of a long \nsofa - a fixture extending entirely across the cabin - where they \nclung to each other in momentary expectation of being drowned.  \nWhen I approached this place with my specific, and was about to \nadminister it with many consolatory expressions to the nearest \nsufferer, what was my dismay to see them all roll slowly down to \nthe other end!  And when I staggered to that end, and held out the \nglass once more, how immensely baffled were my good intentions by \nthe ship giving another lurch, and their all rolling back again!  I \nsuppose I dodged them up and down this sofa for at least a quarter \nof an hour, without reaching them once; and by the time I did catch \nthem, the brandy-and-water was diminished, by constant spilling, to \na teaspoonful.  To complete the group, it is necessary to recognise \nin this disconcerted dodger, an individual very pale from sea-\nsickness, who had shaved his beard and brushed his hair, last, at \nLiverpool:  and whose only article of dress (linen not included) \nwere a pair of dreadnought trousers; a blue jacket, formerly \nadmired upon the Thames at Richmond; no stockings; and one slipper.\n\nOf the outrageous antics performed by that ship next morning; which \nmade bed a practical joke, and getting up, by any process short of \nfalling out, an impossibility; I say nothing.  But anything like \nthe utter dreariness and desolation that met my eyes when I \nliterally \'tumbled up\' on deck at noon, I never saw.  Ocean and sky \nwere all of one dull, heavy, uniform, lead colour.  There was no \nextent of prospect even over the dreary waste that lay around us, \nfor the sea ran high, and the horizon encompassed us like a large \nblack hoop.  Viewed from the air, or some tall bluff on shore, it \nwould have been imposing and stupendous, no doubt; but seen from \nthe wet and rolling decks, it only impressed one giddily and \npainfully.  In the gale of last night the life-boat had been \ncrushed by one blow of the sea like a walnut-shell; and there it \nhung dangling in the air:  a mere faggot of crazy boards.  The \nplanking of the paddle-boxes had been torn sheer away.  The wheels \nwere exposed and bare; and they whirled and dashed their spray \nabout the decks at random.  Chimney, white with crusted salt; \ntopmasts struck; storm-sails set; rigging all knotted, tangled, \nwet, and drooping:  a gloomier picture it would be hard to look \nupon.\n\nI was now comfortably established by courtesy in the ladies\' cabin, \nwhere, besides ourselves, there were only four other passengers.  \nFirst, the little Scotch lady before mentioned, on her way to join \nher husband at New York, who had settled there three years before.  \nSecondly and thirdly, an honest young Yorkshireman, connected with \nsome American house; domiciled in that same city, and carrying \nthither his beautiful young wife to whom he had been married but a \nfortnight, and who was the fairest specimen of a comely English \ncountry girl I have ever seen.  Fourthy, fifthly, and lastly, \nanother couple:  newly married too, if one might judge from the \nendearments they frequently interchanged:  of whom I know no more \nthan that they were rather a mysterious, run-away kind of couple; \nthat the lady had great personal attractions also; and that the \ngentleman carried more guns with him than Robinson Crusoe, wore a \nshooting-coat, and had two great dogs on board.  On further \nconsideration, I remember that he tried hot roast pig and bottled \nale as a cure for sea-sickness; and that he took these remedies \n(usually in bed) day after day, with astonishing perseverance.  I \nmay add, for the information of the curious, that they decidedly \nfailed.\n\nThe weather continuing obstinately and almost unprecedentedly bad, \nwe usually straggled into this cabin, more or less faint and \nmiserable, about an hour before noon, and lay down on the sofas to \nrecover; during which interval, the captain would look in to \ncommunicate the state of the wind, the moral certainty of its \nchanging to-morrow (the weather is always going to improve to-\nmorrow, at sea), the vessel\'s rate of sailing, and so forth.  \nObservations there were none to tell us of, for there was no sun to \ntake them by.  But a description of one day will serve for all the \nrest.  Here it is.\n\nThe captain being gone, we compose ourselves to read, if the place \nbe light enough; and if not, we doze and talk alternately.  At one, \na bell rings, and the stewardess comes down with a steaming dish of \nbaked potatoes, and another of roasted apples; and plates of pig\'s \nface, cold ham, salt beef; or perhaps a smoking mess of rare hot \ncollops.  We fall to upon these dainties; eat as much as we can (we \nhave great appetites now); and are as long as possible about it.  \nIf the fire will burn (it WILL sometimes) we are pretty cheerful.  \nIf it won\'t, we all remark to each other that it\'s very cold, rub \nour hands, cover ourselves with coats and cloaks, and lie down \nagain to doze, talk, and read (provided as aforesaid), until \ndinner-time.  At five, another bell rings, and the stewardess \nreappears with another dish of potatoes - boiled this time - and \nstore of hot meat of various kinds:  not forgetting the roast pig, \nto be taken medicinally.  We sit down at table again (rather more \ncheerfully than before); prolong the meal with a rather mouldy \ndessert of apples, grapes, and oranges; and drink our wine and \nbrandy-and-water.  The bottles and glasses are still upon the \ntable, and the oranges and so forth are rolling about according to \ntheir fancy and the ship\'s way, when the doctor comes down, by \nspecial nightly invitation, to join our evening rubber:  \nimmediately on whose arrival we make a party at whist, and as it is \na rough night and the cards will not lie on the cloth, we put the \ntricks in our pockets as we take them.  At whist we remain with \nexemplary gravity (deducting a short time for tea and toast) until \neleven o\'clock, or thereabouts; when the captain comes down again, \nin a sou\'-wester hat tied under his chin, and a pilot-coat:  making \nthe ground wet where he stands.  By this time the card-playing is \nover, and the bottles and glasses are again upon the table; and \nafter an hour\'s pleasant conversation about the ship, the \npassengers, and things in general, the captain (who never goes to \nbed, and is never out of humour) turns up his coat collar for the \ndeck again; shakes hands all round; and goes laughing out into the \nweather as merrily as to a birthday party.\n\nAs to daily news, there is no dearth of that commodity.  This \npassenger is reported to have lost fourteen pounds at Vingt-et-un \nin the saloon yesterday; and that passenger drinks his bottle of \nchampagne every day, and how he does it (being only a clerk), \nnobody knows.  The head engineer has distinctly said that there \nnever was such times - meaning weather - and four good hands are \nill, and have given in, dead beat.  Several berths are full of \nwater, and all the cabins are leaky.  The ship\'s cook, secretly \nswigging damaged whiskey, has been found drunk; and has been played \nupon by the fire-engine until quite sober.  All the stewards have \nfallen down-stairs at various dinner-times, and go about with \nplasters in various places.  The baker is ill, and so is the \npastry-cook.  A new man, horribly indisposed, has been required to \nfill the place of the latter officer; and has been propped and \njammed up with empty casks in a little house upon deck, and \ncommanded to roll out pie-crust, which he protests (being highly \nbilious) it is death to him to look at.  News!  A dozen murders on \nshore would lack the interest of these slight incidents at sea.\n\nDivided between our rubber and such topics as these, we were \nrunning (as we thought) into Halifax Harbour, on the fifteenth \nnight, with little wind and a bright moon - indeed, we had made the \nLight at its outer entrance, and put the pilot in charge - when \nsuddenly the ship struck upon a bank of mud.  An immediate rush on \ndeck took place of course; the sides were crowded in an instant; \nand for a few minutes we were in as lively a state of confusion as \nthe greatest lover of disorder would desire to see.  The \npassengers, and guns, and water-casks, and other heavy matters, \nbeing all huddled together aft, however, to lighten her in the \nhead, she was soon got off; and after some driving on towards an \nuncomfortable line of objects (whose vicinity had been announced \nvery early in the disaster by a loud cry of \'Breakers a-head!\') and \nmuch backing of paddles, and heaving of the lead into a constantly \ndecreasing depth of water, we dropped anchor in a strange \noutlandish-looking nook which nobody on board could recognise, \nalthough there was land all about us, and so close that we could \nplainly see the waving branches of the trees.\n\nIt was strange enough, in the silence of midnight, and the dead \nstillness that seemed to be created by the sudden and unexpected \nstoppage of the engine which had been clanking and blasting in our \nears incessantly for so many days, to watch the look of blank \nastonishment expressed in every face:  beginning with the officers, \ntracing it through all the passengers, and descending to the very \nstokers and furnacemen, who emerged from below, one by one, and \nclustered together in a smoky group about the hatchway of the \nengine-room, comparing notes in whispers.  After throwing up a few \nrockets and firing signal guns in the hope of being hailed from the \nland, or at least of seeing a light - but without any other sight \nor sound presenting itself - it was determined to send a boat on \nshore.  It was amusing to observe how very kind some of the \npassengers were, in volunteering to go ashore in this same boat:  \nfor the general good, of course:  not by any means because they \nthought the ship in an unsafe position, or contemplated the \npossibility of her heeling over in case the tide were running out.  \nNor was it less amusing to remark how desperately unpopular the \npoor pilot became in one short minute.  He had had his passage out \nfrom Liverpool, and during the whole voyage had been quite a \nnotorious character, as a teller of anecdotes and cracker of jokes.  \nYet here were the very men who had laughed the loudest at his \njests, now flourishing their fists in his face, loading him with \nimprecations, and defying him to his teeth as a villain!\n\nThe boat soon shoved off, with a lantern and sundry blue lights on \nboard; and in less than an hour returned; the officer in command \nbringing with him a tolerably tall young tree, which he had plucked \nup by the roots, to satisfy certain distrustful passengers whose \nminds misgave them that they were to be imposed upon and \nshipwrecked, and who would on no other terms believe that he had \nbeen ashore, or had done anything but fraudulently row a little way \ninto the mist, specially to deceive them and compass their deaths.  \nOur captain had foreseen from the first that we must be in a place \ncalled the Eastern passage; and so we were.  It was about the last \nplace in the world in which we had any business or reason to be, \nbut a sudden fog, and some error on the pilot\'s part, were the \ncause.  We were surrounded by banks, and rocks, and shoals of all \nkinds, but had happily drifted, it seemed, upon the only safe speck \nthat was to be found thereabouts.  Eased by this report, and by the \nassurance that the tide was past the ebb, we turned in at three \no\'clock in the morning.\n\nI was dressing about half-past nine next day, when the noise above \nhurried me on deck.  When I had left it overnight, it was dark, \nfoggy, and damp, and there were bleak hills all round us.  Now, we \nwere gliding down a smooth, broad stream, at the rate of eleven \nmiles an hour:  our colours flying gaily; our crew rigged out in \ntheir smartest clothes; our officers in uniform again; the sun \nshining as on a brilliant April day in England; the land stretched \nout on either side, streaked with light patches of snow; white \nwooden houses; people at their doors; telegraphs working; flags \nhoisted; wharfs appearing; ships; quays crowded with people; \ndistant noises; shouts; men and boys running down steep places \ntowards the pier:  all more bright and gay and fresh to our unused \neyes than words can paint them.  We came to a wharf, paved with \nuplifted faces; got alongside, and were made fast, after some \nshouting and straining of cables; darted, a score of us along the \ngangway, almost as soon as it was thrust out to meet us, and before \nit had reached the ship - and leaped upon the firm glad earth \nagain!\n\nI suppose this Halifax would have appeared an Elysium, though it \nhad been a curiosity of ugly dulness.  But I carried away with me a \nmost pleasant impression of the town and its inhabitants, and have \npreserved it to this hour.  Nor was it without regret that I came \nhome, without having found an opportunity of returning thither, and \nonce more shaking hands with the friends I made that day.\n\nIt happened to be the opening of the Legislative Council and \nGeneral Assembly, at which ceremonial the forms observed on the \ncommencement of a new Session of Parliament in England were so \nclosely copied, and so gravely presented on a small scale, that it \nwas like looking at Westminster through the wrong end of a \ntelescope.  The governor, as her Majesty\'s representative, \ndelivered what may be called the Speech from the Throne.  He said \nwhat he had to say manfully and well.  The military band outside \nthe building struck up \"God save the Queen\" with great vigour \nbefore his Excellency had quite finished; the people shouted; the \nin\'s rubbed their hands; the out\'s shook their heads; the \nGovernment party said there never was such a good speech; the \nOpposition declared there never was such a bad one; the Speaker and \nmembers of the House of Assembly withdrew from the bar to say a \ngreat deal among themselves and do a little:  and, in short, \neverything went on, and promised to go on, just as it does at home \nupon the like occasions.\n\nThe town is built on the side of a hill, the highest point being \ncommanded by a strong fortress, not yet quite finished.  Several \nstreets of good breadth and appearance extend from its summit to \nthe water-side, and are intersected by cross streets running \nparallel with the river.  The houses are chiefly of wood.  The \nmarket is abundantly supplied; and provisions are exceedingly \ncheap.  The weather being unusually mild at that time for the \nseason of the year, there was no sleighing:  but there were plenty \nof those vehicles in yards and by-places, and some of them, from \nthe gorgeous quality of their decorations, might have \'gone on\' \nwithout alteration as triumphal cars in a melodrama at Astley\'s.  \nThe day was uncommonly fine; the air bracing and healthful; the \nwhole aspect of the town cheerful, thriving, and industrious.\n\nWe lay there seven hours, to deliver and exchange the mails.  At \nlength, having collected all our bags and all our passengers \n(including two or three choice spirits, who, having indulged too \nfreely in oysters and champagne, were found lying insensible on \ntheir backs in unfrequented streets), the engines were again put in \nmotion, and we stood off for Boston.\n\nEncountering squally weather again in the Bay of Fundy, we tumbled \nand rolled about as usual all that night and all next day.  On the \nnext afternoon, that is to say, on Saturday, the twenty-second of \nJanuary, an American pilot-boat came alongside, and soon afterwards \nthe Britannia steam-packet, from Liverpool, eighteen days out, was \ntelegraphed at Boston.\n\nThe indescribable interest with which I strained my eyes, as the \nfirst patches of American soil peeped like molehills from the green \nsea, and followed them, as they swelled, by slow and almost \nimperceptible degrees, into a continuous line of coast, can hardly \nbe exaggerated.  A sharp keen wind blew dead against us; a hard \nfrost prevailed on shore; and the cold was most severe.  Yet the \nair was so intensely clear, and dry, and bright, that the \ntemperature was not only endurable, but delicious.\n\nHow I remained on deck, staring about me, until we came alongside \nthe dock, and how, though I had had as many eyes as Argus, I should \nhave had them all wide open, and all employed on new objects - are \ntopics which I will not prolong this chapter to discuss.  Neither \nwill I more than hint at my foreigner-like mistake in supposing \nthat a party of most active persons, who scrambled on board at the \nperil of their lives as we approached the wharf, were newsmen, \nanswering to that industrious class at home; whereas, despite the \nleathern wallets of news slung about the necks of some, and the \nbroad sheets in the hands of all, they were Editors, who boarded \nships in person (as one gentleman in a worsted comforter informed \nme), \'because they liked the excitement of it.\'  Suffice it in this \nplace to say, that one of these invaders, with a ready courtesy for \nwhich I thank him here most gratefully, went on before to order \nrooms at the hotel; and that when I followed, as I soon did, I \nfound myself rolling through the long passages with an involuntary \nimitation of the gait of Mr. T. P. Cooke, in a new nautical \nmelodrama.\n\n\'Dinner, if you please,\' said I to the waiter.\n\n\'When?\' said the waiter.\n\n\'As quick as possible,\' said I.\n\n\'Right away?\' said the waiter.\n\nAfter a moment\'s hesitation, I answered \'No,\' at hazard.\n\n\'NOT right away?\' cried the waiter, with an amount of surprise that \nmade me start.\n\nI looked at him doubtfully, and returned, \'No; I would rather have \nit in this private room.  I like it very much.\'\n\nAt this, I really thought the waiter must have gone out of his \nmind:  as I believe he would have done, but for the interposition \nof another man, who whispered in his ear, \'Directly.\'\n\n\'Well! and that\'s a fact!\' said the waiter, looking helplessly at \nme:  \'Right away.\'\n\nI saw now that \'Right away\' and \'Directly\' were one and the same \nthing.  So I reversed my previous answer, and sat down to dinner in \nten minutes afterwards; and a capital dinner it was.\n\nThe hotel (a very excellent one) is called the Tremont House.  It \nhas more galleries, colonnades, piazzas, and passages than I can \nremember, or the reader would believe.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III - BOSTON\n\n\n\nIN all the public establishments of America, the utmost courtesy \nprevails.  Most of our Departments are susceptible of considerable \nimprovement in this respect, but the Custom-house above all others \nwould do well to take example from the United States and render \nitself somewhat less odious and offensive to foreigners.  The \nservile rapacity of the French officials is sufficiently \ncontemptible; but there is a surly boorish incivility about our \nmen, alike disgusting to all persons who fall into their hands, and \ndiscreditable to the nation that keeps such ill-conditioned curs \nsnarling about its gates.\n\nWhen I landed in America, I could not help being strongly impressed \nwith the contrast their Custom-house presented, and the attention, \npoliteness and good humour with which its officers discharged their \nduty.\n\nAs we did not land at Boston, in consequence of some detention at \nthe wharf, until after dark, I received my first impressions of the \ncity in walking down to the Custom-house on the morning after our \narrival, which was Sunday.  I am afraid to say, by the way, how \nmany offers of pews and seats in church for that morning were made \nto us, by formal note of invitation, before we had half finished \nour first dinner in America, but if I may be allowed to make a \nmoderate guess, without going into nicer calculation, I should say \nthat at least as many sittings were proffered us, as would have \naccommodated a score or two of grown-up families.  The number of \ncreeds and forms of religion to which the pleasure of our company \nwas requested, was in very fair proportion.\n\nNot being able, in the absence of any change of clothes, to go to \nchurch that day, we were compelled to decline these kindnesses, one \nand all; and I was reluctantly obliged to forego the delight of \nhearing Dr. Channing, who happened to preach that morning for the \nfirst time in a very long interval.  I mention the name of this \ndistinguished and accomplished man (with whom I soon afterwards had \nthe pleasure of becoming personally acquainted), that I may have \nthe gratification of recording my humble tribute of admiration and \nrespect for his high abilities and character; and for the bold \nphilanthropy with which he has ever opposed himself to that most \nhideous blot and foul disgrace - Slavery.\n\nTo return to Boston.  When I got into the streets upon this Sunday \nmorning, the air was so clear, the houses were so bright and gay:  \nthe signboards were painted in such gaudy colours; the gilded \nletters were so very golden; the bricks were so very red, the stone \nwas so very white, the blinds and area railings were so very green, \nthe knobs and plates upon the street doors so marvellously bright \nand twinkling; and all so slight and unsubstantial in appearance - \nthat every thoroughfare in the city looked exactly like a scene in \na pantomime.  It rarely happens in the business streets that a \ntradesman, if I may venture to call anybody a tradesman, where \neverybody is a merchant, resides above his store; so that many \noccupations are often carried on in one house, and the whole front \nis covered with boards and inscriptions.  As I walked along, I kept \nglancing up at these boards, confidently expecting to see a few of \nthem change into something; and I never turned a corner suddenly \nwithout looking out for the clown and pantaloon, who, I had no \ndoubt, were hiding in a doorway or behind some pillar close at \nhand.  As to Harlequin and Columbine, I discovered immediately that \nthey lodged (they are always looking after lodgings in a pantomime) \nat a very small clockmaker\'s one story high, near the hotel; which, \nin addition to various symbols and devices, almost covering the \nwhole front, had a great dial hanging out - to be jumped through, \nof course.\n\nThe suburbs are, if possible, even more unsubstantial-looking than \nthe city.  The white wooden houses (so white that it makes one wink \nto look at them), with their green jalousie blinds, are so \nsprinkled and dropped about in all directions, without seeming to \nhave any root at all in the ground; and the small churches and \nchapels are so prim, and bright, and highly varnished; that I \nalmost believed the whole affair could be taken up piecemeal like a \nchild\'s toy, and crammed into a little box.\n\nThe city is a beautiful one, and cannot fail, I should imagine, to \nimpress all strangers very favourably.  The private dwelling-houses \nare, for the most part, large and elegant; the shops extremely \ngood; and the public buildings handsome.  The State House is built \nupon the summit of a hill, which rises gradually at first, and \nafterwards by a steep ascent, almost from the water\'s edge.  In \nfront is a green enclosure, called the Common.  The site is \nbeautiful:  and from the top there is a charming panoramic view of \nthe whole town and neighbourhood.  In addition to a variety of \ncommodious offices, it contains two handsome chambers; in one the \nHouse of Representatives of the State hold their meetings:  in the \nother, the Senate.  Such proceedings as I saw here, were conducted \nwith perfect gravity and decorum; and were certainly calculated to \ninspire attention and respect.\n\nThere is no doubt that much of the intellectual refinement and \nsuperiority of Boston, is referable to the quiet influence of the \nUniversity of Cambridge, which is within three or four miles of the \ncity.  The resident professors at that university are gentlemen of \nlearning and varied attainments; and are, without one exception \nthat I can call to mind, men who would shed a grace upon, and do \nhonour to, any society in the civilised world.  Many of the \nresident gentry in Boston and its neighbourhood, and I think I am \nnot mistaken in adding, a large majority of those who are attached \nto the liberal professions there, have been educated at this same \nschool.  Whatever the defects of American universities may be, they \ndisseminate no prejudices; rear no bigots; dig up the buried ashes \nof no old superstitions; never interpose between the people and \ntheir improvement; exclude no man because of his religious \nopinions; above all, in their whole course of study and \ninstruction, recognise a world, and a broad one too, lying beyond \nthe college walls.\n\nIt was a source of inexpressible pleasure to me to observe the \nalmost imperceptible, but not less certain effect, wrought by this \ninstitution among the small community of Boston; and to note at \nevery turn the humanising tastes and desires it has engendered; the \naffectionate friendships to which it has given rise; the amount of \nvanity and prejudice it has dispelled.  The golden calf they \nworship at Boston is a pigmy compared with the giant effigies set \nup in other parts of that vast counting-house which lies beyond the \nAtlantic; and the almighty dollar sinks into something \ncomparatively insignificant, amidst a whole Pantheon of better \ngods.\n\nAbove all, I sincerely believe that the public institutions and \ncharities of this capital of Massachusetts are as nearly perfect, \nas the most considerate wisdom, benevolence, and humanity, can make \nthem.  I never in my life was more affected by the contemplation of \nhappiness, under circumstances of privation and bereavement, than \nin my visits to these establishments.\n\nIt is a great and pleasant feature of all such institutions in \nAmerica, that they are either supported by the State or assisted by \nthe State; or (in the event of their not needing its helping hand) \nthat they act in concert with it, and are emphatically the \npeople\'s.  I cannot but think, with a view to the principle and its \ntendency to elevate or depress the character of the industrious \nclasses, that a Public Charity is immeasurably better than a \nPrivate Foundation, no matter how munificently the latter may be \nendowed.  In our own country, where it has not, until within these \nlater days, been a very popular fashion with governments to display \nany extraordinary regard for the great mass of the people or to \nrecognise their existence as improvable creatures, private \ncharities, unexampled in the history of the earth, have arisen, to \ndo an incalculable amount of good among the destitute and \nafflicted.  But the government of the country, having neither act \nnor part in them, is not in the receipt of any portion of the \ngratitude they inspire; and, offering very little shelter or relief \nbeyond that which is to be found in the workhouse and the jail, has \ncome, not unnaturally, to be looked upon by the poor rather as a \nstern master, quick to correct and punish, than a kind protector, \nmerciful and vigilant in their hour of need.\n\nThe maxim that out of evil cometh good, is strongly illustrated by \nthese establishments at home; as the records of the Prerogative \nOffice in Doctors\' Commons can abundantly prove.  Some immensely \nrich old gentleman or lady, surrounded by needy relatives, makes, \nupon a low average, a will a-week.  The old gentleman or lady, \nnever very remarkable in the best of times for good temper, is full \nof aches and pains from head to foot; full of fancies and caprices; \nfull of spleen, distrust, suspicion, and dislike.  To cancel old \nwills, and invent new ones, is at last the sole business of such a \ntestator\'s existence; and relations and friends (some of whom have \nbeen bred up distinctly to inherit a large share of the property, \nand have been, from their cradles, specially disqualified from \ndevoting themselves to any useful pursuit, on that account) are so \noften and so unexpectedly and summarily cut off, and reinstated, \nand cut off again, that the whole family, down to the remotest \ncousin, is kept in a perpetual fever.  At length it becomes plain \nthat the old lady or gentleman has not long to live; and the \nplainer this becomes, the more clearly the old lady or gentleman \nperceives that everybody is in a conspiracy against their poor old \ndying relative; wherefore the old lady or gentleman makes another \nlast will - positively the last this time - conceals the same in a \nchina teapot, and expires next day.  Then it turns out, that the \nwhole of the real and personal estate is divided between half-a-\ndozen charities; and that the dead and gone testator has in pure \nspite helped to do a great deal of good, at the cost of an immense \namount of evil passion and misery.\n\nThe Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind, at \nBoston, is superintended by a body of trustees who make an annual \nreport to the corporation.  The indigent blind of that state are \nadmitted gratuitously.  Those from the adjoining state of \nConnecticut, or from the states of Maine, Vermont, or New \nHampshire, are admitted by a warrant from the state to which they \nrespectively belong; or, failing that, must find security among \ntheir friends, for the payment of about twenty pounds English for \ntheir first year\'s board and instruction, and ten for the second.  \n\'After the first year,\' say the trustees, \'an account current will \nbe opened with each pupil; he will be charged with the actual cost \nof his board, which will not exceed two dollars per week;\' a trifle \nmore than eight shillings English; \'and he will be credited with \nthe amount paid for him by the state, or by his friends; also with \nhis earnings over and above the cost of the stock which he uses; so \nthat all his earnings over one dollar per week will be his own.  By \nthe third year it will be known whether his earnings will more than \npay the actual cost of his board; if they should, he will have it \nat his option to remain and receive his earnings, or not.  Those \nwho prove unable to earn their own livelihood will not be retained; \nas it is not desirable to convert the establishment into an alms-\nhouse, or to retain any but working bees in the hive.  Those who by \nphysical or mental imbecility are disqualified from work, are \nthereby disqualified from being members of an industrious \ncommunity; and they can be better provided for in establishments \nfitted for the infirm.\'\n\nI went to see this place one very fine winter morning:  an Italian \nsky above, and the air so clear and bright on every side, that even \nmy eyes, which are none of the best, could follow the minute lines \nand scraps of tracery in distant buildings.  Like most other public \ninstitutions in America, of the same class, it stands a mile or two \nwithout the town, in a cheerful healthy spot; and is an airy, \nspacious, handsome edifice.  It is built upon a height, commanding \nthe harbour.  When I paused for a moment at the door, and marked \nhow fresh and free the whole scene was - what sparkling bubbles \nglanced upon the waves, and welled up every moment to the surface, \nas though the world below, like that above, were radiant with the \nbright day, and gushing over in its fulness of light:  when I gazed \nfrom sail to sail away upon a ship at sea, a tiny speck of shining \nwhite, the only cloud upon the still, deep, distant blue - and, \nturning, saw a blind boy with his sightless face addressed that \nway, as though he too had some sense within him of the glorious \ndistance:  I felt a kind of sorrow that the place should be so very \nlight, and a strange wish that for his sake it were darker.  It was \nbut momentary, of course, and a mere fancy, but I felt it keenly \nfor all that.\n\nThe children were at their daily tasks in different rooms, except a \nfew who were already dismissed, and were at play.  Here, as in many \ninstitutions, no uniform is worn; and I was very glad of it, for \ntwo reasons.  Firstly, because I am sure that nothing but senseless \ncustom and want of thought would reconcile us to the liveries and \nbadges we are so fond of at home.  Secondly, because the absence of \nthese things presents each child to the visitor in his or her own \nproper character, with its individuality unimpaired; not lost in a \ndull, ugly, monotonous repetition of the same unmeaning garb:  \nwhich is really an important consideration.  The wisdom of \nencouraging a little harmless pride in personal appearance even \namong the blind, or the whimsical absurdity of considering charity \nand leather breeches inseparable companions, as we do, requires no \ncomment.\n\nGood order, cleanliness, and comfort, pervaded every corner of the \nbuilding.  The various classes, who were gathered round their \nteachers, answered the questions put to them with readiness and \nintelligence, and in a spirit of cheerful contest for precedence \nwhich pleased me very much.  Those who were at play, were gleesome \nand noisy as other children.  More spiritual and affectionate \nfriendships appeared to exist among them, than would be found among \nother young persons suffering under no deprivation; but this I \nexpected and was prepared to find.  It is a part of the great \nscheme of Heaven\'s merciful consideration for the afflicted.\n\nIn a portion of the building, set apart for that purpose, are work-\nshops for blind persons whose education is finished, and who have \nacquired a trade, but who cannot pursue it in an ordinary \nmanufactory because of their deprivation.  Several people were at \nwork here; making brushes, mattresses, and so forth; and the \ncheerfulness, industry, and good order discernible in every other \npart of the building, extended to this department also.\n\nOn the ringing of a bell, the pupils all repaired, without any \nguide or leader, to a spacious music-hall, where they took their \nseats in an orchestra erected for that purpose, and listened with \nmanifest delight to a voluntary on the organ, played by one of \nthemselves.  At its conclusion, the performer, a boy of nineteen or \ntwenty, gave place to a girl; and to her accompaniment they all \nsang a hymn, and afterwards a sort of chorus.  It was very sad to \nlook upon and hear them, happy though their condition \nunquestionably was; and I saw that one blind girl, who (being for \nthe time deprived of the use of her limbs, by illness) sat close \nbeside me with her face towards them, wept silently the while she \nlistened.\n\nIt is strange to watch the faces of the blind, and see how free \nthey are from all concealment of what is passing in their thoughts; \nobserving which, a man with eyes may blush to contemplate the mask \nhe wears.  Allowing for one shade of anxious expression which is \nnever absent from their countenances, and the like of which we may \nreadily detect in our own faces if we try to feel our way in the \ndark, every idea, as it rises within them, is expressed with the \nlightning\'s speed and nature\'s truth.  If the company at a rout, or \ndrawing-room at court, could only for one time be as unconscious of \nthe eyes upon them as blind men and women are, what secrets would \ncome out, and what a worker of hypocrisy this sight, the loss of \nwhich we so much pity, would appear to be!\n\nThe thought occurred to me as I sat down in another room, before a \ngirl, blind, deaf, and dumb; destitute of smell; and nearly so of \ntaste:  before a fair young creature with every human faculty, and \nhope, and power of goodness and affection, inclosed within her \ndelicate frame, and but one outward sense - the sense of touch.  \nThere she was, before me; built up, as it were, in a marble cell, \nimpervious to any ray of light, or particle of sound; with her poor \nwhite hand peeping through a chink in the wall, beckoning to some \ngood man for help, that an Immortal soul might be awakened.\n\nLong before I looked upon her, the help had come.  Her face was \nradiant with intelligence and pleasure.  Her hair, braided by her \nown hands, was bound about a head, whose intellectual capacity and \ndevelopment were beautifully expressed in its graceful outline, and \nits broad open brow; her dress, arranged by herself, was a pattern \nof neatness and simplicity; the work she had knitted, lay beside \nher; her writing-book was on the desk she leaned upon. - From the \nmournful ruin of such bereavement, there had slowly risen up this \ngentle, tender, guileless, grateful-hearted being.\n\nLike other inmates of that house, she had a green ribbon bound \nround her eyelids.  A doll she had dressed lay near upon the \nground.  I took it up, and saw that she had made a green fillet \nsuch as she wore herself, and fastened it about its mimic eyes.\n\nShe was seated in a little enclosure, made by school-desks and \nforms, writing her daily journal.  But soon finishing this pursuit, \nshe engaged in an animated conversation with a teacher who sat \nbeside her.  This was a favourite mistress with the poor pupil.  If \nshe could see the face of her fair instructress, she would not love \nher less, I am sure.\n\nI have extracted a few disjointed fragments of her history, from an \naccount, written by that one man who has made her what she is.  It \nis a very beautiful and touching narrative; and I wish I could \npresent it entire.\n\nHer name is Laura Bridgman.  \'She was born in Hanover, New \nHampshire, on the twenty-first of December, 1829.  She is described \nas having been a very sprightly and pretty infant, with bright blue \neyes.  She was, however, so puny and feeble until she was a year \nand a half old, that her parents hardly hoped to rear her.  She was \nsubject to severe fits, which seemed to rack her frame almost \nbeyond her power of endurance:  and life was held by the feeblest \ntenure:  but when a year and a half old, she seemed to rally; the \ndangerous symptoms subsided; and at twenty months old, she was \nperfectly well.\n\n\'Then her mental powers, hitherto stinted in their growth, rapidly \ndeveloped themselves; and during the four months of health which \nshe enjoyed, she appears (making due allowance for a fond mother\'s \naccount) to have displayed a considerable degree of intelligence.\n\n\'But suddenly she sickened again; her disease raged with great \nviolence during five weeks, when her eyes and ears were inflamed, \nsuppurated, and their contents were discharged.  But though sight \nand hearing were gone for ever, the poor child\'s sufferings were \nnot ended.  The fever raged during seven weeks; for five months she \nwas kept in bed in a darkened room; it was a year before she could \nwalk unsupported, and two years before she could sit up all day.  \nIt was now observed that her sense of smell was almost entirely \ndestroyed; and, consequently, that her taste was much blunted.\n\n\'It was not until four years of age that the poor child\'s bodily \nhealth seemed restored, and she was able to enter upon her \napprenticeship of life and the world.\n\n\'But what a situation was hers!  The darkness and the silence of \nthe tomb were around her:  no mother\'s smile called forth her \nanswering smile, no father\'s voice taught her to imitate his \nsounds:- they, brothers and sisters, were but forms of matter which \nresisted her touch, but which differed not from the furniture of \nthe house, save in warmth, and in the power of locomotion; and not \neven in these respects from the dog and the cat.\n\n\'But the immortal spirit which had been implanted within her could \nnot die, nor be maimed nor mutilated; and though most of its \navenues of communication with the world were cut off, it began to \nmanifest itself through the others.  As soon as she could walk, she \nbegan to explore the room, and then the house; she became familiar \nwith the form, density, weight, and heat, of every article she \ncould lay her hands upon.  She followed her mother, and felt her \nhands and arms, as she was occupied about the house; and her \ndisposition to imitate, led her to repeat everything herself.  She \neven learned to sew a little, and to knit.\'\n\nThe reader will scarcely need to be told, however, that the \nopportunities of communicating with her, were very, very limited; \nand that the moral effects of her wretched state soon began to \nappear.  Those who cannot be enlightened by reason, can only be \ncontrolled by force; and this, coupled with her great privations, \nmust soon have reduced her to a worse condition than that of the \nbeasts that perish, but for timely and unhoped-for aid.\n\n\'At this time, I was so fortunate as to hear of the child, and \nimmediately hastened to Hanover to see her.  I found her with a \nwell-formed figure; a strongly-marked, nervous-sanguine \ntemperament; a large and beautifully-shaped head; and the whole \nsystem in healthy action.  The parents were easily induced to \nconsent to her coming to Boston, and on the 4th of October, 1837, \nthey brought her to the Institution.\n\n\'For a while, she was much bewildered; and after waiting about two \nweeks, until she became acquainted with her new locality, and \nsomewhat familiar with the inmates, the attempt was made to give \nher knowledge of arbitrary signs, by which she could interchange \nthoughts with others.\n\n\'There was one of two ways to be adopted:  either to go on to build \nup a language of signs on the basis of the natural language which \nshe had already commenced herself, or to teach her the purely \narbitrary language in common use:  that is, to give her a sign for \nevery individual thing, or to give her a knowledge of letters by \ncombination of which she might express her idea of the existence, \nand the mode and condition of existence, of any thing.  The former \nwould have been easy, but very ineffectual; the latter seemed very \ndifficult, but, if accomplished, very effectual.  I determined \ntherefore to try the latter.\n\n\'The first experiments were made by taking articles in common use, \nsuch as knives, forks, spoons, keys, &c., and pasting upon them \nlabels with their names printed in raised letters.  These she felt \nvery carefully, and soon, of course, distinguished that the crooked \nlines SPOON, differed as much from the crooked lines KEY, as the \nspoon differed from the key in form.\n\n\'Then small detached labels, with the same words printed upon them, \nwere put into her hands; and she soon observed that they were \nsimilar to the ones pasted on the articles.\'  She showed her \nperception of this similarity by laying the label KEY upon the key, \nand the label SPOON upon the spoon.  She was encouraged here by the \nnatural sign of approbation, patting on the head.\n\n\'The same process was then repeated with all the articles which she \ncould handle; and she very easily learned to place the proper \nlabels upon them.  It was evident, however, that the only \nintellectual exercise was that of imitation and memory.  She \nrecollected that the label BOOK was placed upon a book, and she \nrepeated the process first from imitation, next from memory, with \nonly the motive of love of approbation, but apparently without the \nintellectual perception of any relation between the things.\n\n\'After a while, instead of labels, the individual letters were \ngiven to her on detached bits of paper:  they were arranged side by \nside so as to spell BOOK, KEY, &c.; then they were mixed up in a \nheap and a sign was made for her to arrange them herself so as to \nexpress the words BOOK, KEY, &c.; and she did so.\n\n\'Hitherto, the process had been mechanical, and the success about \nas great as teaching a very knowing dog a variety of tricks.  The \npoor child had sat in mute amazement, and patiently imitated \neverything her teacher did; but now the truth began to flash upon \nher:  her intellect began to work:  she perceived that here was a \nway by which she could herself make up a sign of anything that was \nin her own mind, and show it to another mind; and at once her \ncountenance lighted up with a human expression:  it was no longer a \ndog, or parrot:  it was an immortal spirit, eagerly seizing upon a \nnew link of union with other spirits!  I could almost fix upon the \nmoment when this truth dawned upon her mind, and spread its light \nto her countenance; I saw that the great obstacle was overcome; and \nthat henceforward nothing but patient and persevering, but plain \nand straightforward, efforts were to be used.\n\n\'The result thus far, is quickly related, and easily conceived; but \nnot so was the process; for many weeks of apparently unprofitable \nlabour were passed before it was effected.\n\n\'When it was said above that a sign was made, it was intended to \nsay, that the action was performed by her teacher, she feeling his \nhands, and then imitating the motion.\n\n\'The next step was to procure a set of metal types, with the \ndifferent letters of the alphabet cast upon their ends; also a \nboard, in which were square holes, into which holes she could set \nthe types; so that the letters on their ends could alone be felt \nabove the surface.\n\n\'Then, on any article being handed to her, for instance, a pencil, \nor a watch, she would select the component letters, and arrange \nthem on her board, and read them with apparent pleasure.\n\n\'She was exercised for several weeks in this way, until her \nvocabulary became extensive; and then the important step was taken \nof teaching her how to represent the different letters by the \nposition of her fingers, instead of the cumbrous apparatus of the \nboard and types.  She accomplished this speedily and easily, for \nher intellect had begun to work in aid of her teacher, and her \nprogress was rapid.\n\n\'This was the period, about three months after she had commenced, \nthat the first report of her case was made, in which it was stated \nthat \"she has just learned the manual alphabet, as used by the deaf \nmutes, and it is a subject of delight and wonder to see how \nrapidly, correctly, and eagerly, she goes on with her labours.  Her \nteacher gives her a new object, for instance, a pencil, first lets \nher examine it, and get an idea of its use, then teaches her how to \nspell it by making the signs for the letters with her own fingers:  \nthe child grasps her hand, and feels her fingers, as the different \nletters are formed; she turns her head a little on one side like a \nperson listening closely; her lips are apart; she seems scarcely to \nbreathe; and her countenance, at first anxious, gradually changes \nto a smile, as she comprehends the lesson.  She then holds up her \ntiny fingers, and spells the word in the manual alphabet; next, she \ntakes her types and arranges her letters; and last, to make sure \nthat she is right, she takes the whole of the types composing the \nword, and places them upon or in contact with the pencil, or \nwhatever the object may be.\"\n\n\'The whole of the succeeding year was passed in gratifying her \neager inquiries for the names of every object which she could \npossibly handle; in exercising her in the use of the manual \nalphabet; in extending in every possible way her knowledge of the \nphysical relations of things; and in proper care of her health.\n\n\'At the end of the year a report of her case was made, from which \nthe following is an extract.\n\n\'\"It has been ascertained beyond the possibility of doubt, that she \ncannot see a ray of light, cannot hear the least sound, and never \nexercises her sense of smell, if she have any.  Thus her mind \ndwells in darkness and stillness, as profound as that of a closed \ntomb at midnight.  Of beautiful sights, and sweet sounds, and \npleasant odours, she has no conception; nevertheless, she seems as \nhappy and playful as a bird or a lamb; and the employment of her \nintellectual faculties, or the acquirement of a new idea, gives her \na vivid pleasure, which is plainly marked in her expressive \nfeatures.  She never seems to repine, but has all the buoyancy and \ngaiety of childhood.  She is fond of fun and frolic, and when \nplaying with the rest of the children, her shrill laugh sounds \nloudest of the group.\n\n\'\"When left alone, she seems very happy if she have her knitting or \nsewing, and will busy herself for hours; if she have no occupation, \nshe evidently amuses herself by imaginary dialogues, or by \nrecalling past impressions; she counts with her fingers, or spells \nout names of things which she has recently learned, in the manual \nalphabet of the deaf mutes.  In this lonely self-communion she \nseems to reason, reflect, and argue; if she spell a word wrong with \nthe fingers of her right hand, she instantly strikes it with her \nleft, as her teacher does, in sign of disapprobation; if right, \nthen she pats herself upon the head, and looks pleased.  She \nsometimes purposely spells a word wrong with the left hand, looks \nroguish for a moment and laughs, and then with the right hand \nstrikes the left, as if to correct it.\n\n\'\"During the year she has attained great dexterity in the use of \nthe manual alphabet of the deaf mutes; and she spells out the words \nand sentences which she knows, so fast and so deftly, that only \nthose accustomed to this language can follow with the eye the rapid \nmotions of her fingers.\n\n\'\"But wonderful as is the rapidity with which she writes her \nthoughts upon the air, still more so is the ease and accuracy with \nwhich she reads the words thus written by another; grasping their \nhands in hers, and following every movement of their fingers, as \nletter after letter conveys their meaning to her mind.  It is in \nthis way that she converses with her blind playmates, and nothing \ncan more forcibly show the power of mind in forcing matter to its \npurpose than a meeting between them.  For if great talent and skill \nare necessary for two pantomimes to paint their thoughts and \nfeelings by the movements of the body, and the expression of the \ncountenance, how much greater the difficulty when darkness shrouds \nthem both, and the one can hear no sound.\n\n\'\"When Laura is walking through a passage-way, with her hands \nspread before her, she knows instantly every one she meets, and \npasses them with a sign of recognition:  but if it be a girl of her \nown age, and especially if it be one of her favourites, there is \ninstantly a bright smile of recognition, a twining of arms, a \ngrasping of hands, and a swift telegraphing upon the tiny fingers; \nwhose rapid evolutions convey the thoughts and feelings from the \noutposts of one mind to those of the other.  There are questions \nand answers, exchanges of joy or sorrow, there are kissings and \npartings, just as between little children with all their senses.\"\n\n\'During this year, and six months after she had left home, her \nmother came to visit her, and the scene of their meeting was an \ninteresting one.\n\n\'The mother stood some time, gazing with overflowing eyes upon her \nunfortunate child, who, all unconscious of her presence, was \nplaying about the room.  Presently Laura ran against her, and at \nonce began feeling her hands, examining her dress, and trying to \nfind out if she knew her; but not succeeding in this, she turned \naway as from a stranger, and the poor woman could not conceal the \npang she felt, at finding that her beloved child did not know her.\n\n\'She then gave Laura a string of beads which she used to wear at \nhome, which were recognised by the child at once, who, with much \njoy, put them around her neck, and sought me eagerly to say she \nunderstood the string was from her home.\n\n\'The mother now sought to caress her, but poor Laura repelled her, \npreferring to be with her acquaintances.\n\n\'Another article from home was now given her, and she began to look \nmuch interested; she examined the stranger much closer, and gave me \nto understand that she knew she came from Hanover; she even endured \nher caresses, but would leave her with indifference at the \nslightest signal.  The distress of the mother was now painful to \nbehold; for, although she had feared that she should not be \nrecognised, the painful reality of being treated with cold \nindifference by a darling child, was too much for woman\'s nature to \nbear.\n\n\'After a while, on the mother taking hold of her again, a vague \nidea seemed to flit across Laura\'s mind, that this could not be a \nstranger; she therefore felt her hands very eagerly, while her \ncountenance assumed an expression of intense interest; she became \nvery pale; and then suddenly red; hope seemed struggling with doubt \nand anxiety, and never were contending emotions more strongly \npainted upon the human face:  at this moment of painful \nuncertainty, the mother drew her close to her side, and kissed her \nfondly, when at once the truth flashed upon the child, and all \nmistrust and anxiety disappeared from her face, as with an \nexpression of exceeding joy she eagerly nestled to the bosom of her \nparent, and yielded herself to her fond embraces.\n\n\'After this, the beads were all unheeded; the playthings which were \noffered to her were utterly disregarded; her playmates, for whom \nbut a moment before she gladly left the stranger, now vainly strove \nto pull her from her mother; and though she yielded her usual \ninstantaneous obedience to my signal to follow me, it was evidently \nwith painful reluctance.  She clung close to me, as if bewildered \nand fearful; and when, after a moment, I took her to her mother, \nshe sprang to her arms, and clung to her with eager joy.\n\n\'The subsequent parting between them, showed alike the affection, \nthe intelligence, and the resolution of the child.\n\n\'Laura accompanied her mother to the door, clinging close to her \nall the way, until they arrived at the threshold, where she paused, \nand felt around, to ascertain who was near her.  Perceiving the \nmatron, of whom she is very fond, she grasped her with one hand, \nholding on convulsively to her mother with the other; and thus she \nstood for a moment:  then she dropped her mother\'s hand; put her \nhandkerchief to her eyes; and turning round, clung sobbing to the \nmatron; while her mother departed, with emotions as deep as those \nof her child.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n\'It has been remarked in former reports, that she can distinguish \ndifferent degrees of intellect in others, and that she soon \nregarded, almost with contempt, a new-comer, when, after a few \ndays, she discovered her weakness of mind.  This unamiable part of \nher character has been more strongly developed during the past \nyear.\n\n\'She chooses for her friends and companions, those children who are \nintelligent, and can talk best with her; and she evidently dislikes \nto be with those who are deficient in intellect, unless, indeed, \nshe can make them serve her purposes, which she is evidently \ninclined to do.  She takes advantage of them, and makes them wait \nupon her, in a manner that she knows she could not exact of others; \nand in various ways shows her Saxon blood.\n\n\'She is fond of having other children noticed and caressed by the \nteachers, and those whom she respects; but this must not be carried \ntoo far, or she becomes jealous.  She wants to have her share, \nwhich, if not the lion\'s, is the greater part; and if she does not \nget it, she says, \"MY MOTHER WILL LOVE ME.\"\n\n\'Her tendency to imitation is so strong, that it leads her to \nactions which must be entirely incomprehensible to her, and which \ncan give her no other pleasure than the gratification of an \ninternal faculty.  She has been known to sit for half an hour, \nholding a book before her sightless eyes, and moving her lips, as \nshe has observed seeing people do when reading.\n\n\'She one day pretended that her doll was sick; and went through all \nthe motions of tending it, and giving it medicine; she then put it \ncarefully to bed, and placed a bottle of hot water to its feet, \nlaughing all the time most heartily.  When I came home, she \ninsisted upon my going to see it, and feel its pulse; and when I \ntold her to put a blister on its back, she seemed to enjoy it \namazingly, and almost screamed with delight.\n\n\'Her social feelings, and her affections, are very strong; and when \nshe is sitting at work, or at her studies, by the side of one of \nher little friends, she will break off from her task every few \nmoments, to hug and kiss them with an earnestness and warmth that \nis touching to behold.\n\n\'When left alone, she occupies and apparently amuses herself, and \nseems quite contented; and so strong seems to be the natural \ntendency of thought to put on the garb of language, that she often \nsoliloquizes in the FINGER LANGUAGE, slow and tedious as it is.  \nBut it is only when alone, that she is quiet:  for if she becomes \nsensible of the presence of any one near her, she is restless until \nshe can sit close beside them, hold their hand, and converse with \nthem by signs.\n\n\'In her intellectual character it is pleasing to observe an \ninsatiable thirst for knowledge, and a quick perception of the \nrelations of things.  In her moral character, it is beautiful to \nbehold her continual gladness, her keen enjoyment of existence, her \nexpansive love, her unhesitating confidence, her sympathy with \nsuffering, her conscientiousness, truthfulness, and hopefulness.\'\n\nSuch are a few fragments from the simple but most interesting and \ninstructive history of Laura Bridgman.  The name of her great \nbenefactor and friend, who writes it, is Dr. Howe.  There are not \nmany persons, I hope and believe, who, after reading these \npassages, can ever hear that name with indifference.\n\nA further account has been published by Dr. Howe, since the report \nfrom which I have just quoted.  It describes her rapid mental \ngrowth and improvement during twelve months more, and brings her \nlittle history down to the end of last year.  It is very \nremarkable, that as we dream in words, and carry on imaginary \nconversations, in which we speak both for ourselves and for the \nshadows who appear to us in those visions of the night, so she, \nhaving no words, uses her finger alphabet in her sleep.  And it has \nbeen ascertained that when her slumber is broken, and is much \ndisturbed by dreams, she expresses her thoughts in an irregular and \nconfused manner on her fingers:  just as we should murmur and \nmutter them indistinctly, in the like circumstances.\n\nI turned over the leaves of her Diary, and found it written in a \nfair legible square hand, and expressed in terms which were quite \nintelligible without any explanation.  On my saying that I should \nlike to see her write again, the teacher who sat beside her, bade \nher, in their language, sign her name upon a slip of paper, twice \nor thrice.  In doing so, I observed that she kept her left hand \nalways touching, and following up, her right, in which, of course, \nshe held the pen.  No line was indicated by any contrivance, but \nshe wrote straight and freely.\n\nShe had, until now, been quite unconscious of the presence of \nvisitors; but, having her hand placed in that of the gentleman who \naccompanied me, she immediately expressed his name upon her \nteacher\'s palm.  Indeed her sense of touch is now so exquisite, \nthat having been acquainted with a person once, she can recognise \nhim or her after almost any interval.  This gentleman had been in \nher company, I believe, but very seldom, and certainly had not seen \nher for many months.  My hand she rejected at once, as she does \nthat of any man who is a stranger to her.  But she retained my \nwife\'s with evident pleasure, kissed her, and examed her dress with \na girl\'s curiosity and interest.\n\nShe was merry and cheerful, and showed much innocent playfulness in \nher intercourse with her teacher.  Her delight on recognising a \nfavourite playfellow and companion - herself a blind girl - who \nsilently, and with an equal enjoyment of the coming surprise, took \na seat beside her, was beautiful to witness.  It elicited from her \nat first, as other slight circumstances did twice or thrice during \nmy visit, an uncouth noise which was rather painful to hear.  But \nof her teacher touching her lips, she immediately desisted, and \nembraced her laughingly and affectionately.\n\nI had previously been into another chamber, where a number of blind \nboys were swinging, and climbing, and engaged in various sports.  \nThey all clamoured, as we entered, to the assistant-master, who \naccompanied us, \'Look at me, Mr. Hart!  Please, Mr. Hart, look at \nme!\' evincing, I thought, even in this, an anxiety peculiar to \ntheir condition, that their little feats of agility should be SEEN.  \nAmong them was a small laughing fellow, who stood aloof, \nentertaining himself with a gymnastic exercise for bringing the \narms and chest into play; which he enjoyed mightily; especially \nwhen, in thrusting out his right arm, he brought it into contact \nwith another boy.  Like Laura Bridgman, this young child was deaf, \nand dumb, and blind.\n\nDr. Howe\'s account of this pupil\'s first instruction is so very \nstriking, and so intimately connected with Laura herself, that I \ncannot refrain from a short extract.  I may premise that the poor \nboy\'s name is Oliver Caswell; that he is thirteen years of age; and \nthat he was in full possession of all his faculties, until three \nyears and four months old.  He was then attacked by scarlet fever; \nin four weeks became deaf; in a few weeks more, blind; in six \nmonths, dumb.  He showed his anxious sense of this last \ndeprivation, by often feeling the lips of other persons when they \nwere talking, and then putting his hand upon his own, as if to \nassure himself that he had them in the right position.\n\n\'His thirst for knowledge,\' says Dr. Howe, \'proclaimed itself as \nsoon as he entered the house, by his eager examination of \neverything he could feel or smell in his new location.  For \ninstance, treading upon the register of a furnace, he instantly \nstooped down, and began to feel it, and soon discovered the way in \nwhich the upper plate moved upon the lower one; but this was not \nenough for him, so lying down upon his face, he applied his tongue \nfirst to one, then to the other, and seemed to discover that they \nwere of different kinds of metal.\n\n\'His signs were expressive:  and the strictly natural language, \nlaughing, crying, sighing, kissing, embracing, &c., was perfect.\n\n\'Some of the analogical signs which (guided by his faculty of \nimitation) he had contrived, were comprehensible; such as the \nwaving motion of his hand for the motion of a boat, the circular \none for a wheel, &c.\n\n\'The first object was to break up the use of these signs and to \nsubstitute for them the use of purely arbitrary ones.\n\n\'Profiting by the experience I had gained in the other cases, I \nomitted several steps of the process before employed, and commenced \nat once with the finger language.  Taking, therefore, several \narticles having short names, such as key, cup, mug, &c., and with \nLaura for an auxiliary, I sat down, and taking his hand, placed it \nupon one of them, and then with my own, made the letters KEY.  He \nfelt my hands eagerly with both of his, and on my repeating the \nprocess, he evidently tried to imitate the motions of my fingers.  \nIn a few minutes he contrived to feel the motions of my fingers \nwith one hand, and holding out the other he tried to imitate them, \nlaughing most heartily when he succeeded.  Laura was by, interested \neven to agitation; and the two presented a singular sight:  her \nface was flushed and anxious, and her fingers twining in among ours \nso closely as to follow every motion, but so slightly as not to \nembarrass them; while Oliver stood attentive, his head a little \naside, his face turned up, his left hand grasping mine, and his \nright held out:  at every motion of my fingers his countenance \nbetokened keen attention; there was an expression of anxiety as he \ntried to imitate the motions; then a smile came stealing out as he \nthought he could do so, and spread into a joyous laugh the moment \nhe succeeded, and felt me pat his head, and Laura clap him heartily \nupon the back, and jump up and down in her joy.\n\n\'He learned more than a half-dozen letters in half an hour, and \nseemed delighted with his success, at least in gaining approbation.  \nHis attention then began to flag, and I commenced playing with him.  \nIt was evident that in all this he had merely been imitating the \nmotions of my fingers, and placing his hand upon the key, cup, &c., \nas part of the process, without any perception of the relation \nbetween the sign and the object.\n\n\'When he was tired with play I took him back to the table, and he \nwas quite ready to begin again his process of imitation.  He soon \nlearned to make the letters for KEY, PEN, PIN; and by having the \nobject repeatedly placed in his hand, he at last perceived the \nrelation I wished to establish between them.  This was evident, \nbecause, when I made the letters PIN, or PEN, or CUP, he would \nselect the article.\n\n\'The perception of this relation was not accompanied by that \nradiant flash of intelligence, and that glow of joy, which marked \nthe delightful moment when Laura first perceived it.  I then placed \nall the articles on the table, and going away a little distance \nwith the children, placed Oliver\'s fingers in the positions to \nspell KEY, on which Laura went and brought the article:  the little \nfellow seemed much amused by this, and looked very attentive and \nsmiling.  I then caused him to make the letters BREAD, and in an \ninstant Laura went and brought him a piece:  he smelled at it; put \nit to his lips; cocked up his head with a most knowing look; seemed \nto reflect a moment; and then laughed outright, as much as to say, \n\"Aha!  I understand now how something may be made out of this.\"\n\n\'It was now clear that he had the capacity and inclination to \nlearn, that he was a proper subject for instruction, and needed \nonly persevering attention.  I therefore put him in the hands of an \nintelligent teacher, nothing doubting of his rapid progress.\'\n\nWell may this gentleman call that a delightful moment, in which \nsome distant promise of her present state first gleamed upon the \ndarkened mind of Laura Bridgman.  Throughout his life, the \nrecollection of that moment will be to him a source of pure, \nunfading happiness; nor will it shine less brightly on the evening \nof his days of Noble Usefulness.\n\nThe affection which exists between these two - the master and the \npupil - is as far removed from all ordinary care and regard, as the \ncircumstances in which it has had its growth, are apart from the \ncommon occurrences of life.  He is occupied now, in devising means \nof imparting to her, higher knowledge; and of conveying to her some \nadequate idea of the Great Creator of that universe in which, dark \nand silent and scentless though it be to her, she has such deep \ndelight and glad enjoyment.\n\nYe who have eyes and see not, and have ears and hear not; ye who \nare as the hypocrites of sad countenances, and disfigure your faces \nthat ye may seem unto men to fast; learn healthy cheerfulness, and \nmild contentment, from the deaf, and dumb, and blind!  Self-elected \nsaints with gloomy brows, this sightless, earless, voiceless child \nmay teach you lessons you will do well to follow.  Let that poor \nhand of hers lie gently on your hearts; for there may be something \nin its healing touch akin to that of the Great Master whose \nprecepts you misconstrue, whose lessons you pervert, of whose \ncharity and sympathy with all the world, not one among you in his \ndaily practice knows as much as many of the worst among those \nfallen sinners, to whom you are liberal in nothing but the \npreachment of perdition!\n\nAs I rose to quit the room, a pretty little child of one of the \nattendants came running in to greet its father.  For the moment, a \nchild with eyes, among the sightless crowd, impressed me almost as \npainfully as the blind boy in the porch had done, two hours ago.  \nAh! how much brighter and more deeply blue, glowing and rich though \nit had been before, was the scene without, contrasting with the \ndarkness of so many youthful lives within!\n\n* * * * * *\n\nAt SOUTH BOSTON, as it is called, in a situation excellently \nadapted for the purpose, several charitable institutions are \nclustered together.  One of these, is the State Hospital for the \ninsane; admirably conducted on those enlightened principles of \nconciliation and kindness, which twenty years ago would have been \nworse than heretical, and which have been acted upon with so much \nsuccess in our own pauper Asylum at Hanwell.  \'Evince a desire to \nshow some confidence, and repose some trust, even in mad people,\' \nsaid the resident physician, as we walked along the galleries, his \npatients flocking round us unrestrained.  Of those who deny or \ndoubt the wisdom of this maxim after witnessing its effects, if \nthere be such people still alive, I can only say that I hope I may \nnever be summoned as a Juryman on a Commission of Lunacy whereof \nthey are the subjects; for I should certainly find them out of \ntheir senses, on such evidence alone.\n\nEach ward in this institution is shaped like a long gallery or \nhall, with the dormitories of the patients opening from it on \neither hand.  Here they work, read, play at skittles, and other \ngames; and when the weather does not admit of their taking exercise \nout of doors, pass the day together.  In one of these rooms, \nseated, calmly, and quite as a matter of course, among a throng of \nmad-women, black and white, were the physician\'s wife and another \nlady, with a couple of children.  These ladies were graceful and \nhandsome; and it was not difficult to perceive at a glance that \neven their presence there, had a highly beneficial influence on the \npatients who were grouped about them.\n\nLeaning her head against the chimney-piece, with a great assumption \nof dignity and refinement of manner, sat an elderly female, in as \nmany scraps of finery as Madge Wildfire herself.  Her head in \nparticular was so strewn with scraps of gauze and cotton and bits \nof paper, and had so many queer odds and ends stuck all about it, \nthat it looked like a bird\'s-nest.  She was radiant with imaginary \njewels; wore a rich pair of undoubted gold spectacles; and \ngracefully dropped upon her lap, as we approached, a very old \ngreasy newspaper, in which I dare say she had been reading an \naccount of her own presentation at some Foreign Court.\n\nI have been thus particular in describing her, because she will \nserve to exemplify the physician\'s manner of acquiring and \nretaining the confidence of his patients.\n\n\'This,\' he said aloud, taking me by the hand, and advancing to the \nfantastic figure with great politeness - not raising her suspicions \nby the slightest look or whisper, or any kind of aside, to me:  \n\'This lady is the hostess of this mansion, sir.  It belongs to her.  \nNobody else has anything whatever to do with it.  It is a large \nestablishment, as you see, and requires a great number of \nattendants.  She lives, you observe, in the very first style.  She \nis kind enough to receive my visits, and to permit my wife and \nfamily to reside here; for which it is hardly necessary to say, we \nare much indebted to her.  She is exceedingly courteous, you \nperceive,\' on this hint she bowed condescendingly, \'and will permit \nme to have the pleasure of introducing you:  a gentleman from \nEngland, Ma\'am:  newly arrived from England, after a very \ntempestuous passage:  Mr. Dickens, - the lady of the house!\'\n\nWe exchanged the most dignified salutations with profound gravity \nand respect, and so went on.  The rest of the madwomen seemed to \nunderstand the joke perfectly (not only in this case, but in all \nthe others, except their own), and be highly amused by it.  The \nnature of their several kinds of insanity was made known to me in \nthe same way, and we left each of them in high good humour.  Not \nonly is a thorough confidence established, by those means, between \nthe physician and patient, in respect of the nature and extent of \ntheir hallucinations, but it is easy to understand that \nopportunities are afforded for seizing any moment of reason, to \nstartle them by placing their own delusion before them in its most \nincongruous and ridiculous light.\n\nEvery patient in this asylum sits down to dinner every day with a \nknife and fork; and in the midst of them sits the gentleman, whose \nmanner of dealing with his charges, I have just described.  At \nevery meal, moral influence alone restrains the more violent among \nthem from cutting the throats of the rest; but the effect of that \ninfluence is reduced to an absolute certainty, and is found, even \nas a means of restraint, to say nothing of it as a means of cure, a \nhundred times more efficacious than all the strait-waistcoats, \nfetters, and handcuffs, that ignorance, prejudice, and cruelty have \nmanufactured since the creation of the world.\n\nIn the labour department, every patient is as freely trusted with \nthe tools of his trade as if he were a sane man.  In the garden, \nand on the farm, they work with spades, rakes, and hoes.  For \namusement, they walk, run, fish, paint, read, and ride out to take \nthe air in carriages provided for the purpose.  They have among \nthemselves a sewing society to make clothes for the poor, which \nholds meetings, passes resolutions, never comes to fisty-cuffs or \nbowie-knives as sane assemblies have been known to do elsewhere; \nand conducts all its proceedings with the greatest decorum.  The \nirritability, which would otherwise be expended on their own flesh, \nclothes, and furniture, is dissipated in these pursuits.  They are \ncheerful, tranquil, and healthy.\n\nOnce a week they have a ball, in which the Doctor and his family, \nwith all the nurses and attendants, take an active part.  Dances \nand marches are performed alternately, to the enlivening strains of \na piano; and now and then some gentleman or lady (whose proficiency \nhas been previously ascertained) obliges the company with a song:  \nnor does it ever degenerate, at a tender crisis, into a screech or \nhowl; wherein, I must confess, I should have thought the danger \nlay.  At an early hour they all meet together for these festive \npurposes; at eight o\'clock refreshments are served; and at nine \nthey separate.\n\nImmense politeness and good breeding are observed throughout.  They \nall take their tone from the Doctor; and he moves a very \nChesterfield among the company.  Like other assemblies, these \nentertainments afford a fruitful topic of conversation among the \nladies for some days; and the gentlemen are so anxious to shine on \nthese occasions, that they have been sometimes found \'practising \ntheir steps\' in private, to cut a more distinguished figure in the \ndance.\n\nIt is obvious that one great feature of this system, is the \ninculcation and encouragement, even among such unhappy persons, of \na decent self-respect.  Something of the same spirit pervades all \nthe Institutions at South Boston.\n\nThere is the House of Industry.  In that branch of it, which is \ndevoted to the reception of old or otherwise helpless paupers, \nthese words are painted on the walls:  \'WORTHY OF NOTICE.  SELF-\nGOVERNMENT, QUIETUDE, AND PEACE, ARE BLESSINGS.\'  It is not assumed \nand taken for granted that being there they must be evil-disposed \nand wicked people, before whose vicious eyes it is necessary to \nflourish threats and harsh restraints.  They are met at the very \nthreshold with this mild appeal.  All within-doors is very plain \nand simple, as it ought to be, but arranged with a view to peace \nand comfort.  It costs no more than any other plan of arrangement, \nbut it speaks an amount of consideration for those who are reduced \nto seek a shelter there, which puts them at once upon their \ngratitude and good behaviour.  Instead of being parcelled out in \ngreat, long, rambling wards, where a certain amount of weazen life \nmay mope, and pine, and shiver, all day long, the building is \ndivided into separate rooms, each with its share of light and air.  \nIn these, the better kind of paupers live.  They have a motive for \nexertion and becoming pride, in the desire to make these little \nchambers comfortable and decent.\n\nI do not remember one but it was clean and neat, and had its plant \nor two upon the window-sill, or row of crockery upon the shelf, or \nsmall display of coloured prints upon the whitewashed wall, or, \nperhaps, its wooden clock behind the door.\n\nThe orphans and young children are in an adjoining building \nseparate from this, but a part of the same Institution.  Some are \nsuch little creatures, that the stairs are of Lilliputian \nmeasurement, fitted to their tiny strides.  The same consideration \nfor their years and weakness is expressed in their very seats, \nwhich are perfect curiosities, and look like articles of furniture \nfor a pauper doll\'s-house.  I can imagine the glee of our Poor Law \nCommissioners at the notion of these seats having arms and backs; \nbut small spines being of older date than their occupation of the \nBoard-room at Somerset House, I thought even this provision very \nmerciful and kind.\n\nHere again, I was greatly pleased with the inscriptions on the \nwall, which were scraps of plain morality, easily remembered and \nunderstood:  such as \'Love one another\' - \'God remembers the \nsmallest creature in his creation:\' and straightforward advice of \nthat nature.  The books and tasks of these smallest of scholars, \nwere adapted, in the same judicious manner, to their childish \npowers.  When we had examined these lessons, four morsels of girls \n(of whom one was blind) sang a little song, about the merry month \nof May, which I thought (being extremely dismal) would have suited \nan English November better.  That done, we went to see their \nsleeping-rooms on the floor above, in which the arrangements were \nno less excellent and gentle than those we had seen below.  And \nafter observing that the teachers were of a class and character \nwell suited to the spirit of the place, I took leave of the infants \nwith a lighter heart than ever I have taken leave of pauper infants \nyet.\n\nConnected with the House of Industry, there is also an Hospital, \nwhich was in the best order, and had, I am glad to say, many beds \nunoccupied.  It had one fault, however, which is common to all \nAmerican interiors:  the presence of the eternal, accursed, \nsuffocating, red-hot demon of a stove, whose breath would blight \nthe purest air under Heaven.\n\nThere are two establishments for boys in this same neighbourhood.  \nOne is called the Boylston school, and is an asylum for neglected \nand indigent boys who have committed no crime, but who in the \nordinary course of things would very soon be purged of that \ndistinction if they were not taken from the hungry streets and sent \nhere.  The other is a House of Reformation for Juvenile Offenders.  \nThey are both under the same roof, but the two classes of boys \nnever come in contact.\n\nThe Boylston boys, as may be readily supposed, have very much the \nadvantage of the others in point of personal appearance.  They were \nin their school-room when I came upon them, and answered correctly, \nwithout book, such questions as where was England; how far was it; \nwhat was its population; its capital city; its form of government; \nand so forth.  They sang a song too, about a farmer sowing his \nseed:  with corresponding action at such parts as \'\'tis thus he \nsows,\' \'he turns him round,\' \'he claps his hands;\' which gave it \ngreater interest for them, and accustomed them to act together, in \nan orderly manner.  They appeared exceedingly well-taught, and not \nbetter taught than fed; for a more chubby-looking full-waistcoated \nset of boys, I never saw.\n\nThe juvenile offenders had not such pleasant faces by a great deal, \nand in this establishment there were many boys of colour.  I saw \nthem first at their work (basket-making, and the manufacture of \npalm-leaf hats), afterwards in their school, where they sang a \nchorus in praise of Liberty:  an odd, and, one would think, rather \naggravating, theme for prisoners.  These boys are divided into four \nclasses, each denoted by a numeral, worn on a badge upon the arm.  \nOn the arrival of a new-comer, he is put into the fourth or lowest \nclass, and left, by good behaviour, to work his way up into the \nfirst.  The design and object of this Institution is to reclaim the \nyouthful criminal by firm but kind and judicious treatment; to make \nhis prison a place of purification and improvement, not of \ndemoralisation and corruption; to impress upon him that there is \nbut one path, and that one sober industry, which can ever lead him \nto happiness; to teach him how it may be trodden, if his footsteps \nhave never yet been led that way; and to lure him back to it if \nthey have strayed:  in a word, to snatch him from destruction, and \nrestore him to society a penitent and useful member.  The \nimportance of such an establishment, in every point of view, and \nwith reference to every consideration of humanity and social \npolicy, requires no comment.\n\nOne other establishment closes the catalogue.  It is the House of \nCorrection for the State, in which silence is strictly maintained, \nbut where the prisoners have the comfort and mental relief of \nseeing each other, and of working together.  This is the improved \nsystem of Prison Discipline which we have imported into England, \nand which has been in successful operation among us for some years \npast.\n\nAmerica, as a new and not over-populated country, has in all her \nprisons, the one great advantage, of being enabled to find useful \nand profitable work for the inmates; whereas, with us, the \nprejudice against prison labour is naturally very strong, and \nalmost insurmountable, when honest men who have not offended \nagainst the laws are frequently doomed to seek employment in vain.  \nEven in the United States, the principle of bringing convict labour \nand free labour into a competition which must obviously be to the \ndisadvantage of the latter, has already found many opponents, whose \nnumber is not likely to diminish with access of years.\n\nFor this very reason though, our best prisons would seem at the \nfirst glance to be better conducted than those of America.  The \ntreadmill is conducted with little or no noise; five hundred men \nmay pick oakum in the same room, without a sound; and both kinds of \nlabour admit of such keen and vigilant superintendence, as will \nrender even a word of personal communication amongst the prisoners \nalmost impossible.  On the other hand, the noise of the loom, the \nforge, the carpenter\'s hammer, or the stonemason\'s saw, greatly \nfavour those opportunities of intercourse - hurried and brief no \ndoubt, but opportunities still - which these several kinds of work, \nby rendering it necessary for men to be employed very near to each \nother, and often side by side, without any barrier or partition \nbetween them, in their very nature present.  A visitor, too, \nrequires to reason and reflect a little, before the sight of a \nnumber of men engaged in ordinary labour, such as he is accustomed \nto out of doors, will impress him half as strongly as the \ncontemplation of the same persons in the same place and garb would, \nif they were occupied in some task, marked and degraded everywhere \nas belonging only to felons in jails.  In an American state prison \nor house of correction, I found it difficult at first to persuade \nmyself that I was really in a jail:  a place of ignominious \npunishment and endurance.  And to this hour I very much question \nwhether the humane boast that it is not like one, has its root in \nthe true wisdom or philosophy of the matter.\n\nI hope I may not be misunderstood on this subject, for it is one in \nwhich I take a strong and deep interest.  I incline as little to \nthe sickly feeling which makes every canting lie or maudlin speech \nof a notorious criminal a subject of newspaper report and general \nsympathy, as I do to those good old customs of the good old times \nwhich made England, even so recently as in the reign of the Third \nKing George, in respect of her criminal code and her prison \nregulations, one of the most bloody-minded and barbarous countries \non the earth.  If I thought it would do any good to the rising \ngeneration, I would cheerfully give my consent to the disinterment \nof the bones of any genteel highwayman (the more genteel, the more \ncheerfully), and to their exposure, piecemeal, on any sign-post, \ngate, or gibbet, that might be deemed a good elevation for the \npurpose.  My reason is as well convinced that these gentry were as \nutterly worthless and debauched villains, as it is that the laws \nand jails hardened them in their evil courses, or that their \nwonderful escapes were effected by the prison-turnkeys who, in \nthose admirable days, had always been felons themselves, and were, \nto the last, their bosom-friends and pot-companions.  At the same \ntime I know, as all men do or should, that the subject of Prison \nDiscipline is one of the highest importance to any community; and \nthat in her sweeping reform and bright example to other countries \non this head, America has shown great wisdom, great benevolence, \nand exalted policy.  In contrasting her system with that which we \nhave modelled upon it, I merely seek to show that with all its \ndrawbacks, ours has some advantages of its own.\n\nThe House of Correction which has led to these remarks, is not \nwalled, like other prisons, but is palisaded round about with tall \nrough stakes, something after the manner of an enclosure for \nkeeping elephants in, as we see it represented in Eastern prints \nand pictures.  The prisoners wear a parti-coloured dress; and those \nwho are sentenced to hard labour, work at nail-making, or stone-\ncutting.  When I was there, the latter class of labourers were \nemployed upon the stone for a new custom-house in course of \nerection at Boston.  They appeared to shape it skilfully and with \nexpedition, though there were very few among them (if any) who had \nnot acquired the art within the prison gates.\n\nThe women, all in one large room, were employed in making light \nclothing, for New Orleans and the Southern States.  They did their \nwork in silence like the men; and like them were over-looked by the \nperson contracting for their labour, or by some agent of his \nappointment.  In addition to this, they are every moment liable to \nbe visited by the prison officers appointed for that purpose.\n\nThe arrangements for cooking, washing of clothes, and so forth, are \nmuch upon the plan of those I have seen at home.  Their mode of \nbestowing the prisoners at night (which is of general adoption) \ndiffers from ours, and is both simple and effective.  In the centre \nof a lofty area, lighted by windows in the four walls, are five \ntiers of cells, one above the other; each tier having before it a \nlight iron gallery, attainable by stairs of the same construction \nand material:  excepting the lower one, which is on the ground.  \nBehind these, back to back with them and facing the opposite wall, \nare five corresponding rows of cells, accessible by similar means:  \nso that supposing the prisoners locked up in their cells, an \nofficer stationed on the ground, with his back to the wall, has \nhalf their number under his eye at once; the remaining half being \nequally under the observation of another officer on the opposite \nside; and all in one great apartment.  Unless this watch be \ncorrupted or sleeping on his post, it is impossible for a man to \nescape; for even in the event of his forcing the iron door of his \ncell without noise (which is exceedingly improbable), the moment he \nappears outside, and steps into that one of the five galleries on \nwhich it is situated, he must be plainly and fully visible to the \nofficer below.  Each of these cells holds a small truckle bed, in \nwhich one prisoner sleeps; never more.  It is small, of course; and \nthe door being not solid, but grated, and without blind or curtain, \nthe prisoner within is at all times exposed to the observation and \ninspection of any guard who may pass along that tier at any hour or \nminute of the night.  Every day, the prisoners receive their \ndinner, singly, through a trap in the kitchen wall; and each man \ncarries his to his sleeping cell to eat it, where he is locked up, \nalone, for that purpose, one hour.  The whole of this arrangement \nstruck me as being admirable; and I hope that the next new prison \nwe erect in England may be built on this plan.\n\nI was given to understand that in this prison no swords or fire-\narms, or even cudgels, are kept; nor is it probable that, so long \nas its present excellent management continues, any weapon, \noffensive or defensive, will ever be required within its bounds.\n\nSuch are the Institutions at South Boston!  In all of them, the \nunfortunate or degenerate citizens of the State are carefully \ninstructed in their duties both to God and man; are surrounded by \nall reasonable means of comfort and happiness that their condition \nwill admit of; are appealed to, as members of the great human \nfamily, however afflicted, indigent, or fallen; are ruled by the \nstrong Heart, and not by the strong (though immeasurably weaker) \nHand.  I have described them at some length; firstly, because their \nworth demanded it; and secondly, because I mean to take them for a \nmodel, and to content myself with saying of others we may come to, \nwhose design and purpose are the same, that in this or that respect \nthey practically fail, or differ.\n\nI wish by this account of them, imperfect in its execution, but in \nits just intention, honest, I could hope to convey to my readers \none-hundredth part of the gratification, the sights I have \ndescribed, afforded me.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nTo an Englishman, accustomed to the paraphernalia of Westminster \nHall, an American Court of Law is as odd a sight as, I suppose, an \nEnglish Court of Law would be to an American.  Except in the \nSupreme Court at Washington (where the judges wear a plain black \nrobe), there is no such thing as a wig or gown connected with the \nadministration of justice.  The gentlemen of the bar being \nbarristers and attorneys too (for there is no division of those \nfunctions as in England) are no more removed from their clients \nthan attorneys in our Court for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors \nare, from theirs.  The jury are quite at home, and make themselves \nas comfortable as circumstances will permit.  The witness is so \nlittle elevated above, or put aloof from, the crowd in the court, \nthat a stranger entering during a pause in the proceedings would \nfind it difficult to pick him out from the rest.  And if it chanced \nto be a criminal trial, his eyes, in nine cases out of ten, would \nwander to the dock in search of the prisoner, in vain; for that \ngentleman would most likely be lounging among the most \ndistinguished ornaments of the legal profession, whispering \nsuggestions in his counsel\'s ear, or making a toothpick out of an \nold quill with his penknife.\n\nI could not but notice these differences, when I visited the courts \nat Boston.  I was much surprised at first, too, to observe that the \ncounsel who interrogated the witness under examination at the time, \ndid so SITTING.  But seeing that he was also occupied in writing \ndown the answers, and remembering that he was alone and had no \n\'junior,\' I quickly consoled myself with the reflection that law \nwas not quite so expensive an article here, as at home; and that \nthe absence of sundry formalities which we regard as indispensable, \nhad doubtless a very favourable influence upon the bill of costs.\n\nIn every Court, ample and commodious provision is made for the \naccommodation of the citizens.  This is the case all through \nAmerica.  In every Public Institution, the right of the people to \nattend, and to have an interest in the proceedings, is most fully \nand distinctly recognised.  There are no grim door-keepers to dole \nout their tardy civility by the sixpenny-worth; nor is there, I \nsincerely believe, any insolence of office of any kind.  Nothing \nnational is exhibited for money; and no public officer is a \nshowman.  We have begun of late years to imitate this good example.  \nI hope we shall continue to do so; and that in the fulness of time, \neven deans and chapters may be converted.\n\nIn the civil court an action was trying, for damages sustained in \nsome accident upon a railway.  The witnesses had been examined, and \ncounsel was addressing the jury.  The learned gentleman (like a few \nof his English brethren) was desperately long-winded, and had a \nremarkable capacity of saying the same thing over and over again.  \nHis great theme was \'Warren the ENGINE driver,\' whom he pressed \ninto the service of every sentence he uttered.  I listened to him \nfor about a quarter of an hour; and, coming out of court at the \nexpiration of that time, without the faintest ray of enlightenment \nas to the merits of the case, felt as if I were at home again.\n\nIn the prisoner\'s cell, waiting to be examined by the magistrate on \na charge of theft, was a boy.  This lad, instead of being committed \nto a common jail, would be sent to the asylum at South Boston, and \nthere taught a trade; and in the course of time he would be bound \napprentice to some respectable master.  Thus, his detection in this \noffence, instead of being the prelude to a life of infamy and a \nmiserable death, would lead, there was a reasonable hope, to his \nbeing reclaimed from vice, and becoming a worthy member of society.\n\nI am by no means a wholesale admirer of our legal solemnities, many \nof which impress me as being exceedingly ludicrous.  Strange as it \nmay seem too, there is undoubtedly a degree of protection in the \nwig and gown - a dismissal of individual responsibility in dressing \nfor the part - which encourages that insolent bearing and language, \nand that gross perversion of the office of a pleader for The Truth, \nso frequent in our courts of law.  Still, I cannot help doubting \nwhether America, in her desire to shake off the absurdities and \nabuses of the old system, may not have gone too far into the \nopposite extreme; and whether it is not desirable, especially in \nthe small community of a city like this, where each man knows the \nother, to surround the administration of justice with some \nartificial barriers against the \'Hail fellow, well met\' deportment \nof everyday life.  All the aid it can have in the very high \ncharacter and ability of the Bench, not only here but elsewhere, it \nhas, and well deserves to have; but it may need something more:  \nnot to impress the thoughtful and the well-informed, but the \nignorant and heedless; a class which includes some prisoners and \nmany witnesses.  These institutions were established, no doubt, \nupon the principle that those who had so large a share in making \nthe laws, would certainly respect them.  But experience has proved \nthis hope to be fallacious; for no men know better than the judges \nof America, that on the occasion of any great popular excitement \nthe law is powerless, and cannot, for the time, assert its own \nsupremacy.\n\nThe tone of society in Boston is one of perfect politeness, \ncourtesy, and good breeding.  The ladies are unquestionably very \nbeautiful - in face:  but there I am compelled to stop.  Their \neducation is much as with us; neither better nor worse.  I had \nheard some very marvellous stories in this respect; but not \nbelieving them, was not disappointed.  Blue ladies there are, in \nBoston; but like philosophers of that colour and sex in most other \nlatitudes, they rather desire to be thought superior than to be so.  \nEvangelical ladies there are, likewise, whose attachment to the \nforms of religion, and horror of theatrical entertainments, are \nmost exemplary.  Ladies who have a passion for attending lectures \nare to be found among all classes and all conditions.  In the kind \nof provincial life which prevails in cities such as this, the \nPulpit has great influence.  The peculiar province of the Pulpit in \nNew England (always excepting the Unitarian Ministry) would appear \nto be the denouncement of all innocent and rational amusements.  \nThe church, the chapel, and the lecture-room, are the only means of \nexcitement excepted; and to the church, the chapel, and the \nlecture-room, the ladies resort in crowds.\n\nWherever religion is resorted to, as a strong drink, and as an \nescape from the dull monotonous round of home, those of its \nministers who pepper the highest will be the surest to please.  \nThey who strew the Eternal Path with the greatest amount of \nbrimstone, and who most ruthlessly tread down the flowers and \nleaves that grow by the wayside, will be voted the most righteous; \nand they who enlarge with the greatest pertinacity on the \ndifficulty of getting into heaven, will be considered by all true \nbelievers certain of going there:  though it would be hard to say \nby what process of reasoning this conclusion is arrived at.  It is \nso at home, and it is so abroad.  With regard to the other means of \nexcitement, the Lecture, it has at least the merit of being always \nnew.  One lecture treads so quickly on the heels of another, that \nnone are remembered; and the course of this month may be safely \nrepeated next, with its charm of novelty unbroken, and its interest \nunabated.\n\nThe fruits of the earth have their growth in corruption.  Out of \nthe rottenness of these things, there has sprung up in Boston a \nsect of philosophers known as Transcendentalists.  On inquiring \nwhat this appellation might be supposed to signify, I was given to \nunderstand that whatever was unintelligible would be certainly \ntranscendental.  Not deriving much comfort from this elucidation, I \npursued the inquiry still further, and found that the \nTranscendentalists are followers of my friend Mr. Carlyle, or I \nshould rather say, of a follower of his, Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson.  \nThis gentleman has written a volume of Essays, in which, among much \nthat is dreamy and fanciful (if he will pardon me for saying so), \nthere is much more that is true and manly, honest and bold.  \nTranscendentalism has its occasional vagaries (what school has \nnot?), but it has good healthful qualities in spite of them; not \nleast among the number a hearty disgust of Cant, and an aptitude to \ndetect her in all the million varieties of her everlasting \nwardrobe.  And therefore if I were a Bostonian, I think I would be \na Transcendentalist.\n\nThe only preacher I heard in Boston was Mr. Taylor, who addresses \nhimself peculiarly to seamen, and who was once a mariner himself.  \nI found his chapel down among the shipping, in one of the narrow, \nold, water-side streets, with a gay blue flag waving freely from \nits roof.  In the gallery opposite to the pulpit were a little \nchoir of male and female singers, a violoncello, and a violin.  The \npreacher already sat in the pulpit, which was raised on pillars, \nand ornamented behind him with painted drapery of a lively and \nsomewhat theatrical appearance.  He looked a weather-beaten hard-\nfeatured man, of about six or eight and fifty; with deep lines \ngraven as it were into his face, dark hair, and a stern, keen eye.  \nYet the general character of his countenance was pleasant and \nagreeable.  The service commenced with a hymn, to which succeeded \nan extemporary prayer.  It had the fault of frequent repetition, \nincidental to all such prayers; but it was plain and comprehensive \nin its doctrines, and breathed a tone of general sympathy and \ncharity, which is not so commonly a characteristic of this form of \naddress to the Deity as it might be.  That done he opened his \ndiscourse, taking for his text a passage from the Song of Solomon, \nlaid upon the desk before the commencement of the service by some \nunknown member of the congregation:  \'Who is this coming up from \nthe wilderness, leaning on the arm of her beloved!\'\n\nHe handled his text in all kinds of ways, and twisted it into all \nmanner of shapes; but always ingeniously, and with a rude \neloquence, well adapted to the comprehension of his hearers.  \nIndeed if I be not mistaken, he studied their sympathies and \nunderstandings much more than the display of his own powers.  His \nimagery was all drawn from the sea, and from the incidents of a \nseaman\'s life; and was often remarkably good.  He spoke to them of \n\'that glorious man, Lord Nelson,\' and of Collingwood; and drew \nnothing in, as the saying is, by the head and shoulders, but \nbrought it to bear upon his purpose, naturally, and with a sharp \nmind to its effect.  Sometimes, when much excited with his subject, \nhe had an odd way - compounded of John Bunyan, and Balfour of \nBurley - of taking his great quarto Bible under his arm and pacing \nup and down the pulpit with it; looking steadily down, meantime, \ninto the midst of the congregation.  Thus, when he applied his text \nto the first assemblage of his hearers, and pictured the wonder of \nthe church at their presumption in forming a congregation among \nthemselves, he stopped short with his Bible under his arm in the \nmanner I have described, and pursued his discourse after this \nmanner:\n\n\'Who are these - who are they - who are these fellows? where do \nthey come from?  Where are they going to? - Come from!  What\'s the \nanswer?\' - leaning out of the pulpit, and pointing downward with \nhis right hand:  \'From below!\' - starting back again, and looking \nat the sailors before him:  \'From below, my brethren.  From under \nthe hatches of sin, battened down above you by the evil one.  \nThat\'s where you came from!\' - a walk up and down the pulpit:  \'and \nwhere are you going\' - stopping abruptly:  \'where are you going?  \nAloft!\' - very softly, and pointing upward:  \'Aloft!\' - louder:  \n\'aloft!\' - louder still:  \'That\'s where you are going - with a fair \nwind, - all taut and trim, steering direct for Heaven in its glory, \nwhere there are no storms or foul weather, and where the wicked \ncease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.\' - Another walk:  \n\'That\'s where you\'re going to, my friends.  That\'s it.  That\'s the \nplace.  That\'s the port.  That\'s the haven.  It\'s a blessed harbour \n- still water there, in all changes of the winds and tides; no \ndriving ashore upon the rocks, or slipping your cables and running \nout to sea, there:  Peace - Peace - Peace - all peace!\' - Another \nwalk, and patting the Bible under his left arm:  \'What!  These \nfellows are coming from the wilderness, are they?  Yes.  From the \ndreary, blighted wilderness of Iniquity, whose only crop is Death.  \nBut do they lean upon anything - do they lean upon nothing, these \npoor seamen?\' - Three raps upon the Bible:  \'Oh yes. - Yes. - They \nlean upon the arm of their Beloved\' - three more raps:  \'upon the \narm of their Beloved\' - three more, and a walk:  \'Pilot, guiding-\nstar, and compass, all in one, to all hands - here it is\' - three \nmore:  \'Here it is.  They can do their seaman\'s duty manfully, and \nbe easy in their minds in the utmost peril and danger, with this\' - \ntwo more:  \'They can come, even these poor fellows can come, from \nthe wilderness leaning on the arm of their Beloved, and go up - up \n- up!\' - raising his hand higher, and higher, at every repetition \nof the word, so that he stood with it at last stretched above his \nhead, regarding them in a strange, rapt manner, and pressing the \nbook triumphantly to his breast, until he gradually subsided into \nsome other portion of his discourse.\n\nI have cited this, rather as an instance of the preacher\'s \neccentricities than his merits, though taken in connection with his \nlook and manner, and the character of his audience, even this was \nstriking.  It is possible, however, that my favourable impression \nof him may have been greatly influenced and strengthened, firstly, \nby his impressing upon his hearers that the true observance of \nreligion was not inconsistent with a cheerful deportment and an \nexact discharge of the duties of their station, which, indeed, it \nscrupulously required of them; and secondly, by his cautioning them \nnot to set up any monopoly in Paradise and its mercies.  I never \nheard these two points so wisely touched (if indeed I have ever \nheard them touched at all), by any preacher of that kind before.\n\nHaving passed the time I spent in Boston, in making myself \nacquainted with these things, in settling the course I should take \nin my future travels, and in mixing constantly with its society, I \nam not aware that I have any occasion to prolong this chapter.  \nSuch of its social customs as I have not mentioned, however, may be \ntold in a very few words.\n\nThe usual dinner-hour is two o\'clock.  A dinner party takes place \nat five; and at an evening party, they seldom sup later than \neleven; so that it goes hard but one gets home, even from a rout, \nby midnight.  I never could find out any difference between a party \nat Boston and a party in London, saving that at the former place \nall assemblies are held at more rational hours; that the \nconversation may possibly be a little louder and more cheerful; and \na guest is usually expected to ascend to the very top of the house \nto take his cloak off; that he is certain to see, at every dinner, \nan unusual amount of poultry on the table; and at every supper, at \nleast two mighty bowls of hot stewed oysters, in any one of which a \nhalf-grown Duke of Clarence might be smothered easily.\n\nThere are two theatres in Boston, of good size and construction, \nbut sadly in want of patronage.  The few ladies who resort to them, \nsit, as of right, in the front rows of the boxes.\n\nThe bar is a large room with a stone floor, and there people stand \nand smoke, and lounge about, all the evening:  dropping in and out \nas the humour takes them.  There too the stranger is initiated into \nthe mysteries of Gin-sling, Cock-tail, Sangaree, Mint Julep, \nSherry-cobbler, Timber Doodle, and other rare drinks.  The house is \nfull of boarders, both married and single, many of whom sleep upon \nthe premises, and contract by the week for their board and lodging:  \nthe charge for which diminishes as they go nearer the sky to roost.  \nA public table is laid in a very handsome hall for breakfast, and \nfor dinner, and for supper.  The party sitting down together to \nthese meals will vary in number from one to two hundred:  sometimes \nmore.  The advent of each of these epochs in the day is proclaimed \nby an awful gong, which shakes the very window-frames as it \nreverberates through the house, and horribly disturbs nervous \nforeigners.  There is an ordinary for ladies, and an ordinary for \ngentlemen.\n\nIn our private room the cloth could not, for any earthly \nconsideration, have been laid for dinner without a huge glass dish \nof cranberries in the middle of the table; and breakfast would have \nbeen no breakfast unless the principal dish were a deformed beef-\nsteak with a great flat bone in the centre, swimming in hot butter, \nand sprinkled with the very blackest of all possible pepper.  Our \nbedroom was spacious and airy, but (like every bedroom on this side \nof the Atlantic) very bare of furniture, having no curtains to the \nFrench bedstead or to the window.  It had one unusual luxury, \nhowever, in the shape of a wardrobe of painted wood, something \nsmaller than an English watch-box; or if this comparison should be \ninsufficient to convey a just idea of its dimensions, they may be \nestimated from the fact of my having lived for fourteen days and \nnights in the firm belief that it was a shower-bath.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV - AN AMERICAN RAILROAD.  LOWELL AND ITS FACTORY SYSTEM\n\n\n\nBEFORE leaving Boston, I devoted one day to an excursion to Lowell.  \nI assign a separate chapter to this visit; not because I am about \nto describe it at any great length, but because I remember it as a \nthing by itself, and am desirous that my readers should do the \nsame.\n\nI made acquaintance with an American railroad, on this occasion, \nfor the first time.  As these works are pretty much alike all \nthrough the States, their general characteristics are easily \ndescribed.\n\nThere are no first and second class carriages as with us; but there \nis a gentleman\'s car and a ladies\' car:  the main distinction \nbetween which is that in the first, everybody smokes; and in the \nsecond, nobody does.  As a black man never travels with a white \none, there is also a negro car; which is a great, blundering, \nclumsy chest, such as Gulliver put to sea in, from the kingdom of \nBrobdingnag.  There is a great deal of jolting, a great deal of \nnoise, a great deal of wall, not much window, a locomotive engine, \na shriek, and a bell.\n\nThe cars are like shabby omnibuses, but larger:  holding thirty, \nforty, fifty, people.  The seats, instead of stretching from end to \nend, are placed crosswise.  Each seat holds two persons.  There is \na long row of them on each side of the caravan, a narrow passage up \nthe middle, and a door at both ends.  In the centre of the carriage \nthere is usually a stove, fed with charcoal or anthracite coal; \nwhich is for the most part red-hot.  It is insufferably close; and \nyou see the hot air fluttering between yourself and any other \nobject you may happen to look at, like the ghost of smoke.\n\nIn the ladies\' car, there are a great many gentlemen who have \nladies with them.  There are also a great many ladies who have \nnobody with them:  for any lady may travel alone, from one end of \nthe United States to the other, and be certain of the most \ncourteous and considerate treatment everywhere.  The conductor or \ncheck-taker, or guard, or whatever he may be, wears no uniform.  He \nwalks up and down the car, and in and out of it, as his fancy \ndictates; leans against the door with his hands in his pockets and \nstares at you, if you chance to be a stranger; or enters into \nconversation with the passengers about him.  A great many \nnewspapers are pulled out, and a few of them are read.  Everybody \ntalks to you, or to anybody else who hits his fancy.  If you are an \nEnglishman, he expects that that railroad is pretty much like an \nEnglish railroad.  If you say \'No,\' he says \'Yes?\' \n(interrogatively), and asks in what respect they differ.  You \nenumerate the heads of difference, one by one, and he says \'Yes?\' \n(still interrogatively) to each.  Then he guesses that you don\'t \ntravel faster in England; and on your replying that you do, says \n\'Yes?\' again (still interrogatively), and it is quite evident, \ndon\'t believe it.  After a long pause he remarks, partly to you, \nand partly to the knob on the top of his stick, that \'Yankees are \nreckoned to be considerable of a go-ahead people too;\' upon which \nYOU say \'Yes,\' and then HE says \'Yes\' again (affirmatively this \ntime); and upon your looking out of window, tells you that behind \nthat hill, and some three miles from the next station, there is a \nclever town in a smart lo-ca-tion, where he expects you have \nconcluded to stop.  Your answer in the negative naturally leads to \nmore questions in reference to your intended route (always \npronounced rout); and wherever you are going, you invariably learn \nthat you can\'t get there without immense difficulty and danger, and \nthat all the great sights are somewhere else.\n\nIf a lady take a fancy to any male passenger\'s seat, the gentleman \nwho accompanies her gives him notice of the fact, and he \nimmediately vacates it with great politeness.  Politics are much \ndiscussed, so are banks, so is cotton.  Quiet people avoid the \nquestion of the Presidency, for there will be a new election in \nthree years and a half, and party feeling runs very high:  the \ngreat constitutional feature of this institution being, that \ndirectly the acrimony of the last election is over, the acrimony of \nthe next one begins; which is an unspeakable comfort to all strong \npoliticians and true lovers of their country:  that is to say, to \nninety-nine men and boys out of every ninety-nine and a quarter.\n\nExcept when a branch road joins the main one, there is seldom more \nthan one track of rails; so that the road is very narrow, and the \nview, where there is a deep cutting, by no means extensive.  When \nthere is not, the character of the scenery is always the same.  \nMile after mile of stunted trees:  some hewn down by the axe, some \nblown down by the wind, some half fallen and resting on their \nneighbours, many mere logs half hidden in the swamp, others \nmouldered away to spongy chips.  The very soil of the earth is made \nup of minute fragments such as these; each pool of stagnant water \nhas its crust of vegetable rottenness; on every side there are the \nboughs, and trunks, and stumps of trees, in every possible stage of \ndecay, decomposition, and neglect.  Now you emerge for a few brief \nminutes on an open country, glittering with some bright lake or \npool, broad as many an English river, but so small here that it \nscarcely has a name; now catch hasty glimpses of a distant town, \nwith its clean white houses and their cool piazzas, its prim New \nEngland church and school-house; when whir-r-r-r! almost before you \nhave seen them, comes the same dark screen:  the stunted trees, the \nstumps, the logs, the stagnant water - all so like the last that \nyou seem to have been transported back again by magic.\n\nThe train calls at stations in the woods, where the wild \nimpossibility of anybody having the smallest reason to get out, is \nonly to be equalled by the apparently desperate hopelessness of \nthere being anybody to get in.  It rushes across the turnpike road, \nwhere there is no gate, no policeman, no signal:  nothing but a \nrough wooden arch, on which is painted \'WHEN THE BELL RINGS, LOOK \nOUT FOR THE LOCOMOTIVE.\'  On it whirls headlong, dives through the \nwoods again, emerges in the light, clatters over frail arches, \nrumbles upon the heavy ground, shoots beneath a wooden bridge which \nintercepts the light for a second like a wink, suddenly awakens all \nthe slumbering echoes in the main street of a large town, and \ndashes on haphazard, pell-mell, neck-or-nothing, down the middle of \nthe road.  There - with mechanics working at their trades, and \npeople leaning from their doors and windows, and boys flying kites \nand playing marbles, and men smoking, and women talking, and \nchildren crawling, and pigs burrowing, and unaccustomed horses \nplunging and rearing, close to the very rails - there - on, on, on \n- tears the mad dragon of an engine with its train of cars; \nscattering in all directions a shower of burning sparks from its \nwood fire; screeching, hissing, yelling, panting; until at last the \nthirsty monster stops beneath a covered way to drink, the people \ncluster round, and you have time to breathe again.\n\nI was met at the station at Lowell by a gentleman intimately \nconnected with the management of the factories there; and gladly \nputting myself under his guidance, drove off at once to that \nquarter of the town in which the works, the object of my visit, \nwere situated.  Although only just of age - for if my recollection \nserve me, it has been a manufacturing town barely one-and-twenty \nyears - Lowell is a large, populous, thriving place.  Those \nindications of its youth which first attract the eye, give it a \nquaintness and oddity of character which, to a visitor from the old \ncountry, is amusing enough.  It was a very dirty winter\'s day, and \nnothing in the whole town looked old to me, except the mud, which \nin some parts was almost knee-deep, and might have been deposited \nthere, on the subsiding of the waters after the Deluge.  In one \nplace, there was a new wooden church, which, having no steeple, and \nbeing yet unpainted, looked like an enormous packing-case without \nany direction upon it.  In another there was a large hotel, whose \nwalls and colonnades were so crisp, and thin, and slight, that it \nhad exactly the appearance of being built with cards.  I was \ncareful not to draw my breath as we passed, and trembled when I saw \na workman come out upon the roof, lest with one thoughtless stamp \nof his foot he should crush the structure beneath him, and bring it \nrattling down.  The very river that moves the machinery in the \nmills (for they are all worked by water power), seems to acquire a \nnew character from the fresh buildings of bright red brick and \npainted wood among which it takes its course; and to be as light-\nheaded, thoughtless, and brisk a young river, in its murmurings and \ntumblings, as one would desire to see.  One would swear that every \n\'Bakery,\' \'Grocery,\' and \'Bookbindery,\' and other kind of store, \ntook its shutters down for the first time, and started in business \nyesterday.  The golden pestles and mortars fixed as signs upon the \nsun-blind frames outside the Druggists\',  appear to have been just \nturned out of the United States\' Mint; and when I saw a baby of \nsome week or ten days old in a woman\'s arms at a street corner, I \nfound myself unconsciously wondering where it came from:  never \nsupposing for an instant that it could have been born in such a \nyoung town as that.\n\nThere are several factories in Lowell, each of which belongs to \nwhat we should term a Company of Proprietors, but what they call in \nAmerica a Corporation.  I went over several of these; such as a \nwoollen factory, a carpet factory, and a cotton factory:  examined \nthem in every part; and saw them in their ordinary working aspect, \nwith no preparation of any kind, or departure from their ordinary \neveryday proceedings.  I may add that I am well acquainted with our \nmanufacturing towns in England, and have visited many mills in \nManchester and elsewhere in the same manner.\n\nI happened to arrive at the first factory just as the dinner hour \nwas over, and the girls were returning to their work; indeed the \nstairs of the mill were thronged with them as I ascended.  They \nwere all well dressed, but not to my thinking above their \ncondition; for I like to see the humbler classes of society careful \nof their dress and appearance, and even, if they please, decorated \nwith such little trinkets as come within the compass of their \nmeans.  Supposing it confined within reasonable limits, I would \nalways encourage this kind of pride, as a worthy element of self-\nrespect, in any person I employed; and should no more be deterred \nfrom doing so, because some wretched female referred her fall to a \nlove of dress, than I would allow my construction of the real \nintent and meaning of the Sabbath to be influenced by any warning \nto the well-disposed, founded on his backslidings on that \nparticular day, which might emanate from the rather doubtful \nauthority of a murderer in Newgate.\n\nThese girls, as I have said, were all well dressed:  and that \nphrase necessarily includes extreme cleanliness.  They had \nserviceable bonnets, good warm cloaks, and shawls; and were not \nabove clogs and pattens.  Moreover, there were places in the mill \nin which they could deposit these things without injury; and there \nwere conveniences for washing.  They were healthy in appearance, \nmany of them remarkably so, and had the manners and deportment of \nyoung women:  not of degraded brutes of burden.  If I had seen in \none of those mills (but I did not, though I looked for something of \nthis kind with a sharp eye), the most lisping, mincing, affected, \nand ridiculous young creature that my imagination could suggest, I \nshould have thought of the careless, moping, slatternly, degraded, \ndull reverse (I HAVE seen that), and should have been still well \npleased to look upon her.\n\nThe rooms in which they worked, were as well ordered as themselves.  \nIn the windows of some, there were green plants, which were trained \nto shade the glass; in all, there was as much fresh air, \ncleanliness, and comfort, as the nature of the occupation would \npossibly admit of.  Out of so large a number of females, many of \nwhom were only then just verging upon womanhood, it may be \nreasonably supposed that some were delicate and fragile in \nappearance:  no doubt there were.  But I solemnly declare, that \nfrom all the crowd I saw in the different factories that day, I \ncannot recall or separate one young face that gave me a painful \nimpression; not one young girl whom, assuming it to be a matter of \nnecessity that she should gain her daily bread by the labour of her \nhands, I would have removed from those works if I had had the \npower.\n\nThey reside in various boarding-houses near at hand.  The owners of \nthe mills are particularly careful to allow no persons to enter \nupon the possession of these houses, whose characters have not \nundergone the most searching and thorough inquiry.  Any complaint \nthat is made against them, by the boarders, or by any one else, is \nfully investigated; and if good ground of complaint be shown to \nexist against them, they are removed, and their occupation is \nhanded over to some more deserving person.  There are a few \nchildren employed in these factories, but not many.  The laws of \nthe State forbid their working more than nine months in the year, \nand require that they be educated during the other three.  For this \npurpose there are schools in Lowell; and there are churches and \nchapels of various persuasions, in which the young women may \nobserve that form of worship in which they have been educated.\n\nAt some distance from the factories, and on the highest and \npleasantest ground in the neighbourhood, stands their hospital, or \nboarding-house for the sick:  it is the best house in those parts, \nand was built by an eminent merchant for his own residence.  Like \nthat institution at Boston, which I have before described, it is \nnot parcelled out into wards, but is divided into convenient \nchambers, each of which has all the comforts of a very comfortable \nhome.  The principal medical attendant resides under the same roof; \nand were the patients members of his own family, they could not be \nbetter cared for, or attended with greater gentleness and \nconsideration.  The weekly charge in this establishment for each \nfemale patient is three dollars, or twelve shillings English; but \nno girl employed by any of the corporations is ever excluded for \nwant of the means of payment.  That they do not very often want the \nmeans, may be gathered from the fact, that in July, 1841, no fewer \nthan nine hundred and seventy-eight of these girls were depositors \nin the Lowell Savings Bank:  the amount of whose joint savings was \nestimated at one hundred thousand dollars, or twenty thousand \nEnglish pounds.\n\nI am now going to state three facts, which will startle a large \nclass of readers on this side of the Atlantic, very much.\n\nFirstly, there is a joint-stock piano in a great many of the \nboarding-houses.  Secondly, nearly all these young ladies subscribe \nto circulating libraries.  Thirdly, they have got up among \nthemselves a periodical called THE LOWELL OFFERING, \'A repository \nof original articles, written exclusively by females actively \nemployed in the mills,\' - which is duly printed, published, and \nsold; and whereof I brought away from Lowell four hundred good \nsolid pages, which I have read from beginning to end.\n\nThe large class of readers, startled by these facts, will exclaim, \nwith one voice, \'How very preposterous!\'  On my deferentially \ninquiring why, they will answer, \'These things are above their \nstation.\'  In reply to that objection, I would beg to ask what \ntheir station is.\n\nIt is their station to work.  And they DO work.  They labour in \nthese mills, upon an average, twelve hours a day, which is \nunquestionably work, and pretty tight work too.  Perhaps it is \nabove their station to indulge in such amusements, on any terms.  \nAre we quite sure that we in England have not formed our ideas of \nthe \'station\' of working people, from accustoming ourselves to the \ncontemplation of that class as they are, and not as they might be?  \nI think that if we examine our own feelings, we shall find that the \npianos, and the circulating libraries, and even the Lowell \nOffering, startle us by their novelty, and not by their bearing \nupon any abstract question of right or wrong.\n\nFor myself, I know no station in which, the occupation of to-day \ncheerfully done and the occupation of to-morrow cheerfully looked \nto, any one of these pursuits is not most humanising and laudable.  \nI know no station which is rendered more endurable to the person in \nit, or more safe to the person out of it, by having ignorance for \nits associate.  I know no station which has a right to monopolise \nthe means of mutual instruction, improvement, and rational \nentertainment; or which has ever continued to be a station very \nlong, after seeking to do so.\n\nOf the merits of the Lowell Offering as a literary production, I \nwill only observe, putting entirely out of sight the fact of the \narticles having been written by these girls after the arduous \nlabours of the day, that it will compare advantageously with a \ngreat many English Annuals.  It is pleasant to find that many of \nits Tales are of the Mills and of those who work in them; that they \ninculcate habits of self-denial and contentment, and teach good \ndoctrines of enlarged benevolence.  A strong feeling for the \nbeauties of nature, as displayed in the solitudes the writers have \nleft at home, breathes through its pages like wholesome village \nair; and though a circulating library is a favourable school for \nthe study of such topics, it has very scant allusion to fine \nclothes, fine marriages, fine houses, or fine life.  Some persons \nmight object to the papers being signed occasionally with rather \nfine names, but this is an American fashion.  One of the provinces \nof the state legislature of Massachusetts is to alter ugly names \ninto pretty ones, as the children improve upon the tastes of their \nparents.  These changes costing little or nothing, scores of Mary \nAnnes are solemnly converted into Bevelinas every session.\n\nIt is said that on the occasion of a visit from General Jackson or \nGeneral Harrison to this town (I forget which, but it is not to the \npurpose), he walked through three miles and a half of these young \nladies all dressed out with parasols and silk stockings.  But as I \nam not aware that any worse consequence ensued, than a sudden \nlooking-up of all the parasols and silk stockings in the market; \nand perhaps the bankruptcy of some speculative New Englander who \nbought them all up at any price, in expectation of a demand that \nnever came; I set no great store by the circumstance.\n\nIn this brief account of Lowell, and inadequate expression of the \ngratification it yielded me, and cannot fail to afford to any \nforeigner to whom the condition of such people at home is a subject \nof interest and anxious speculation, I have carefully abstained \nfrom drawing a comparison between these factories and those of our \nown land.  Many of the circumstances whose strong influence has \nbeen at work for years in our manufacturing towns have not arisen \nhere; and there is no manufacturing population in Lowell, so to \nspeak:  for these girls (often the daughters of small farmers) come \nfrom other States, remain a few years in the mills, and then go \nhome for good.\n\nThe contrast would be a strong one, for it would be between the \nGood and Evil, the living light and deepest shadow.  I abstain from \nit, because I deem it just to do so.  But I only the more earnestly \nadjure all those whose eyes may rest on these pages, to pause and \nreflect upon the difference between this town and those great \nhaunts of desperate misery:  to call to mind, if they can in the \nmidst of party strife and squabble, the efforts that must be made \nto purge them of their suffering and danger:  and last, and \nforemost, to remember how the precious Time is rushing by.\n\nI returned at night by the same railroad and in the same kind of \ncar.  One of the passengers being exceedingly anxious to expound at \ngreat length to my companion (not to me, of course) the true \nprinciples on which books of travel in America should be written by \nEnglishmen, I feigned to fall asleep.  But glancing all the way out \nat window from the corners of my eyes, I found abundance of \nentertainment for the rest of the ride in watching the effects of \nthe wood fire, which had been invisible in the morning but were now \nbrought out in full relief by the darkness:  for we were travelling \nin a whirlwind of bright sparks, which showered about us like a \nstorm of fiery snow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V - WORCESTER.  THE CONNECTICUT RIVER.  HARTFORD.  NEW \nHAVEN.  TO NEW YORK\n\n\n\nLEAVING Boston on the afternoon of Saturday the fifth of February, \nwe proceeded by another railroad to Worcester:  a pretty New \nEngland town, where we had arranged to remain under the hospitable \nroof of the Governor of the State, until Monday morning.\n\nThese towns and cities of New England (many of which would be \nvillages in Old England), are as favourable specimens of rural \nAmerica, as their people are of rural Americans.  The well-trimmed \nlawns and green meadows of home are not there; and the grass, \ncompared with our ornamental plots and pastures, is rank, and \nrough, and wild:  but delicate slopes of land, gently-swelling \nhills, wooded valleys, and slender streams, abound.  Every little \ncolony of houses has its church and school-house peeping from among \nthe white roofs and shady trees; every house is the whitest of the \nwhite; every Venetian blind the greenest of the green; every fine \nday\'s sky the bluest of the blue.  A sharp dry wind and a slight \nfrost had so hardened the roads when we alighted at Worcester, that \ntheir furrowed tracks were like ridges of granite.  There was the \nusual aspect of newness on every object, of course.  All the \nbuildings looked as if they had been built and painted that \nmorning, and could be taken down on Monday with very little \ntrouble.  In the keen evening air, every sharp outline looked a \nhundred times sharper than ever.  The clean cardboard colonnades \nhad no more perspective than a Chinese bridge on a tea-cup, and \nappeared equally well calculated for use.  The razor-like edges of \nthe detached cottages seemed to cut the very wind as it whistled \nagainst them, and to send it smarting on its way with a shriller \ncry than before.  Those slightly-built wooden dwellings behind \nwhich the sun was setting with a brilliant lustre, could be so \nlooked through and through, that the idea of any inhabitant being \nable to hide himself from the public gaze, or to have any secrets \nfrom the public eye, was not entertainable for a moment.  Even \nwhere a blazing fire shone through the uncurtained windows of some \ndistant house, it had the air of being newly lighted, and of \nlacking warmth; and instead of awakening thoughts of a snug \nchamber, bright with faces that first saw the light round that same \nhearth, and ruddy with warm hangings, it came upon one suggestive \nof the smell of new mortar and damp walls.\n\nSo I thought, at least, that evening.  Next morning when the sun \nwas shining brightly, and the clear church bells were ringing, and \nsedate people in their best clothes enlivened the pathway near at \nhand and dotted the distant thread of road, there was a pleasant \nSabbath peacefulness on everything, which it was good to feel.  It \nwould have been the better for an old church; better still for some \nold graves; but as it was, a wholesome repose and tranquillity \npervaded the scene, which after the restless ocean and the hurried \ncity, had a doubly grateful influence on the spirits.\n\nWe went on next morning, still by railroad, to Springfield.  From \nthat place to Hartford, whither we were bound, is a distance of \nonly five-and-twenty miles, but at that time of the year the roads \nwere so bad that the journey would probably have occupied ten or \ntwelve hours.  Fortunately, however, the winter having been \nunusually mild, the Connecticut River was \'open,\' or, in other \nwords, not frozen.  The captain of a small steamboat was going to \nmake his first trip for the season that day (the second February \ntrip, I believe, within the memory of man), and only waited for us \nto go on board.  Accordingly, we went on board, with as little \ndelay as might be.  He was as good as his word, and started \ndirectly.\n\nIt certainly was not called a small steamboat without reason.  I \nomitted to ask the question, but I should think it must have been \nof about half a pony power.  Mr. Paap, the celebrated Dwarf, might \nhave lived and died happily in the cabin, which was fitted with \ncommon sash-windows like an ordinary dwelling-house.  These windows \nhad bright-red curtains, too, hung on slack strings across the \nlower panes; so that it looked like the parlour of a Lilliputian \npublic-house, which had got afloat in a flood or some other water \naccident, and was drifting nobody knew where.  But even in this \nchamber there was a rocking-chair.  It would be impossible to get \non anywhere, in America, without a rocking-chair.  I am afraid to \ntell how many feet short this vessel was, or how many feet narrow:  \nto apply the words length and width to such measurement would be a \ncontradiction in terms.  But I may state that we all kept the \nmiddle of the deck, lest the boat should unexpectedly tip over; and \nthat the machinery, by some surprising process of condensation, \nworked between it and the keel:  the whole forming a warm sandwich, \nabout three feet thick.\n\nIt rained all day as I once thought it never did rain anywhere, but \nin the Highlands of Scotland.  The river was full of floating \nblocks of ice, which were constantly crunching and cracking under \nus; and the depth of water, in the course we took to avoid the \nlarger masses, carried down the middle of the river by the current, \ndid not exceed a few inches.  Nevertheless, we moved onward, \ndexterously; and being well wrapped up, bade defiance to the \nweather, and enjoyed the journey.  The Connecticut River is a fine \nstream; and the banks in summer-time are, I have no doubt, \nbeautiful; at all events, I was told so by a young lady in the \ncabin; and she should be a judge of beauty, if the possession of a \nquality include the appreciation of it, for a more beautiful \ncreature I never looked upon.\n\nAfter two hours and a half of this odd travelling (including a \nstoppage at a small town, where we were saluted by a gun \nconsiderably bigger than our own chimney), we reached Hartford, and \nstraightway repaired to an extremely comfortable hotel:  except, as \nusual, in the article of bedrooms, which, in almost every place we \nvisited, were very conducive to early rising.\n\nWe tarried here, four days.  The town is beautifully situated in a \nbasin of green hills; the soil is rich, well-wooded, and carefully \nimproved.  It is the seat of the local legislature of Connecticut, \nwhich sage body enacted, in bygone times, the renowned code of \n\'Blue Laws,\' in virtue whereof, among other enlightened provisions, \nany citizen who could be proved to have kissed his wife on Sunday, \nwas punishable, I believe, with the stocks.  Too much of the old \nPuritan spirit exists in these parts to the present hour; but its \ninfluence has not tended, that I know, to make the people less hard \nin their bargains, or more equal in their dealings.  As I never \nheard of its working that effect anywhere else, I infer that it \nnever will, here.  Indeed, I am accustomed, with reference to great \nprofessions and severe faces, to judge of the goods of the other \nworld pretty much as I judge of the goods of this; and whenever I \nsee a dealer in such commodities with too great a display of them \nin his window, I doubt the quality of the article within.\n\nIn Hartford stands the famous oak in which the charter of King \nCharles was hidden.  It is now inclosed in a gentleman\'s garden.  \nIn the State House is the charter itself.  I found the courts of \nlaw here, just the same as at Boston; the public institutions \nalmost as good.  The Insane Asylum is admirably conducted, and so \nis the Institution for the Deaf and Dumb.\n\nI very much questioned within myself, as I walked through the \nInsane Asylum, whether I should have known the attendants from the \npatients, but for the few words which passed between the former, \nand the Doctor, in reference to the persons under their charge.  Of \ncourse I limit this remark merely to their looks; for the \nconversation of the mad people was mad enough.\n\nThere was one little, prim old lady, of very smiling and good-\nhumoured appearance, who came sidling up to me from the end of a \nlong passage, and with a curtsey of inexpressible condescension, \npropounded this unaccountable inquiry:\n\n\'Does Pontefract still flourish, sir, upon the soil of England?\'\n\n\'He does, ma\'am,\' I rejoined.\n\n\'When you last saw him, sir, he was - \'\n\n\'Well, ma\'am,\' said I, \'extremely well.  He begged me to present \nhis compliments.  I never saw him looking better.\'\n\nAt this, the old lady was very much delighted.  After glancing at \nme for a moment, as if to be quite sure that I was serious in my \nrespectful air, she sidled back some paces; sidled forward again; \nmade a sudden skip (at which I precipitately retreated a step or \ntwo); and said:\n\n\'I am an antediluvian, sir.\'\n\nI thought the best thing to say was, that I had suspected as much \nfrom the first.  Therefore I said so.\n\n\'It is an extremely proud and pleasant thing, sir, to be an \nantediluvian,\' said the old lady.\n\n\'I should think it was, ma\'am,\' I rejoined.\n\nThe old lady kissed her hand, gave another skip, smirked and sidled \ndown the gallery in a most extraordinary manner, and ambled \ngracefully into her own bed-chamber.\n\nIn another part of the building, there was a male patient in bed; \nvery much flushed and heated.\n\n\'Well,\' said he, starting up, and pulling off his night-cap:  \'It\'s \nall settled at last.  I have arranged it with Queen Victoria.\'\n\n\'Arranged what?\' asked the Doctor.\n\n\'Why, that business,\' passing his hand wearily across his forehead, \n\'about the siege of New York.\'\n\n\'Oh!\' said I, like a man suddenly enlightened.  For he looked at me \nfor an answer.\n\n\'Yes.  Every house without a signal will be fired upon by the \nBritish troops.  No harm will be done to the others.  No harm at \nall.  Those that want to be safe, must hoist flags.  That\'s all \nthey\'ll have to do.  They must hoist flags.\'\n\nEven while he was speaking he seemed, I thought, to have some faint \nidea that his talk was incoherent.  Directly he had said these \nwords, he lay down again; gave a kind of a groan; and covered his \nhot head with the blankets.\n\nThere was another:  a young man, whose madness was love and music.  \nAfter playing on the accordion a march he had composed, he was very \nanxious that I should walk into his chamber, which I immediately \ndid.\n\nBy way of being very knowing, and humouring him to the top of his \nbent, I went to the window, which commanded a beautiful prospect, \nand remarked, with an address upon which I greatly plumed myself:\n\n\'What a delicious country you have about these lodgings of yours!\'\n\n\'Poh!\' said he, moving his fingers carelessly over the notes of his \ninstrument:  \'WELL ENOUGH FOR SUCH AN INSTITUTION AS THIS!\'\n\nI don\'t think I was ever so taken aback in all my life.\n\n\'I come here just for a whim,\' he said coolly.  \'That\'s all.\'\n\n\'Oh!  That\'s all!\' said I.\n\n\'Yes.  That\'s all.  The Doctor\'s a smart man.  He quite enters into \nit.  It\'s a joke of mine.  I like it for a time.  You needn\'t \nmention it, but I think I shall go out next Tuesday!\'\n\nI assured him that I would consider our interview perfectly \nconfidential; and rejoined the Doctor.  As we were passing through \na gallery on our way out, a well-dressed lady, of quiet and \ncomposed manners, came up, and proffering a slip of paper and a \npen, begged that I would oblige her with an autograph, I complied, \nand we parted.\n\n\'I think I remember having had a few interviews like that, with \nladies out of doors.  I hope SHE is not mad?\'\n\n\'Yes.\'\n\n\'On what subject?  Autographs?\'\n\n\'No.  She hears voices in the air.\'\n\n\'Well!\' thought I, \'it would be well if we could shut up a few \nfalse prophets of these later times, who have professed to do the \nsame; and I should like to try the experiment on a Mormonist or two \nto begin with.\'\n\nIn this place, there is the best jail for untried offenders in the \nworld.  There is also a very well-ordered State prison, arranged \nupon the same plan as that at Boston, except that here, there is \nalways a sentry on the wall with a loaded gun.  It contained at \nthat time about two hundred prisoners.  A spot was shown me in the \nsleeping ward, where a watchman was murdered some years since in \nthe dead of night, in a desperate attempt to escape, made by a \nprisoner who had broken from his cell.  A woman, too, was pointed \nout to me, who, for the murder of her husband, had been a close \nprisoner for sixteen years.\n\n\'Do you think,\' I asked of my conductor, \'that after so very long \nan imprisonment, she has any thought or hope of ever regaining her \nliberty?\'\n\n\'Oh dear yes,\' he answered.  \'To be sure she has.\'\n\n\'She has no chance of obtaining it, I suppose?\'\n\n\'Well, I don\'t know:\' which, by-the-bye, is a national answer.  \n\'Her friends mistrust her.\'\n\n\'What have THEY to do with it?\' I naturally inquired.\n\n\'Well, they won\'t petition.\'\n\n\'But if they did, they couldn\'t get her out, I suppose?\'\n\n\'Well, not the first time, perhaps, nor yet the second, but tiring \nand wearying for a few years might do it.\'\n\n\'Does that ever do it?\'\n\n\'Why yes, that\'ll do it sometimes.  Political friends\'ll do it \nsometimes.  It\'s pretty often done, one way or another.\'\n\nI shall always entertain a very pleasant and grateful recollection \nof Hartford.  It is a lovely place, and I had many friends there, \nwhom I can never remember with indifference.  We left it with no \nlittle regret on the evening of Friday the 11th, and travelled that \nnight by railroad to New Haven.  Upon the way, the guard and I were \nformally introduced to each other (as we usually were on such \noccasions), and exchanged a variety of small-talk.  We reached New \nHaven at about eight o\'clock, after a journey of three hours, and \nput up for the night at the best inn.\n\nNew Haven, known also as the City of Elms, is a fine town.  Many of \nits streets (as its ALIAS sufficiently imports) are planted with \nrows of grand old elm-trees; and the same natural ornaments \nsurround Yale College, an establishment of considerable eminence \nand reputation.  The various departments of this Institution are \nerected in a kind of park or common in the middle of the town, \nwhere they are dimly visible among the shadowing trees.  The effect \nis very like that of an old cathedral yard in England; and when \ntheir branches are in full leaf, must be extremely picturesque.  \nEven in the winter time, these groups of well-grown trees, \nclustering among the busy streets and houses of a thriving city, \nhave a very quaint appearance:  seeming to bring about a kind of \ncompromise between town and country; as if each had met the other \nhalf-way, and shaken hands upon it; which is at once novel and \npleasant.\n\nAfter a night\'s rest, we rose early, and in good time went down to \nthe wharf, and on board the packet New York FOR New York.  This was \nthe first American steamboat of any size that I had seen; and \ncertainly to an English eye it was infinitely less like a steamboat \nthan a huge floating bath.  I could hardly persuade myself, indeed, \nbut that the bathing establishment off Westminster Bridge, which I \nleft a baby, had suddenly grown to an enormous size; run away from \nhome; and set up in foreign parts as a steamer.  Being in America, \ntoo, which our vagabonds do so particularly favour, it seemed the \nmore probable.\n\nThe great difference in appearance between these packets and ours, \nis, that there is so much of them out of the water:  the main-deck \nbeing enclosed on all sides, and filled with casks and goods, like \nany second or third floor in a stack of warehouses; and the \npromenade or hurricane-deck being a-top of that again.  A part of \nthe machinery is always above this deck; where the connecting-rod, \nin a strong and lofty frame, is seen working away like an iron top-\nsawyer.  There is seldom any mast or tackle:  nothing aloft but two \ntall black chimneys.  The man at the helm is shut up in a little \nhouse in the fore part of the boat (the wheel being connected with \nthe rudder by iron chains, working the whole length of the deck); \nand the passengers, unless the weather be very fine indeed, usually \ncongregate below.  Directly you have left the wharf, all the life, \nand stir, and bustle of a packet cease.  You wonder for a long time \nhow she goes on, for there seems to be nobody in charge of her; and \nwhen another of these dull machines comes splashing by, you feel \nquite indignant with it, as a sullen cumbrous, ungraceful, \nunshiplike leviathan:  quite forgetting that the vessel you are on \nboard of, is its very counterpart.\n\nThere is always a clerk\'s office on the lower deck, where you pay \nyour fare; a ladies\' cabin; baggage and stowage rooms; engineer\'s \nroom; and in short a great variety of perplexities which render the \ndiscovery of the gentlemen\'s cabin, a matter of some difficulty.  \nIt often occupies the whole length of the boat (as it did in this \ncase), and has three or four tiers of berths on each side.  When I \nfirst descended into the cabin of the New York, it looked, in my \nunaccustomed eyes, about as long as the Burlington Arcade.\n\nThe Sound which has to be crossed on this passage, is not always a \nvery safe or pleasant navigation, and has been the scene of some \nunfortunate accidents.  It was a wet morning, and very misty, and \nwe soon lost sight of land.  The day was calm, however, and \nbrightened towards noon.  After exhausting (with good help from a \nfriend) the larder, and the stock of bottled beer, I lay down to \nsleep; being very much tired with the fatigues of yesterday.  But I \nwoke from my nap in time to hurry up, and see Hell Gate, the Hog\'s \nBack, the Frying Pan, and other notorious localities, attractive to \nall readers of famous Diedrich Knickerbocker\'s History.  We were \nnow in a narrow channel, with sloping banks on either side, \nbesprinkled with pleasant villas, and made refreshing to the sight \nby turf and trees.  Soon we shot in quick succession, past a light-\nhouse; a madhouse (how the lunatics flung up their caps and roared \nin sympathy with the headlong engine and the driving tide!); a \njail; and other buildings:  and so emerged into a noble bay, whose \nwaters sparkled in the now cloudless sunshine like Nature\'s eyes \nturned up to Heaven.\n\nThen there lay stretched out before us, to the right, confused \nheaps of buildings, with here and there a spire or steeple, looking \ndown upon the herd below; and here and there, again, a cloud of \nlazy smoke; and in the foreground a forest of ships\' masts, cheery \nwith flapping sails and waving flags.  Crossing from among them to \nthe opposite shore, were steam ferry-boats laden with people, \ncoaches, horses, waggons, baskets, boxes:  crossed and recrossed by \nother ferry-boats:  all travelling to and fro:  and never idle.  \nStately among these restless Insects, were two or three large \nships, moving with slow majestic pace, as creatures of a prouder \nkind, disdainful of their puny journeys, and making for the broad \nsea.  Beyond, were shining heights, and islands in the glancing \nriver, and a distance scarcely less blue and bright than the sky it \nseemed to meet.  The city\'s hum and buzz, the clinking of capstans, \nthe ringing of bells, the barking of dogs, the clattering of \nwheels, tingled in the listening ear.  All of which life and stir, \ncoming across the stirring water, caught new life and animation \nfrom its free companionship; and, sympathising with its buoyant \nspirits, glistened as it seemed in sport upon its surface, and \nhemmed the vessel round, and plashed the water high about her \nsides, and, floating her gallantly into the dock, flew off again to \nwelcome other comers, and speed before them to the busy port.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI - NEW YORK\n\n\n\nTHE beautiful metropolis of America is by no means so clean a city \nas Boston, but many of its streets have the same characteristics; \nexcept that the houses are not quite so fresh-coloured, the sign-\nboards are not quite so gaudy, the gilded letters not quite so \ngolden, the bricks not quite so red, the stone not quite so white, \nthe blinds and area railings not quite so green, the knobs and \nplates upon the street doors not quite so bright and twinkling.  \nThere are many by-streets, almost as neutral in clean colours, and \npositive in dirty ones, as by-streets in London; and there is one \nquarter, commonly called the Five Points, which, in respect of \nfilth and wretchedness, may be safely backed against Seven Dials, \nor any other part of famed St. Giles\'s.\n\nThe great promenade and thoroughfare, as most people know, is \nBroadway; a wide and bustling street, which, from the Battery \nGardens to its opposite termination in a country road, may be four \nmiles long.  Shall we sit down in an upper floor of the Carlton \nHouse Hotel (situated in the best part of this main artery of New \nYork), and when we are tired of looking down upon the life below, \nsally forth arm-in-arm, and mingle with the stream?\n\nWarm weather!  The sun strikes upon our heads at this open window, \nas though its rays were concentrated through a burning-glass; but \nthe day is in its zenith, and the season an unusual one.  Was there \never such a sunny street as this Broadway!  The pavement stones are \npolished with the tread of feet until they shine again; the red \nbricks of the houses might be yet in the dry, hot kilns; and the \nroofs of those omnibuses look as though, if water were poured on \nthem, they would hiss and smoke, and smell like half-quenched \nfires.  No stint of omnibuses here!  Half-a-dozen have gone by \nwithin as many minutes.  Plenty of hackney cabs and coaches too; \ngigs, phaetons, large-wheeled tilburies, and private carriages - \nrather of a clumsy make, and not very different from the public \nvehicles, but built for the heavy roads beyond the city pavement.  \nNegro coachmen and white; in straw hats, black hats, white hats, \nglazed caps, fur caps; in coats of drab, black, brown, green, blue, \nnankeen, striped jean and linen; and there, in that one instance \n(look while it passes, or it will be too late), in suits of livery.  \nSome southern republican that, who puts his blacks in uniform, and \nswells with Sultan pomp and power.  Yonder, where that phaeton with \nthe well-clipped pair of grays has stopped - standing at their \nheads now - is a Yorkshire groom, who has not been very long in \nthese parts, and looks sorrowfully round for a companion pair of \ntop-boots, which he may traverse the city half a year without \nmeeting.  Heaven save the ladies, how they dress!  We have seen \nmore colours in these ten minutes, than we should have seen \nelsewhere, in as many days.  What various parasols! what rainbow \nsilks and satins! what pinking of thin stockings, and pinching of \nthin shoes, and fluttering of ribbons and silk tassels, and display \nof rich cloaks with gaudy hoods and linings!  The young gentlemen \nare fond, you see, of turning down their shirt-collars and \ncultivating their whiskers, especially under the chin; but they \ncannot approach the ladies in their dress or bearing, being, to say \nthe truth, humanity of quite another sort.  Byrons of the desk and \ncounter, pass on, and let us see what kind of men those are behind \nye:  those two labourers in holiday clothes, of whom one carries in \nhis hand a crumpled scrap of paper from which he tries to spell out \na hard name, while the other looks about for it on all the doors \nand windows.\n\nIrishmen both!  You might know them, if they were masked, by their \nlong-tailed blue coats and bright buttons, and their drab trousers, \nwhich they wear like men well used to working dresses, who are easy \nin no others.  It would be hard to keep your model republics going, \nwithout the countrymen and countrywomen of those two labourers.  \nFor who else would dig, and delve, and drudge, and do domestic \nwork, and make canals and roads, and execute great lines of \nInternal Improvement!  Irishmen both, and sorely puzzled too, to \nfind out what they seek.  Let us go down, and help them, for the \nlove of home, and that spirit of liberty which admits of honest \nservice to honest men, and honest work for honest bread, no matter \nwhat it be.\n\nThat\'s well!  We have got at the right address at last, though it \nis written in strange characters truly, and might have been \nscrawled with the blunt handle of the spade the writer better knows \nthe use of, than a pen.  Their way lies yonder, but what business \ntakes them there?  They carry savings:  to hoard up?  No.  They are \nbrothers, those men.  One crossed the sea alone, and working very \nhard for one half year, and living harder, saved funds enough to \nbring the other out.  That done, they worked together side by side, \ncontentedly sharing hard labour and hard living for another term, \nand then their sisters came, and then another brother, and lastly, \ntheir old mother.  And what now?  Why, the poor old crone is \nrestless in a strange land, and yearns to lay her bones, she says, \namong her people in the old graveyard at home:  and so they go to \npay her passage back:  and God help her and them, and every simple \nheart, and all who turn to the Jerusalem of their younger days, and \nhave an altar-fire upon the cold hearth of their fathers.\n\nThis narrow thoroughfare, baking and blistering in the sun, is Wall \nStreet:  the Stock Exchange and Lombard Street of New York.  Many a \nrapid fortune has been made in this street, and many a no less \nrapid ruin.  Some of these very merchants whom you see hanging \nabout here now, have locked up money in their strong-boxes, like \nthe man in the Arabian Nights, and opening them again, have found \nbut withered leaves.  Below, here by the water-side, where the \nbowsprits of ships stretch across the footway, and almost thrust \nthemselves into the windows, lie the noble American vessels which \nhaving made their Packet Service the finest in the world.  They \nhave brought hither the foreigners who abound in all the streets:  \nnot, perhaps, that there are more here, than in other commercial \ncities; but elsewhere, they have particular haunts, and you must \nfind them out; here, they pervade the town.\n\nWe must cross Broadway again; gaining some refreshment from the \nheat, in the sight of the great blocks of clean ice which are being \ncarried into shops and bar-rooms; and the pine-apples and water-\nmelons profusely displayed for sale.  Fine streets of spacious \nhouses here, you see! - Wall Street has furnished and dismantled \nmany of them very often - and here a deep green leafy square.  Be \nsure that is a hospitable house with inmates to be affectionately \nremembered always, where they have the open door and pretty show of \nplants within, and where the child with laughing eyes is peeping \nout of window at the little dog below.  You wonder what may be the \nuse of this tall flagstaff in the by-street, with something like \nLiberty\'s head-dress on its top:  so do I.  But there is a passion \nfor tall flagstaffs hereabout, and you may see its twin brother in \nfive minutes, if you have a mind.\n\nAgain across Broadway, and so - passing from the many-coloured \ncrowd and glittering shops - into another long main street, the \nBowery.  A railroad yonder, see, where two stout horses trot along, \ndrawing a score or two of people and a great wooden ark, with ease.  \nThe stores are poorer here; the passengers less gay.  Clothes \nready-made, and meat ready-cooked, are to be bought in these parts; \nand the lively whirl of carriages is exchanged for the deep rumble \nof carts and waggons.  These signs which are so plentiful, in shape \nlike river buoys, or small balloons, hoisted by cords to poles, and \ndangling there, announce, as you may see by looking up, \'OYSTERS IN \nEVERY STYLE.\'  They tempt the hungry most at night, for then dull \ncandles glimmering inside, illuminate these dainty words, and make \nthe mouths of idlers water, as they read and linger.\n\nWhat is this dismal-fronted pile of bastard Egyptian, like an \nenchanter\'s palace in a melodrama! - a famous prison, called The \nTombs.  Shall we go in?\n\nSo.  A long, narrow, lofty building, stove-heated as usual, with \nfour galleries, one above the other, going round it, and \ncommunicating by stairs.  Between the two sides of each gallery, \nand in its centre, a bridge, for the greater convenience of \ncrossing.  On each of these bridges sits a man:  dozing or reading, \nor talking to an idle companion.  On each tier, are two opposite \nrows of small iron doors.  They look like furnace-doors, but are \ncold and black, as though the fires within had all gone out.  Some \ntwo or three are open, and women, with drooping heads bent down, \nare talking to the inmates.  The whole is lighted by a skylight, \nbut it is fast closed; and from the roof there dangle, limp and \ndrooping, two useless windsails.\n\nA man with keys appears, to show us round.  A good-looking fellow, \nand, in his way, civil and obliging.\n\n\'Are those black doors the cells?\'\n\n\'Yes.\'\n\n\'Are they all full?\'\n\n\'Well, they\'re pretty nigh full, and that\'s a fact, and no two ways \nabout it.\'\n\n\'Those at the bottom are unwholesome, surely?\'\n\n\'Why, we DO only put coloured people in \'em.  That\'s the truth.\'\n\n\'When do the prisoners take exercise?\'\n\n\'Well, they do without it pretty much.\'\n\n\'Do they never walk in the yard?\'\n\n\'Considerable seldom.\'\n\n\'Sometimes, I suppose?\'\n\n\'Well, it\'s rare they do.  They keep pretty bright without it.\'\n\n\'But suppose a man were here for a twelvemonth.  I know this is \nonly a prison for criminals who are charged with grave offences, \nwhile they are awaiting their trial, or under remand, but the law \nhere affords criminals many means of delay.  What with motions for \nnew trials, and in arrest of judgment, and what not, a prisoner \nmight be here for twelve months, I take it, might he not?\'\n\n\'Well, I guess he might.\'\n\n\'Do you mean to say that in all that time he would never come out \nat that little iron door, for exercise?\'\n\n\'He might walk some, perhaps - not much.\'\n\n\'Will you open one of the doors?\'\n\n\'All, if you like.\'\n\nThe fastenings jar and rattle, and one of the doors turns slowly on \nits hinges.  Let us look in.  A small bare cell, into which the \nlight enters through a high chink in the wall.  There is a rude \nmeans of washing, a table, and a bedstead.  Upon the latter, sits a \nman of sixty; reading.  He looks up for a moment; gives an \nimpatient dogged shake; and fixes his eyes upon his book again.  As \nwe withdraw our heads, the door closes on him, and is fastened as \nbefore.  This man has murdered his wife, and will probably be \nhanged.\n\n\'How long has he been here?\'\n\n\'A month.\'\n\n\'When will he be tried?\'\n\n\'Next term.\'\n\n\'When is that?\'\n\n\'Next month.\'\n\n\'In England, if a man be under sentence of death, even he has air \nand exercise at certain periods of the day.\'\n\n\'Possible?\'\n\nWith what stupendous and untranslatable coolness he says this, and \nhow loungingly he leads on to the women\'s side:  making, as he \ngoes, a kind of iron castanet of the key and the stair-rail!\n\nEach cell door on this side has a square aperture in it.  Some of \nthe women peep anxiously through it at the sound of footsteps; \nothers shrink away in shame. - For what offence can that lonely \nchild, of ten or twelve years old, be shut up here?  Oh! that boy?  \nHe is the son of the prisoner we saw just now; is a witness against \nhis father; and is detained here for safe keeping, until the trial; \nthat\'s all.\n\nBut it is a dreadful place for the child to pass the long days and \nnights in.  This is rather hard treatment for a young witness, is \nit not? - What says our conductor?\n\n\'Well, it an\'t a very rowdy life, and THAT\'S a fact!\'\n\nAgain he clinks his metal castanet, and leads us leisurely away.  I \nhave a question to ask him as we go.\n\n\'Pray, why do they call this place The Tombs?\'\n\n\'Well, it\'s the cant name.\'\n\n\'I know it is.  Why?\'\n\n\'Some suicides happened here, when it was first built.  I expect it \ncome about from that.\'\n\n\'I saw just now, that that man\'s clothes were scattered about the \nfloor of his cell.  Don\'t you oblige the prisoners to be orderly, \nand put such things away?\'\n\n\'Where should they put \'em?\'\n\n\'Not on the ground surely.  What do you say to hanging them up?\'\n\nHe stops and looks round to emphasise his answer:\n\n\'Why, I say that\'s just it.  When they had hooks they WOULD hang \nthemselves, so they\'re taken out of every cell, and there\'s only \nthe marks left where they used to be!\'\n\nThe prison-yard in which he pauses now, has been the scene of \nterrible performances.  Into this narrow, grave-like place, men are \nbrought out to die.  The wretched creature stands beneath the \ngibbet on the ground; the rope about his neck; and when the sign is \ngiven, a weight at its other end comes running down, and swings him \nup into the air - a corpse.\n\nThe law requires that there be present at this dismal spectacle, \nthe judge, the jury, and citizens to the amount of twenty-five.  \nFrom the community it is hidden.  To the dissolute and bad, the \nthing remains a frightful mystery.  Between the criminal and them, \nthe prison-wall is interposed as a thick gloomy veil.  It is the \ncurtain to his bed of death, his winding-sheet, and grave.  From \nhim it shuts out life, and all the motives to unrepenting hardihood \nin that last hour, which its mere sight and presence is often all-\nsufficient to sustain.  There are no bold eyes to make him bold; no \nruffians to uphold a ruffian\'s name before.  All beyond the \npitiless stone wall, is unknown space.\n\nLet us go forth again into the cheerful streets.\n\nOnce more in Broadway!  Here are the same ladies in bright colours, \nwalking to and fro, in pairs and singly; yonder the very same light \nblue parasol which passed and repassed the hotel-window twenty \ntimes while we were sitting there.  We are going to cross here.  \nTake care of the pigs.  Two portly sows are trotting up behind this \ncarriage, and a select party of half-a-dozen gentlemen hogs have \njust now turned the corner.\n\nHere is a solitary swine lounging homeward by himself.  He has only \none ear; having parted with the other to vagrant-dogs in the course \nof his city rambles.  But he gets on very well without it; and \nleads a roving, gentlemanly, vagabond kind of life, somewhat \nanswering to that of our club-men at home.  He leaves his lodgings \nevery morning at a certain hour, throws himself upon the town, gets \nthrough his day in some manner quite satisfactory to himself, and \nregularly appears at the door of his own house again at night, like \nthe mysterious master of Gil Blas.  He is a free-and-easy, \ncareless, indifferent kind of pig, having a very large acquaintance \namong other pigs of the same character, whom he rather knows by \nsight than conversation, as he seldom troubles himself to stop and \nexchange civilities, but goes grunting down the kennel, turning up \nthe news and small-talk of the city in the shape of cabbage-stalks \nand offal, and bearing no tails but his own:  which is a very short \none, for his old enemies, the dogs, have been at that too, and have \nleft him hardly enough to swear by.  He is in every respect a \nrepublican pig, going wherever he pleases, and mingling with the \nbest society, on an equal, if not superior footing, for every one \nmakes way when he appears, and the haughtiest give him the wall, if \nhe prefer it.  He is a great philosopher, and seldom moved, unless \nby the dogs before mentioned.  Sometimes, indeed, you may see his \nsmall eye twinkling on a slaughtered friend, whose carcase \ngarnishes a butcher\'s door-post, but he grunts out \'Such is life:  \nall flesh is pork!\' buries his nose in the mire again, and waddles \ndown the gutter:  comforting himself with the reflection that there \nis one snout the less to anticipate stray cabbage-stalks, at any \nrate.\n\nThey are the city scavengers, these pigs.  Ugly brutes they are; \nhaving, for the most part, scanty brown backs, like the lids of old \nhorsehair trunks:  spotted with unwholesome black blotches.  They \nhave long, gaunt legs, too, and such peaked snouts, that if one of \nthem could be persuaded to sit for his profile, nobody would \nrecognise it for a pig\'s likeness.  They are never attended upon, \nor fed, or driven, or caught, but are thrown upon their own \nresources in early life, and become preternaturally knowing in \nconsequence.  Every pig knows where he lives, much better than \nanybody could tell him.  At this hour, just as evening is closing \nin, you will see them roaming towards bed by scores, eating their \nway to the last.  Occasionally, some youth among them who has over-\neaten himself, or has been worried by dogs, trots shrinkingly \nhomeward, like a prodigal son:  but this is a rare case:  perfect \nself-possession and self-reliance, and immovable composure, being \ntheir foremost attributes.\n\nThe streets and shops are lighted now; and as the eye travels down \nthe long thoroughfare, dotted with bright jets of gas, it is \nreminded of Oxford Street, or Piccadilly.  Here and there a flight \nof broad stone cellar-steps appears, and a painted lamp directs you \nto the Bowling Saloon, or Ten-Pin alley; Ten-Pins being a game of \nmingled chance and skill, invented when the legislature passed an \nact forbidding Nine-Pins.  At other downward flights of steps, are \nother lamps, marking the whereabouts of oyster-cellars - pleasant \nretreats, say I:  not only by reason of their wonderful cookery of \noysters, pretty nigh as large as cheese-plates (or for thy dear \nsake, heartiest of Greek Professors!), but because of all kinds of \ncaters of fish, or flesh, or fowl, in these latitudes, the \nswallowers of oysters alone are not gregarious; but subduing \nthemselves, as it were, to the nature of what they work in, and \ncopying the coyness of the thing they eat, do sit apart in \ncurtained boxes, and consort by twos, not by two hundreds.\n\nBut how quiet the streets are!  Are there no itinerant bands; no \nwind or stringed instruments?  No, not one.  By day, are there no \nPunches, Fantoccini, Dancing-dogs, Jugglers, Conjurers, \nOrchestrinas, or even Barrel-organs?  No, not one.  Yes, I remember \none.  One barrel-organ and a dancing-monkey - sportive by nature, \nbut fast fading into a dull, lumpish monkey, of the Utilitarian \nschool.  Beyond that, nothing lively; no, not so much as a white \nmouse in a twirling cage.\n\nAre there no amusements?  Yes.  There is a lecture-room across the \nway, from which that glare of light proceeds, and there may be \nevening service for the ladies thrice a week, or oftener.  For the \nyoung gentlemen, there is the counting-house, the store, the bar-\nroom:  the latter, as you may see through these windows, pretty \nfull.  Hark! to the clinking sound of hammers breaking lumps of \nice, and to the cool gurgling of the pounded bits, as, in the \nprocess of mixing, they are poured from glass to glass!  No \namusements?  What are these suckers of cigars and swallowers of \nstrong drinks, whose hats and legs we see in every possible variety \nof twist, doing, but amusing themselves?  What are the fifty \nnewspapers, which those precocious urchins are bawling down the \nstreet, and which are kept filed within, what are they but \namusements?  Not vapid, waterish amusements, but good strong stuff; \ndealing in round abuse and blackguard names; pulling off the roofs \nof private houses, as the Halting Devil did in Spain; pimping and \npandering for all degrees of vicious taste, and gorging with coined \nlies the most voracious maw; imputing to every man in public life \nthe coarsest and the vilest motives; scaring away from the stabbed \nand prostrate body-politic, every Samaritan of clear conscience and \ngood deeds; and setting on, with yell and whistle and the clapping \nof foul hands, the vilest vermin and worst birds of prey. - No \namusements!\n\nLet us go on again; and passing this wilderness of an hotel with \nstores about its base, like some Continental theatre, or the London \nOpera House shorn of its colonnade, plunge into the Five Points.  \nBut it is needful, first, that we take as our escort these two \nheads of the police, whom you would know for sharp and well-trained \nofficers if you met them in the Great Desert.  So true it is, that \ncertain pursuits, wherever carried on, will stamp men with the same \ncharacter.  These two might have been begotten, born, and bred, in \nBow Street.\n\nWe have seen no beggars in the streets by night or day; but of \nother kinds of strollers, plenty.  Poverty, wretchedness, and vice, \nare rife enough where we are going now.\n\nThis is the place:  these narrow ways, diverging to the right and \nleft, and reeking everywhere with dirt and filth.  Such lives as \nare led here, bear the same fruits here as elsewhere.  The coarse \nand bloated faces at the doors, have counterparts at home, and all \nthe wide world over.  Debauchery has made the very houses \nprematurely old.  See how the rotten beams are tumbling down, and \nhow the patched and broken windows seem to scowl dimly, like eyes \nthat have been hurt in drunken frays.  Many of those pigs live \nhere.  Do they ever wonder why their masters walk upright in lieu \nof going on all-fours? and why they talk instead of grunting?\n\nSo far, nearly every house is a low tavern; and on the bar-room \nwalls, are coloured prints of Washington, and Queen Victoria of \nEngland, and the American Eagle.  Among the pigeon-holes that hold \nthe bottles, are pieces of plate-glass and coloured paper, for \nthere is, in some sort, a taste for decoration, even here.  And as \nseamen frequent these haunts, there are maritime pictures by the \ndozen:  of partings between sailors and their lady-loves, portraits \nof William, of the ballad, and his Black-Eyed Susan; of Will Watch, \nthe Bold Smuggler; of Paul Jones the Pirate, and the like:  on \nwhich the painted eyes of Queen Victoria, and of Washington to \nboot, rest in as strange companionship, as on most of the scenes \nthat are enacted in their wondering presence.\n\nWhat place is this, to which the squalid street conducts us?  A \nkind of square of leprous houses, some of which are attainable only \nby crazy wooden stairs without.  What lies beyond this tottering \nflight of steps, that creak beneath our tread? - a miserable room, \nlighted by one dim candle, and destitute of all comfort, save that \nwhich may be hidden in a wretched bed.  Beside it, sits a man:  his \nelbows on his knees:  his forehead hidden in his hands.  \'What ails \nthat man?\' asks the foremost officer.  \'Fever,\' he sullenly \nreplies, without looking up.  Conceive the fancies of a feverish \nbrain, in such a place as this!\n\nAscend these pitch-dark stairs, heedful of a false footing on the \ntrembling boards, and grope your way with me into this wolfish den, \nwhere neither ray of light nor breath of air, appears to come.  A \nnegro lad, startled from his sleep by the officer\'s voice - he \nknows it well - but comforted by his assurance that he has not come \non business, officiously bestirs himself to light a candle.  The \nmatch flickers for a moment, and shows great mounds of dusty rags \nupon the ground; then dies away and leaves a denser darkness than \nbefore, if there can be degrees in such extremes.  He stumbles down \nthe stairs and presently comes back, shading a flaring taper with \nhis hand.  Then the mounds of rags are seen to be astir, and rise \nslowly up, and the floor is covered with heaps of negro women, \nwaking from their sleep:  their white teeth chattering, and their \nbright eyes glistening and winking on all sides with surprise and \nfear, like the countless repetition of one astonished African face \nin some strange mirror.\n\nMount up these other stairs with no less caution (there are traps \nand pitfalls here, for those who are not so well escorted as \nourselves) into the housetop; where the bare beams and rafters meet \noverhead, and calm night looks down through the crevices in the \nroof.  Open the door of one of these cramped hutches full of \nsleeping negroes.  Pah!  They have a charcoal fire within; there is \na smell of singeing clothes, or flesh, so close they gather round \nthe brazier; and vapours issue forth that blind and suffocate.  \nFrom every corner, as you glance about you in these dark retreats, \nsome figure crawls half-awakened, as if the judgment-hour were near \nat hand, and every obscene grave were giving up its dead.  Where \ndogs would howl to lie, women, and men, and boys slink off to \nsleep, forcing the dislodged rats to move away in quest of better \nlodgings.\n\nHere too are lanes and alleys, paved with mud knee-deep, \nunderground chambers, where they dance and game; the walls bedecked \nwith rough designs of ships, and forts, and flags, and American \neagles out of number:  ruined houses, open to the street, whence, \nthrough wide gaps in the walls, other ruins loom upon the eye, as \nthough the world of vice and misery had nothing else to show:  \nhideous tenements which take their name from robbery and murder:  \nall that is loathsome, drooping, and decayed is here.\n\nOur leader has his hand upon the latch of \'Almack\'s,\' and calls to \nus from the bottom of the steps; for the assembly-room of the Five \nPoint fashionables is approached by a descent.  Shall we go in?  It \nis but a moment.\n\nHeyday! the landlady of Almack\'s thrives!  A buxom fat mulatto \nwoman, with sparkling eyes, whose head is daintily ornamented with \na handkerchief of many colours.  Nor is the landlord much behind \nher in his finery, being attired in a smart blue jacket, like a \nship\'s steward, with a thick gold ring upon his little finger, and \nround his neck a gleaming golden watch-guard.  How glad he is to \nsee us!  What will we please to call for?  A dance?  It shall be \ndone directly, sir:  \'a regular break-down.\'\n\nThe corpulent black fiddler, and his friend who plays the \ntambourine, stamp upon the boarding of the small raised orchestra \nin which they sit, and play a lively measure.  Five or six couple \ncome upon the floor, marshalled by a lively young negro, who is the \nwit of the assembly, and the greatest dancer known.  He never \nleaves off making queer faces, and is the delight of all the rest, \nwho grin from ear to ear incessantly.  Among the dancers are two \nyoung mulatto girls, with large, black, drooping eyes, and head-\ngear after the fashion of the hostess, who are as shy, or feign to \nbe, as though they never danced before, and so look down before the \nvisitors, that their partners can see nothing but the long fringed \nlashes.\n\nBut the dance commences.  Every gentleman sets as long as he likes \nto the opposite lady, and the opposite lady to him, and all are so \nlong about it that the sport begins to languish, when suddenly the \nlively hero dashes in to the rescue.  Instantly the fiddler grins, \nand goes at it tooth and nail; there is new energy in the \ntambourine; new laughter in the dancers; new smiles in the \nlandlady; new confidence in the landlord; new brightness in the \nvery candles.\n\nSingle shuffle, double shuffle, cut and cross-cut; snapping his \nfingers, rolling his eyes, turning in his knees, presenting the \nbacks of his legs in front, spinning about on his toes and heels \nlike nothing but the man\'s fingers on the tambourine; dancing with \ntwo left legs, two right legs, two wooden legs, two wire legs, two \nspring legs - all sorts of legs and no legs - what is this to him?  \nAnd in what walk of life, or dance of life, does man ever get such \nstimulating applause as thunders about him, when, having danced his \npartner off her feet, and himself too, he finishes by leaping \ngloriously on the bar-counter, and calling for something to drink, \nwith the chuckle of a million of counterfeit Jim Crows, in one \ninimitable sound!\n\nThe air, even in these distempered parts, is fresh after the \nstifling atmosphere of the houses; and now, as we emerge into a \nbroader street, it blows upon us with a purer breath, and the stars \nlook bright again.  Here are The Tombs once more.  The city watch-\nhouse is a part of the building.  It follows naturally on the \nsights we have just left.  Let us see that, and then to bed.\n\nWhat! do you thrust your common offenders against the police \ndiscipline of the town, into such holes as these?  Do men and \nwomen, against whom no crime is proved, lie here all night in \nperfect darkness, surrounded by the noisome vapours which encircle \nthat flagging lamp you light us with, and breathing this filthy and \noffensive stench!  Why, such indecent and disgusting dungeons as \nthese cells, would bring disgrace upon the most despotic empire in \nthe world!  Look at them, man - you, who see them every night, and \nkeep the keys.  Do you see what they are?  Do you know how drains \nare made below the streets, and wherein these human sewers differ, \nexcept in being always stagnant?\n\nWell, he don\'t know.  He has had five-and-twenty young women locked \nup in this very cell at one time, and you\'d hardly realise what \nhandsome faces there were among \'em.\n\nIn God\'s name! shut the door upon the wretched creature who is in \nit now, and put its screen before a place, quite unsurpassed in all \nthe vice, neglect, and devilry, of the worst old town in Europe.\n\nAre people really left all night, untried, in those black sties? - \nEvery night.  The watch is set at seven in the evening.  The \nmagistrate opens his court at five in the morning.  That is the \nearliest hour at which the first prisoner can be released; and if \nan officer appear against him, he is not taken out till nine \no\'clock or ten. - But if any one among them die in the interval, as \none man did, not long ago?  Then he is half-eaten by the rats in an \nhour\'s time; as that man was; and there an end.\n\nWhat is this intolerable tolling of great bells, and crashing of \nwheels, and shouting in the distance?  A fire.  And what that deep \nred light in the opposite direction?  Another fire.  And what these \ncharred and blackened walls we stand before?  A dwelling where a \nfire has been.  It was more than hinted, in an official report, not \nlong ago, that some of these conflagrations were not wholly \naccidental, and that speculation and enterprise found a field of \nexertion, even in flames:  but be this as it may, there was a fire \nlast night, there are two to-night, and you may lay an even wager \nthere will be at least one, to-morrow.  So, carrying that with us \nfor our comfort, let us say, Good night, and climb up-stairs to \nbed.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nOne day, during my stay in New York, I paid a visit to the \ndifferent public institutions on Long Island, or Rhode Island:  I \nforget which.  One of them is a Lunatic Asylum.  The building is \nhandsome; and is remarkable for a spacious and elegant staircase.  \nThe whole structure is not yet finished, but it is already one of \nconsiderable size and extent, and is capable of accommodating a \nvery large number of patients.\n\nI cannot say that I derived much comfort from the inspection of \nthis charity.  The different wards might have been cleaner and \nbetter ordered; I saw nothing of that salutary system which had \nimpressed me so favourably elsewhere; and everything had a \nlounging, listless, madhouse air, which was very painful.  The \nmoping idiot, cowering down with long dishevelled hair; the \ngibbering maniac, with his hideous laugh and pointed finger; the \nvacant eye, the fierce wild face, the gloomy picking of the hands \nand lips, and munching of the nails:  there they were all, without \ndisguise, in naked ugliness and horror.  In the dining-room, a \nbare, dull, dreary place, with nothing for the eye to rest on but \nthe empty walls, a woman was locked up alone.  She was bent, they \ntold me, on committing suicide.  If anything could have \nstrengthened her in her resolution, it would certainly have been \nthe insupportable monotony of such an existence.\n\nThe terrible crowd with which these halls and galleries were \nfilled, so shocked me, that I abridged my stay within the shortest \nlimits, and declined to see that portion of the building in which \nthe refractory and violent were under closer restraint.  I have no \ndoubt that the gentleman who presided over this establishment at \nthe time I write of, was competent to manage it, and had done all \nin his power to promote its usefulness:  but will it be believed \nthat the miserable strife of Party feeling is carried even into \nthis sad refuge of afflicted and degraded humanity?  Will it be \nbelieved that the eyes which are to watch over and control the \nwanderings of minds on which the most dreadful visitation to which \nour nature is exposed has fallen, must wear the glasses of some \nwretched side in Politics?  Will it be believed that the governor \nof such a house as this, is appointed, and deposed, and changed \nperpetually, as Parties fluctuate and vary, and as their despicable \nweathercocks are blown this way or that?  A hundred times in every \nweek, some new most paltry exhibition of that narrow-minded and \ninjurious Party Spirit, which is the Simoom of America, sickening \nand blighting everything of wholesome life within its reach, was \nforced upon my notice; but I never turned my back upon it with \nfeelings of such deep disgust and measureless contempt, as when I \ncrossed the threshold of this madhouse.\n\nAt a short distance from this building is another called the Alms \nHouse, that is to say, the workhouse of New York.  This is a large \nInstitution also:  lodging, I believe, when I was there, nearly a \nthousand poor.  It was badly ventilated, and badly lighted; was not \ntoo clean; - and impressed me, on the whole, very uncomfortably.  \nBut it must be remembered that New York, as a great emporium of \ncommerce, and as a place of general resort, not only from all parts \nof the States, but from most parts of the world, has always a large \npauper population to provide for; and labours, therefore, under \npeculiar difficulties in this respect.  Nor must it be forgotten \nthat New York is a large town, and that in all large towns a vast \namount of good and evil is intermixed and jumbled up together.\n\nIn the same neighbourhood is the Farm, where young orphans are \nnursed and bred.  I did not see it, but I believe it is well \nconducted; and I can the more easily credit it, from knowing how \nmindful they usually are, in America, of that beautiful passage in \nthe Litany which remembers all sick persons and young children.\n\nI was taken to these Institutions by water, in a boat belonging to \nthe Island jail, and rowed by a crew of prisoners, who were dressed \nin a striped uniform of black and buff, in which they looked like \nfaded tigers.  They took me, by the same conveyance, to the jail \nitself.\n\nIt is an old prison, and quite a pioneer establishment, on the plan \nI have already described.  I was glad to hear this, for it is \nunquestionably a very indifferent one.  The most is made, however, \nof the means it possesses, and it is as well regulated as such a \nplace can be.\n\nThe women work in covered sheds, erected for that purpose.  If I \nremember right, there are no shops for the men, but be that as it \nmay, the greater part of them labour in certain stone-quarries near \nat hand.  The day being very wet indeed, this labour was suspended, \nand the prisoners were in their cells.  Imagine these cells, some \ntwo or three hundred in number, and in every one a man locked up; \nthis one at his door for air, with his hands thrust through the \ngrate; this one in bed (in the middle of the day, remember); and \nthis one flung down in a heap upon the ground, with his head \nagainst the bars, like a wild beast.  Make the rain pour down, \noutside, in torrents.  Put the everlasting stove in the midst; hot, \nand suffocating, and vaporous, as a witch\'s cauldron.  Add a \ncollection of gentle odours, such as would arise from a thousand \nmildewed umbrellas, wet through, and a thousand buck-baskets, full \nof half-washed linen - and there is the prison, as it was that day.\n\nThe prison for the State at Sing Sing is, on the other hand, a \nmodel jail.  That, and Auburn, are, I believe, the largest and best \nexamples of the silent system.\n\nIn another part of the city, is the Refuge for the Destitute:  an \nInstitution whose object is to reclaim youthful offenders, male and \nfemale, black and white, without distinction; to teach them useful \ntrades, apprentice them to respectable masters, and make them \nworthy members of society.  Its design, it will be seen, is similar \nto that at Boston; and it is a no less meritorious and admirable \nestablishment.  A suspicion crossed my mind during my inspection of \nthis noble charity, whether the superintendent had quite sufficient \nknowledge of the world and worldly characters; and whether he did \nnot commit a great mistake in treating some young girls, who were \nto all intents and purposes, by their years and their past lives, \nwomen, as though they were little children; which certainly had a \nludicrous effect in my eyes, and, or I am much mistaken, in theirs \nalso.  As the Institution, however, is always under a vigilant \nexamination of a body of gentlemen of great intelligence and \nexperience, it cannot fail to be well conducted; and whether I am \nright or wrong in this slight particular, is unimportant to its \ndeserts and character, which it would be difficult to estimate too \nhighly.\n\nIn addition to these establishments, there are in New York, \nexcellent hospitals and schools, literary institutions and \nlibraries; an admirable fire department (as indeed it should be, \nhaving constant practice), and charities of every sort and kind.  \nIn the suburbs there is a spacious cemetery:  unfinished yet, but \nevery day improving.  The saddest tomb I saw there was \'The \nStrangers\' Grave.  Dedicated to the different hotels in this city.\'\n\nThere are three principal theatres.  Two of them, the Park and the \nBowery, are large, elegant, and handsome buildings, and are, I \ngrieve to write it, generally deserted.  The third, the Olympic, is \na tiny show-box for vaudevilles and burlesques.  It is singularly \nwell conducted by Mr. Mitchell, a comic actor of great quiet humour \nand originality, who is well remembered and esteemed by London \nplaygoers.  I am happy to report of this deserving gentleman, that \nhis benches are usually well filled, and that his theatre rings \nwith merriment every night.  I had almost forgotten a small summer \ntheatre, called Niblo\'s, with gardens and open air amusements \nattached; but I believe it is not exempt from the general \ndepression under which Theatrical Property, or what is humorously \ncalled by that name, unfortunately labours.\n\nThe country round New York is surpassingly and exquisitely \npicturesque.  The climate, as I have already intimated, is somewhat \nof the warmest.  What it would be, without the sea breezes which \ncome from its beautiful Bay in the evening time, I will not throw \nmyself or my readers into a fever by inquiring.\n\nThe tone of the best society in this city, is like that of Boston; \nhere and there, it may be, with a greater infusion of the \nmercantile spirit, but generally polished and refined, and always \nmost hospitable.  The houses and tables are elegant; the hours \nlater and more rakish; and there is, perhaps, a greater spirit of \ncontention in reference to appearances, and the display of wealth \nand costly living.  The ladies are singularly beautiful.\n\nBefore I left New York I made arrangements for securing a passage \nhome in the George Washington packet ship, which was advertised to \nsail in June:  that being the month in which I had determined, if \nprevented by no accident in the course of my ramblings, to leave \nAmerica.\n\nI never thought that going back to England, returning to all who \nare dear to me, and to pursuits that have insensibly grown to be a \npart of my nature, I could have felt so much sorrow as I endured, \nwhen I parted at last, on board this ship, with the friends who had \naccompanied me from this city.  I never thought the name of any \nplace, so far away and so lately known, could ever associate itself \nin my mind with the crowd of affectionate remembrances that now \ncluster about it.  There are those in this city who would brighten, \nto me, the darkest winter-day that ever glimmered and went out in \nLapland; and before whose presence even Home grew dim, when they \nand I exchanged that painful word which mingles with our every \nthought and deed; which haunts our cradle-heads in infancy, and \ncloses up the vista of our lives in age.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII - PHILADELPHIA, AND ITS SOLITARY PRISON\n\n\n\nTHE journey from New York to Philadelphia, is made by railroad, and \ntwo ferries; and usually occupies between five and six hours.  It \nwas a fine evening when we were passengers in the train:  and \nwatching the bright sunset from a little window near the door by \nwhich we sat, my attention was attracted to a remarkable appearance \nissuing from the windows of the gentleman\'s car immediately in \nfront of us, which I supposed for some time was occasioned by a \nnumber of industrious persons inside, ripping open feather-beds, \nand giving the feathers to the wind.  At length it occurred to me \nthat they were only spitting, which was indeed the case; though how \nany number of passengers which it was possible for that car to \ncontain, could have maintained such a playful and incessant shower \nof expectoration, I am still at a loss to understand:  \nnotwithstanding the experience in all salivatory phenomena which I \nafterwards acquired.\n\nI made acquaintance, on this journey, with a mild and modest young \nquaker, who opened the discourse by informing me, in a grave \nwhisper, that his grandfather was the inventor of cold-drawn castor \noil.  I mention the circumstance here, thinking it probable that \nthis is the first occasion on which the valuable medicine in \nquestion was ever used as a conversational aperient.\n\nWe reached the city, late that night.  Looking out of my chamber-\nwindow, before going to bed, I saw, on the opposite side of the \nway, a handsome building of white marble, which had a mournful \nghost-like aspect, dreary to behold.  I attributed this to the \nsombre influence of the night, and on rising in the morning looked \nout again, expecting to see its steps and portico thronged with \ngroups of people passing in and out.  The door was still tight \nshut, however; the same cold cheerless air prevailed:  and the \nbuilding looked as if the marble statue of Don Guzman could alone \nhave any business to transact within its gloomy walls.  I hastened \nto inquire its name and purpose, and then my surprise vanished.  It \nwas the Tomb of many fortunes; the Great Catacomb of investment; \nthe memorable United States Bank.\n\nThe stoppage of this bank, with all its ruinous consequences, had \ncast (as I was told on every side) a gloom on Philadelphia, under \nthe depressing effect of which it yet laboured.  It certainly did \nseem rather dull and out of spirits.\n\nIt is a handsome city, but distractingly regular.  After walking \nabout it for an hour or two, I felt that I would have given the \nworld for a crooked street.  The collar of my coat appeared to \nstiffen, and the brim of my bat to expand, beneath its quakery \ninfluence.  My hair shrunk into a sleek short crop, my hands folded \nthemselves upon my breast of their own calm accord, and thoughts of \ntaking lodgings in Mark Lane over against the Market Place, and of \nmaking a large fortune by speculations in corn, came over me \ninvoluntarily.\n\nPhiladelphia is most bountifully provided with fresh water, which \nis showered and jerked about, and turned on, and poured off, \neverywhere.  The Waterworks, which are on a height near the city, \nare no less ornamental than useful, being tastefully laid out as a \npublic garden, and kept in the best and neatest order.  The river \nis dammed at this point, and forced by its own power into certain \nhigh tanks or reservoirs, whence the whole city, to the top stories \nof the houses, is supplied at a very trifling expense.\n\nThere are various public institutions.  Among them a most excellent \nHospital - a quaker establishment, but not sectarian in the great \nbenefits it confers; a quiet, quaint old Library, named after \nFranklin; a handsome Exchange and Post Office; and so forth.  In \nconnection with the quaker Hospital, there is a picture by West, \nwhich is exhibited for the benefit of the funds of the institution.  \nThe subject is, our Saviour healing the sick, and it is, perhaps, \nas favourable a specimen of the master as can be seen anywhere.  \nWhether this be high or low praise, depends upon the reader\'s \ntaste.\n\nIn the same room, there is a very characteristic and life-like \nportrait by Mr. Sully, a distinguished American artist.\n\nMy stay in Philadelphia was very short, but what I saw of its \nsociety, I greatly liked.  Treating of its general characteristics, \nI should be disposed to say that it is more provincial than Boston \nor New York, and that there is afloat in the fair city, an \nassumption of taste and criticism, savouring rather of those \ngenteel discussions upon the same themes, in connection with \nShakspeare and the Musical Glasses, of which we read in the Vicar \nof Wakefield.  Near the city, is a most splendid unfinished marble \nstructure for the Girard College, founded by a deceased gentleman \nof that name and of enormous wealth, which, if completed according \nto the original design, will be perhaps the richest edifice of \nmodern times.  But the bequest is involved in legal disputes, and \npending them the work has stopped; so that like many other great \nundertakings in America, even this is rather going to be done one \nof these days, than doing now.\n\nIn the outskirts, stands a great prison, called the Eastern \nPenitentiary:  conducted on a plan peculiar to the state of \nPennsylvania.  The system here, is rigid, strict, and hopeless \nsolitary confinement.  I believe it, in its effects, to be cruel \nand wrong.\n\nIn its intention, I am well convinced that it is kind, humane, and \nmeant for reformation; but I am persuaded that those who devised \nthis system of Prison Discipline, and those benevolent gentlemen \nwho carry it into execution, do not know what it is that they are \ndoing.  I believe that very few men are capable of estimating the \nimmense amount of torture and agony which this dreadful punishment, \nprolonged for years, inflicts upon the sufferers; and in guessing \nat it myself, and in reasoning from what I have seen written upon \ntheir faces, and what to my certain knowledge they feel within, I \nam only the more convinced that there is a depth of terrible \nendurance in it which none but the sufferers themselves can fathom, \nand which no man has a right to inflict upon his fellow-creature.  \nI hold this slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the \nbrain, to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body:  and \nbecause its ghastly signs and tokens are not so palpable to the eye \nand sense of touch as scars upon the flesh; because its wounds are \nnot upon the surface, and it extorts few cries that human ears can \nhear; therefore I the more denounce it, as a secret punishment \nwhich slumbering humanity is not roused up to stay.  I hesitated \nonce, debating with myself, whether, if I had the power of saying \n\'Yes\' or \'No,\' I would allow it to be tried in certain cases, where \nthe terms of imprisonment were short; but now, I solemnly declare, \nthat with no rewards or honours could I walk a happy man beneath \nthe open sky by day, or lie me down upon my bed at night, with the \nconsciousness that one human creature, for any length of time, no \nmatter what, lay suffering this unknown punishment in his silent \ncell, and I the cause, or I consenting to it in the least degree.\n\nI was accompanied to this prison by two gentlemen officially \nconnected with its management, and passed the day in going from \ncell to cell, and talking with the inmates.  Every facility was \nafforded me, that the utmost courtesy could suggest.  Nothing was \nconcealed or hidden from my view, and every piece of information \nthat I sought, was openly and frankly given.  The perfect order of \nthe building cannot be praised too highly, and of the excellent \nmotives of all who are immediately concerned in the administration \nof the system, there can be no kind of question.\n\nBetween the body of the prison and the outer wall, there is a \nspacious garden.  Entering it, by a wicket in the massive gate, we \npursued the path before us to its other termination, and passed \ninto a large chamber, from which seven long passages radiate.  On \neither side of each, is a long, long row of low cell doors, with a \ncertain number over every one.  Above, a gallery of cells like \nthose below, except that they have no narrow yard attached (as \nthose in the ground tier have), and are somewhat smaller.  The \npossession of two of these, is supposed to compensate for the \nabsence of so much air and exercise as can be had in the dull strip \nattached to each of the others, in an hour\'s time every day; and \ntherefore every prisoner in this upper story has two cells, \nadjoining and communicating with, each other.\n\nStanding at the central point, and looking down these dreary \npassages, the dull repose and quiet that prevails, is awful.  \nOccasionally, there is a drowsy sound from some lone weaver\'s \nshuttle, or shoemaker\'s last, but it is stifled by the thick walls \nand heavy dungeon-door, and only serves to make the general \nstillness more profound.  Over the head and face of every prisoner \nwho comes into this melancholy house, a black hood is drawn; and in \nthis dark shroud, an emblem of the curtain dropped between him and \nthe living world, he is led to the cell from which he never again \ncomes forth, until his whole term of imprisonment has expired.  He \nnever hears of wife and children; home or friends; the life or \ndeath of any single creature.  He sees the prison-officers, but \nwith that exception he never looks upon a human countenance, or \nhears a human voice.  He is a man buried alive; to be dug out in \nthe slow round of years; and in the mean time dead to everything \nbut torturing anxieties and horrible despair.\n\nHis name, and crime, and term of suffering, are unknown, even to \nthe officer who delivers him his daily food.  There is a number \nover his cell-door, and in a book of which the governor of the \nprison has one copy, and the moral instructor another:  this is the \nindex of his history.  Beyond these pages the prison has no record \nof his existence:  and though he live to be in the same cell ten \nweary years, he has no means of knowing, down to the very last \nhour, in which part of the building it is situated; what kind of \nmen there are about him; whether in the long winter nights there \nare living people near, or he is in some lonely corner of the great \njail, with walls, and passages, and iron doors between him and the \nnearest sharer in its solitary horrors.\n\nEvery cell has double doors:  the outer one of sturdy oak, the \nother of grated iron, wherein there is a trap through which his \nfood is handed.  He has a Bible, and a slate and pencil, and, under \ncertain restrictions, has sometimes other books, provided for the \npurpose, and pen and ink and paper.  His razor, plate, and can, and \nbasin, hang upon the wall, or shine upon the little shelf.  Fresh \nwater is laid on in every cell, and he can draw it at his pleasure.  \nDuring the day, his bedstead turns up against the wall, and leaves \nmore space for him to work in.  His loom, or bench, or wheel, is \nthere; and there he labours, sleeps and wakes, and counts the \nseasons as they change, and grows old.\n\nThe first man I saw, was seated at his loom, at work.  He had been \nthere six years, and was to remain, I think, three more.  He had \nbeen convicted as a receiver of stolen goods, but even after his \nlong imprisonment, denied his guilt, and said he had been hardly \ndealt by.  It was his second offence.\n\nHe stopped his work when we went in, took off his spectacles, and \nanswered freely to everything that was said to him, but always with \na strange kind of pause first, and in a low, thoughtful voice.  He \nwore a paper hat of his own making, and was pleased to have it \nnoticed and commanded.  He had very ingeniously manufactured a sort \nof Dutch clock from some disregarded odds and ends; and his \nvinegar-bottle served for the pendulum.  Seeing me interested in \nthis contrivance, he looked up at it with a great deal of pride, \nand said that he had been thinking of improving it, and that he \nhoped the hammer and a little piece of broken glass beside it \n\'would play music before long.\'  He had extracted some colours from \nthe yarn with which he worked, and painted a few poor figures on \nthe wall.  One, of a female, over the door, he called \'The Lady of \nthe Lake.\'\n\nHe smiled as I looked at these contrivances to while away the time; \nbut when I looked from them to him, I saw that his lip trembled, \nand could have counted the beating of his heart.  I forget how it \ncame about, but some allusion was made to his having a wife.  He \nshook his head at the word, turned aside, and covered his face with \nhis hands.\n\n\'But you are resigned now!\' said one of the gentlemen after a short \npause, during which he had resumed his former manner.  He answered \nwith a sigh that seemed quite reckless in its hopelessness, \'Oh \nyes, oh yes!  I am resigned to it.\'  \'And are a better man, you \nthink?\'  \'Well, I hope so:  I\'m sure I hope I may be.\'  \'And time \ngoes pretty quickly?\'  \'Time is very long gentlemen, within these \nfour walls!\'\n\nHe gazed about him - Heaven only knows how wearily! - as he said \nthese words; and in the act of doing so, fell into a strange stare \nas if he had forgotten something.  A moment afterwards he sighed \nheavily, put on his spectacles, and went about his work again.\n\nIn another cell, there was a German, sentenced to five years\' \nimprisonment for larceny, two of which had just expired.  With \ncolours procured in the same manner, he had painted every inch of \nthe walls and ceiling quite beautifully.  He had laid out the few \nfeet of ground, behind, with exquisite neatness, and had made a \nlittle bed in the centre, that looked, by-the-bye, like a grave.  \nThe taste and ingenuity he had displayed in everything were most \nextraordinary; and yet a more dejected, heart-broken, wretched \ncreature, it would be difficult to imagine.  I never saw such a \npicture of forlorn affliction and distress of mind.  My heart bled \nfor him; and when the tears ran down his cheeks, and he took one of \nthe visitors aside, to ask, with his trembling hands nervously \nclutching at his coat to detain him, whether there was no hope of \nhis dismal sentence being commuted, the spectacle was really too \npainful to witness.  I never saw or heard of any kind of misery \nthat impressed me more than the wretchedness of this man.\n\nIn a third cell, was a tall, strong black, a burglar, working at \nhis proper trade of making screws and the like.  His time was \nnearly out.  He was not only a very dexterous thief, but was \nnotorious for his boldness and hardihood, and for the number of his \nprevious convictions.  He entertained us with a long account of his \nachievements, which he narrated with such infinite relish, that he \nactually seemed to lick his lips as he told us racy anecdotes of \nstolen plate, and of old ladies whom he had watched as they sat at \nwindows in silver spectacles (he had plainly had an eye to their \nmetal even from the other side of the street) and had afterwards \nrobbed.  This fellow, upon the slightest encouragement, would have \nmingled with his professional recollections the most detestable \ncant; but I am very much mistaken if he could have surpassed the \nunmitigated hypocrisy with which he declared that he blessed the \nday on which he came into that prison, and that he never would \ncommit another robbery as long as he lived.\n\nThere was one man who was allowed, as an indulgence, to keep \nrabbits.  His room having rather a close smell in consequence, they \ncalled to him at the door to come out into the passage.  He \ncomplied of course, and stood shading his haggard face in the \nunwonted sunlight of the great window, looking as wan and unearthly \nas if he had been summoned from the grave.  He had a white rabbit \nin his breast; and when the little creature, getting down upon the \nground, stole back into the cell, and he, being dismissed, crept \ntimidly after it, I thought it would have been very hard to say in \nwhat respect the man was the nobler animal of the two.\n\nThere was an English thief, who had been there but a few days out \nof seven years:  a villainous, low-browed, thin-lipped fellow, with \na white face; who had as yet no relish for visitors, and who, but \nfor the additional penalty, would have gladly stabbed me with his \nshoemaker\'s knife.  There was another German who had entered the \njail but yesterday, and who started from his bed when we looked in, \nand pleaded, in his broken English, very hard for work.  There was \na poet, who after doing two days\' work in every four-and-twenty \nhours, one for himself and one for the prison, wrote verses about \nships (he was by trade a mariner), and \'the maddening wine-cup,\' \nand his friends at home.  There were very many of them.  Some \nreddened at the sight of visitors, and some turned very pale.  Some \ntwo or three had prisoner nurses with them, for they were very \nsick; and one, a fat old negro whose leg had been taken off within \nthe jail, had for his attendant a classical scholar and an \naccomplished surgeon, himself a prisoner likewise.  Sitting upon \nthe stairs, engaged in some slight work, was a pretty coloured boy.  \n\'Is there no refuge for young criminals in Philadelphia, then?\' \nsaid I.  \'Yes, but only for white children.\'  Noble aristocracy in \ncrime\n\nThere was a sailor who had been there upwards of eleven years, and \nwho in a few months\' time would be free.  Eleven years of solitary \nconfinement!\n\n\'I am very glad to hear your time is nearly out.\'  What does he \nsay?  Nothing.  Why does he stare at his hands, and pick the flesh \nupon his fingers, and raise his eyes for an instant, every now and \nthen, to those bare walls which have seen his head turn grey?  It \nis a way he has sometimes.\n\nDoes he never look men in the face, and does he always pluck at \nthose hands of his, as though he were bent on parting skin and \nbone?  It is his humour:  nothing more.\n\nIt is his humour too, to say that he does not look forward to going \nout; that he is not glad the time is drawing near; that he did look \nforward to it once, but that was very long ago; that he has lost \nall care for everything.  It is his humour to be a helpless, \ncrushed, and broken man.  And, Heaven be his witness that he has \nhis humour thoroughly gratified!\n\nThere were three young women in adjoining cells, all convicted at \nthe same time of a conspiracy to rob their prosecutor.  In the \nsilence and solitude of their lives they had grown to be quite \nbeautiful.  Their looks were very sad, and might have moved the \nsternest visitor to tears, but not to that kind of sorrow which the \ncontemplation of the men awakens.  One was a young girl; not \ntwenty, as I recollect; whose snow-white room was hung with the \nwork of some former prisoner, and upon whose downcast face the sun \nin all its splendour shone down through the high chink in the wall, \nwhere one narrow strip of bright blue sky was visible.  She was \nvery penitent and quiet; had come to be resigned, she said (and I \nbelieve her); and had a mind at peace.  \'In a word, you are happy \nhere?\' said one of my companions.  She struggled - she did struggle \nvery hard - to answer, Yes; but raising her eyes, and meeting that \nglimpse of freedom overhead, she burst into tears, and said, \'She \ntried to be; she uttered no complaint; but it was natural that she \nshould sometimes long to go out of that one cell:  she could not \nhelp THAT,\' she sobbed, poor thing!\n\nI went from cell to cell that day; and every face I saw, or word I \nheard, or incident I noted, is present to my mind in all its \npainfulness.  But let me pass them by, for one, more pleasant, \nglance of a prison on the same plan which I afterwards saw at \nPittsburg.\n\nWhen I had gone over that, in the same manner, I asked the governor \nif he had any person in his charge who was shortly going out.  He \nhad one, he said, whose time was up next day; but he had only been \na prisoner two years.\n\nTwo years!  I looked back through two years of my own life - out of \njail, prosperous, happy, surrounded by blessings, comforts, good \nfortune - and thought how wide a gap it was, and how long those two \nyears passed in solitary captivity would have been.  I have the \nface of this man, who was going to be released next day, before me \nnow.  It is almost more memorable in its happiness than the other \nfaces in their misery.  How easy and how natural it was for him to \nsay that the system was a good one; and that the time went \'pretty \nquick - considering;\' and that when a man once felt that he had \noffended the law, and must satisfy it, \'he got along, somehow:\' and \nso forth!\n\n\'What did he call you back to say to you, in that strange flutter?\' \nI asked of my conductor, when he had locked the door and joined me \nin the passage.\n\n\'Oh!  That he was afraid the soles of his boots were not fit for \nwalking, as they were a good deal worn when he came in; and that he \nwould thank me very much to have them mended, ready.\'\n\nThose boots had been taken off his feet, and put away with the rest \nof his clothes, two years before!\n\nI took that opportunity of inquiring how they conducted themselves \nimmediately before going out; adding that I presumed they trembled \nvery much.\n\n\'Well, it\'s not so much a trembling,\' was the answer - \'though they \ndo quiver - as a complete derangement of the nervous system.  They \ncan\'t sign their names to the book; sometimes can\'t even hold the \npen; look about \'em without appearing to know why, or where they \nare; and sometimes get up and sit down again, twenty times in a \nminute.  This is when they\'re in the office, where they are taken \nwith the hood on, as they were brought in.  When they get outside \nthe gate, they stop, and look first one way and then the other; not \nknowing which to take.  Sometimes they stagger as if they were \ndrunk, and sometimes are forced to lean against the fence, they\'re \nso bad:- but they clear off in course of time.\'\n\nAs I walked among these solitary cells, and looked at the faces of \nthe men within them, I tried to picture to myself the thoughts and \nfeelings natural to their condition.  I imagined the hood just \ntaken off, and the scene of their captivity disclosed to them in \nall its dismal monotony.\n\nAt first, the man is stunned.  His confinement is a hideous vision; \nand his old life a reality.  He throws himself upon his bed, and \nlies there abandoned to despair.  By degrees the insupportable \nsolitude and barrenness of the place rouses him from this stupor, \nand when the trap in his grated door is opened, he humbly begs and \nprays for work.  \'Give me some work to do, or I shall go raving \nmad!\'\n\nHe has it; and by fits and starts applies himself to labour; but \nevery now and then there comes upon him a burning sense of the \nyears that must be wasted in that stone coffin, and an agony so \npiercing in the recollection of those who are hidden from his view \nand knowledge, that he starts from his seat, and striding up and \ndown the narrow room with both hands clasped on his uplifted head, \nhears spirits tempting him to beat his brains out on the wall.\n\nAgain he falls upon his bed, and lies there, moaning.  Suddenly he \nstarts up, wondering whether any other man is near; whether there \nis another cell like that on either side of him:  and listens \nkeenly.\n\nThere is no sound, but other prisoners may be near for all that.  \nHe remembers to have heard once, when he little thought of coming \nhere himself, that the cells were so constructed that the prisoners \ncould not hear each other, though the officers could hear them.\n\nWhere is the nearest man - upon the right, or on the left? or is \nthere one in both directions?  Where is he sitting now - with his \nface to the light? or is he walking to and fro?  How is he dressed?  \nHas he been here long?  Is he much worn away?  Is he very white and \nspectre-like?  Does HE think of his neighbour too?\n\nScarcely venturing to breathe, and listening while he thinks, he \nconjures up a figure with his back towards him, and imagines it \nmoving about in this next cell.  He has no idea of the face, but he \nis certain of the dark form of a stooping man.  In the cell upon \nthe other side, he puts another figure, whose face is hidden from \nhim also.  Day after day, and often when he wakes up in the middle \nof the night, he thinks of these two men until he is almost \ndistracted.  He never changes them.  There they are always as he \nfirst imagined them - an old man on the right; a younger man upon \nthe left - whose hidden features torture him to death, and have a \nmystery that makes him tremble.\n\nThe weary days pass on with solemn pace, like mourners at a \nfuneral; and slowly he begins to feel that the white walls of the \ncell have something dreadful in them:  that their colour is \nhorrible:  that their smooth surface chills his blood:  that there \nis one hateful corner which torments him.  Every morning when he \nwakes, he hides his head beneath the coverlet, and shudders to see \nthe ghastly ceiling looking down upon him.  The blessed light of \nday itself peeps in, an ugly phantom face, through the unchangeable \ncrevice which is his prison window.\n\nBy slow but sure degrees, the terrors of that hateful corner swell \nuntil they beset him at all times; invade his rest, make his dreams \nhideous, and his nights dreadful.  At first, he took a strange \ndislike to it; feeling as though it gave birth in his brain to \nsomething of corresponding shape, which ought not to be there, and \nracked his head with pains.  Then he began to fear it, then to \ndream of it, and of men whispering its name and pointing to it.  \nThen he could not bear to look at it, nor yet to turn his back upon \nit.  Now, it is every night the lurking-place of a ghost:  a \nshadow:- a silent something, horrible to see, but whether bird, or \nbeast, or muffled human shape, he cannot tell.\n\nWhen he is in his cell by day, he fears the little yard without.  \nWhen he is in the yard, he dreads to re-enter the cell.  When night \ncomes, there stands the phantom in the corner.  If he have the \ncourage to stand in its place, and drive it out (he had once:  \nbeing desperate), it broods upon his bed.  In the twilight, and \nalways at the same hour, a voice calls to him by name; as the \ndarkness thickens, his Loom begins to live; and even that, his \ncomfort, is a hideous figure, watching him till daybreak.\n\nAgain, by slow degrees, these horrible fancies depart from him one \nby one:  returning sometimes, unexpectedly, but at longer \nintervals, and in less alarming shapes.  He has talked upon \nreligious matters with the gentleman who visits him, and has read \nhis Bible, and has written a prayer upon his slate, and hung it up \nas a kind of protection, and an assurance of Heavenly \ncompanionship.  He dreams now, sometimes, of his children or his \nwife, but is sure that they are dead, or have deserted him.  He is \neasily moved to tears; is gentle, submissive, and broken-spirited.  \nOccasionally, the old agony comes back:  a very little thing will \nrevive it; even a familiar sound, or the scent of summer flowers in \nthe air; but it does not last long, now:  for the world without, \nhas come to be the vision, and this solitary life, the sad reality.\n\nIf his term of imprisonment be short - I mean comparatively, for \nshort it cannot be - the last half year is almost worse than all; \nfor then he thinks the prison will take fire and he be burnt in the \nruins, or that he is doomed to die within the walls, or that he \nwill be detained on some false charge and sentenced for another \nterm:  or that something, no matter what, must happen to prevent \nhis going at large.  And this is natural, and impossible to be \nreasoned against, because, after his long separation from human \nlife, and his great suffering, any event will appear to him more \nprobable in the contemplation, than the being restored to liberty \nand his fellow-creatures.\n\nIf his period of confinement have been very long, the prospect of \nrelease bewilders and confuses him.  His broken heart may flutter \nfor a moment, when he thinks of the world outside, and what it \nmight have been to him in all those lonely years, but that is all.  \nThe cell-door has been closed too long on all its hopes and cares.  \nBetter to have hanged him in the beginning than bring him to this \npass, and send him forth to mingle with his kind, who are his kind \nno more.\n\nOn the haggard face of every man among these prisoners, the same \nexpression sat.  I know not what to liken it to.  It had something \nof that strained attention which we see upon the faces of the blind \nand deaf, mingled with a kind of horror, as though they had all \nbeen secretly terrified.  In every little chamber that I entered, \nand at every grate through which I looked, I seemed to see the same \nappalling countenance.  It lives in my memory, with the fascination \nof a remarkable picture.  Parade before my eyes, a hundred men, \nwith one among them newly released from this solitary suffering, \nand I would point him out.\n\nThe faces of the women, as I have said, it humanises and refines.  \nWhether this be because of their better nature, which is elicited \nin solitude, or because of their being gentler creatures, of \ngreater patience and longer suffering, I do not know; but so it is.  \nThat the punishment is nevertheless, to my thinking, fully as cruel \nand as wrong in their case, as in that of the men, I need scarcely \nadd.\n\nMy firm conviction is that, independent of the mental anguish it \noccasions - an anguish so acute and so tremendous, that all \nimagination of it must fall far short of the reality - it wears the \nmind into a morbid state, which renders it unfit for the rough \ncontact and busy action of the world.  It is my fixed opinion that \nthose who have undergone this punishment, MUST pass into society \nagain morally unhealthy and diseased.  There are many instances on \nrecord, of men who have chosen, or have been condemned, to lives of \nperfect solitude, but I scarcely remember one, even among sages of \nstrong and vigorous intellect, where its effect has not become \napparent, in some disordered train of thought, or some gloomy \nhallucination.  What monstrous phantoms, bred of despondency and \ndoubt, and born and reared in solitude, have stalked upon the \nearth, making creation ugly, and darkening the face of Heaven!\n\nSuicides are rare among these prisoners:  are almost, indeed, \nunknown.  But no argument in favour of the system, can reasonably \nbe deduced from this circumstance, although it is very often urged.  \nAll men who have made diseases of the mind their study, know \nperfectly well that such extreme depression and despair as will \nchange the whole character, and beat down all its powers of \nelasticity and self-resistance, may be at work within a man, and \nyet stop short of self-destruction.  This is a common case.\n\nThat it makes the senses dull, and by degrees impairs the bodily \nfaculties, I am quite sure.  I remarked to those who were with me \nin this very establishment at Philadelphia, that the criminals who \nhad been there long, were deaf.  They, who were in the habit of \nseeing these men constantly, were perfectly amazed at the idea, \nwhich they regarded as groundless and fanciful.  And yet the very \nfirst prisoner to whom they appealed - one of their own selection \nconfirmed my impression (which was unknown to him) instantly, and \nsaid, with a genuine air it was impossible to doubt, that he \ncouldn\'t think how it happened, but he WAS growing very dull of \nhearing.\n\nThat it is a singularly unequal punishment, and affects the worst \nman least, there is no doubt.  In its superior efficiency as a \nmeans of reformation, compared with that other code of regulations \nwhich allows the prisoners to work in company without communicating \ntogether, I have not the smallest faith.  All the instances of \nreformation that were mentioned to me, were of a kind that might \nhave been - and I have no doubt whatever, in my own mind, would \nhave been - equally well brought about by the Silent System.  With \nregard to such men as the negro burglar and the English thief, even \nthe most enthusiastic have scarcely any hope of their conversion.\n\nIt seems to me that the objection that nothing wholesome or good \nhas ever had its growth in such unnatural solitude, and that even a \ndog or any of the more intelligent among beasts, would pine, and \nmope, and rust away, beneath its influence, would be in itself a \nsufficient argument against this system.  But when we recollect, in \naddition, how very cruel and severe it is, and that a solitary life \nis always liable to peculiar and distinct objections of a most \ndeplorable nature, which have arisen here, and call to mind, \nmoreover, that the choice is not between this system, and a bad or \nill-considered one, but between it and another which has worked \nwell, and is, in its whole design and practice, excellent; there is \nsurely more than sufficient reason for abandoning a mode of \npunishment attended by so little hope or promise, and fraught, \nbeyond dispute, with such a host of evils.\n\nAs a relief to its contemplation, I will close this chapter with a \ncurious story arising out of the same theme, which was related to \nme, on the occasion of this visit, by some of the gentlemen \nconcerned.\n\nAt one of the periodical meetings of the inspectors of this prison, \na working man of Philadelphia presented himself before the Board, \nand earnestly requested to be placed in solitary confinement.  On \nbeing asked what motive could possibly prompt him to make this \nstrange demand, he answered that he had an irresistible propensity \nto get drunk; that he was constantly indulging it, to his great \nmisery and ruin; that he had no power of resistance; that he wished \nto be put beyond the reach of temptation; and that he could think \nof no better way than this.  It was pointed out to him, in reply, \nthat the prison was for criminals who had been tried and sentenced \nby the law, and could not be made available for any such fanciful \npurposes; he was exhorted to abstain from intoxicating drinks, as \nhe surely might if he would; and received other very good advice, \nwith which he retired, exceedingly dissatisfied with the result of \nhis application.\n\nHe came again, and again, and again, and was so very earnest and \nimportunate, that at last they took counsel together, and said, \'He \nwill certainly qualify himself for admission, if we reject him any \nmore.  Let us shut him up.  He will soon be glad to go away, and \nthen we shall get rid of him.\'  So they made him sign a statement \nwhich would prevent his ever sustaining an action for false \nimprisonment, to the effect that his incarceration was voluntary, \nand of his own seeking; they requested him to take notice that the \nofficer in attendance had orders to release him at any hour of the \nday or night, when he might knock upon his door for that purpose; \nbut desired him to understand, that once going out, he would not be \nadmitted any more.  These conditions agreed upon, and he still \nremaining in the same mind, he was conducted to the prison, and \nshut up in one of the cells.\n\nIn this cell, the man, who had not the firmness to leave a glass of \nliquor standing untasted on a table before him - in this cell, in \nsolitary confinement, and working every day at his trade of \nshoemaking, this man remained nearly two years.  His health \nbeginning to fail at the expiration of that time, the surgeon \nrecommended that he should work occasionally in the garden; and as \nhe liked the notion very much, he went about this new occupation \nwith great cheerfulness.\n\nHe was digging here, one summer day, very industriously, when the \nwicket in the outer gate chanced to be left open:  showing, beyond, \nthe well-remembered dusty road and sunburnt fields.  The way was as \nfree to him as to any man living, but he no sooner raised his head \nand caught sight of it, all shining in the light, than, with the \ninvoluntary instinct of a prisoner, he cast away his spade, \nscampered off as fast as his legs would carry him, and never once \nlooked back.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII - WASHINGTON.  THE LEGISLATURE.  AND THE PRESIDENT\'S \nHOUSE\n\n\n\nWE left Philadelphia by steamboat, at six o\'clock one very cold \nmorning, and turned our faces towards Washington.\n\nIn the course of this day\'s journey, as on subsequent occasions, we \nencountered some Englishmen (small farmers, perhaps, or country \npublicans at home) who were settled in America, and were travelling \non their own affairs.  Of all grades and kinds of men that jostle \none in the public conveyances of the States, these are often the \nmost intolerable and the most insufferable companions.  United to \nevery disagreeable characteristic that the worst kind of American \ntravellers possess, these countrymen of ours display an amount of \ninsolent conceit and cool assumption of superiority, quite \nmonstrous to behold.  In the coarse familiarity of their approach, \nand the effrontery of their inquisitiveness (which they are in \ngreat haste to assert, as if they panted to revenge themselves upon \nthe decent old restraints of home), they surpass any native \nspecimens that came within my range of observation:  and I often \ngrew so patriotic when I saw and heard them, that I would \ncheerfully have submitted to a reasonable fine, if I could have \ngiven any other country in the whole world, the honour of claiming \nthem for its children.\n\nAs Washington may be called the head-quarters of tobacco-tinctured \nsaliva, the time is come when I must confess, without any disguise, \nthat the prevalence of those two odious practices of chewing and \nexpectorating began about this time to be anything but agreeable, \nand soon became most offensive and sickening.  In all the public \nplaces of America, this filthy custom is recognised.  In the courts \nof law, the judge has his spittoon, the crier his, the witness his, \nand the prisoner his; while the jurymen and spectators are provided \nfor, as so many men who in the course of nature must desire to spit \nincessantly.  In the hospitals, the students of medicine are \nrequested, by notices upon the wall, to eject their tobacco juice \ninto the boxes provided for that purpose, and not to discolour the \nstairs.  In public buildings, visitors are implored, through the \nsame agency, to squirt the essence of their quids, or \'plugs,\' as I \nhave heard them called by gentlemen learned in this kind of \nsweetmeat, into the national spittoons, and not about the bases of \nthe marble columns.  But in some parts, this custom is inseparably \nmixed up with every meal and morning call, and with all the \ntransactions of social life.  The stranger, who follows in the \ntrack I took myself, will find it in its full bloom and glory, \nluxuriant in all its alarming recklessness, at Washington.  And let \nhim not persuade himself (as I once did, to my shame) that previous \ntourists have exaggerated its extent.  The thing itself is an \nexaggeration of nastiness, which cannot be outdone.\n\nOn board this steamboat, there were two young gentlemen, with \nshirt-collars reversed as usual, and armed with very big walking-\nsticks; who planted two seats in the middle of the deck, at a \ndistance of some four paces apart; took out their tobacco-boxes; \nand sat down opposite each other, to chew.  In less than a quarter \nof an hour\'s time, these hopeful youths had shed about them on the \nclean boards, a copious shower of yellow rain; clearing, by that \nmeans, a kind of magic circle, within whose limits no intruders \ndared to come, and which they never failed to refresh and re-\nrefresh before a spot was dry.  This being before breakfast, rather \ndisposed me, I confess, to nausea; but looking attentively at one \nof the expectorators, I plainly saw that he was young in chewing, \nand felt inwardly uneasy, himself.  A glow of delight came over me \nat this discovery; and as I marked his face turn paler and paler, \nand saw the ball of tobacco in his left cheek, quiver with his \nsuppressed agony, while yet he spat, and chewed, and spat again, in \nemulation of his older friend, I could have fallen on his neck and \nimplored him to go on for hours.\n\nWe all sat down to a comfortable breakfast in the cabin below, \nwhere there was no more hurry or confusion than at such a meal in \nEngland, and where there was certainly greater politeness exhibited \nthan at most of our stage-coach banquets.  At about nine o\'clock we \narrived at the railroad station, and went on by the cars.  At noon \nwe turned out again, to cross a wide river in another steamboat; \nlanded at a continuation of the railroad on the opposite shore; and \nwent on by other cars; in which, in the course of the next hour or \nso, we crossed by wooden bridges, each a mile in length, two \ncreeks, called respectively Great and Little Gunpowder.  The water \nin both was blackened with flights of canvas-backed ducks, which \nare most delicious eating, and abound hereabouts at that season of \nthe year.\n\nThese bridges are of wood, have no parapet, and are only just wide \nenough for the passage of the trains; which, in the event of the \nsmallest accident, wound inevitably be plunged into the river.  \nThey are startling contrivances, and are most agreeable when \npassed.\n\nWe stopped to dine at Baltimore, and being now in Maryland, were \nwaited on, for the first time, by slaves.  The sensation of \nexacting any service from human creatures who are bought and sold, \nand being, for the time, a party as it were to their condition, is \nnot an enviable one.  The institution exists, perhaps, in its least \nrepulsive and most mitigated form in such a town as this; but it IS \nslavery; and though I was, with respect to it, an innocent man, its \npresence filled me with a sense of shame and self-reproach.\n\nAfter dinner, we went down to the railroad again, and took our \nseats in the cars for Washington.  Being rather early, those men \nand boys who happened to have nothing particular to do, and were \ncurious in foreigners, came (according to custom) round the \ncarriage in which I sat; let down all the windows; thrust in their \nheads and shoulders; hooked themselves on conveniently, by their \nelbows; and fell to comparing notes on the subject of my personal \nappearance, with as much indifference as if I were a stuffed \nfigure.  I never gained so much uncompromising information with \nreference to my own nose and eyes, and various impressions wrought \nby my mouth and chin on different minds, and how my head looks when \nit is viewed from behind, as on these occasions.  Some gentlemen \nwere only satisfied by exercising their sense of touch; and the \nboys (who are surprisingly precocious in America) were seldom \nsatisfied, even by that, but would return to the charge over and \nover again.  Many a budding president has walked into my room with \nhis cap on his head and his hands in his pockets, and stared at me \nfor two whole hours:  occasionally refreshing himself with a tweak \nof his nose, or a draught from the water-jug; or by walking to the \nwindows and inviting other boys in the street below, to come up and \ndo likewise:  crying, \'Here he is!\'  \'Come on!\'  \'Bring all your \nbrothers!\' with other hospitable entreaties of that nature.\n\nWe reached Washington at about half-past six that evening, and had \nupon the way a beautiful view of the Capitol, which is a fine \nbuilding of the Corinthian order, placed upon a noble and \ncommanding eminence.  Arrived at the hotel; I saw no more of the \nplace that night; being very tired, and glad to get to bed.\n\nBreakfast over next morning, I walk about the streets for an hour \nor two, and, coming home, throw up the window in the front and \nback, and look out.  Here is Washington, fresh in my mind and under \nmy eye.\n\nTake the worst parts of the City Road and Pentonville, or the \nstraggling outskirts of Paris, where the houses are smallest, \npreserving all their oddities, but especially the small shops and \ndwellings, occupied in Pentonville (but not in Washington) by \nfurniture-brokers, keepers of poor eating-houses, and fanciers of \nbirds.  Burn the whole down; build it up again in wood and plaster; \nwiden it a little; throw in part of St. John\'s Wood; put green \nblinds outside all the private houses, with a red curtain and a \nwhite one in every window; plough up all the roads; plant a great \ndeal of coarse turf in every place where it ought NOT to be; erect \nthree handsome buildings in stone and marble, anywhere, but the \nmore entirely out of everybody\'s way the better; call one the Post \nOffice; one the Patent Office, and one the Treasury; make it \nscorching hot in the morning, and freezing cold in the afternoon, \nwith an occasional tornado of wind and dust; leave a brick-field \nwithout the bricks, in all central places where a street may \nnaturally be expected:  and that\'s Washington.\n\nThe hotel in which we live, is a long row of small houses fronting \non the street, and opening at the back upon a common yard, in which \nhangs a great triangle.  Whenever a servant is wanted, somebody \nbeats on this triangle from one stroke up to seven, according to \nthe number of the house in which his presence is required; and as \nall the servants are always being wanted, and none of them ever \ncome, this enlivening engine is in full performance the whole day \nthrough.  Clothes are drying in the same yard; female slaves, with \ncotton handkerchiefs twisted round their heads are running to and \nfro on the hotel business; black waiters cross and recross with \ndishes in their hands; two great dogs are playing upon a mound of \nloose bricks in the centre of the little square; a pig is turning \nup his stomach to the sun, and grunting \'that\'s comfortable!\'; and \nneither the men, nor the women, nor the dogs, nor the pig, nor any \ncreated creature, takes the smallest notice of the triangle, which \nis tingling madly all the time.\n\nI walk to the front window, and look across the road upon a long, \nstraggling row of houses, one story high, terminating, nearly \nopposite, but a little to the left, in a melancholy piece of waste \nground with frowzy grass, which looks like a small piece of country \nthat has taken to drinking, and has quite lost itself.  Standing \nanyhow and all wrong, upon this open space, like something meteoric \nthat has fallen down from the moon, is an odd, lop-sided, one-eyed \nkind of wooden building, that looks like a church, with a flag-\nstaff as long as itself sticking out of a steeple something larger \nthan a tea-chest.  Under the window is a small stand of coaches, \nwhose slave-drivers are sunning themselves on the steps of our \ndoor, and talking idly together.  The three most obtrusive houses \nnear at hand are the three meanest.  On one - a shop, which never \nhas anything in the window, and never has the door open - is \npainted in large characters, \'THE CITY LUNCH.\'  At another, which \nlooks like a backway to somewhere else, but is an independent \nbuilding in itself, oysters are procurable in every style.  At the \nthird, which is a very, very little tailor\'s shop, pants are fixed \nto order; or in other words, pantaloons are made to measure.  And \nthat is our street in Washington.\n\nIt is sometimes called the City of Magnificent Distances, but it \nmight with greater propriety be termed the City of Magnificent \nIntentions; for it is only on taking a bird\'s-eye view of it from \nthe top of the Capitol, that one can at all comprehend the vast \ndesigns of its projector, an aspiring Frenchman.  Spacious avenues, \nthat begin in nothing, and lead nowhere; streets, mile-long, that \nonly want houses, roads and inhabitants; public buildings that need \nbut a public to be complete; and ornaments of great thoroughfares, \nwhich only lack great thoroughfares to ornament - are its leading \nfeatures.  One might fancy the season over, and most of the houses \ngone out of town for ever with their masters.  To the admirers of \ncities it is a Barmecide Feast:  a pleasant field for the \nimagination to rove in; a monument raised to a deceased project, \nwith not even a legible inscription to record its departed \ngreatness.\n\nSuch as it is, it is likely to remain.  It was originally chosen \nfor the seat of Government, as a means of averting the conflicting \njealousies and interests of the different States; and very \nprobably, too, as being remote from mobs:  a consideration not to \nbe slighted, even in America.  It has no trade or commerce of its \nown:  having little or no population beyond the President and his \nestablishment; the members of the legislature who reside there \nduring the session; the Government clerks and officers employed in \nthe various departments; the keepers of the hotels and boarding-\nhouses; and the tradesmen who supply their tables.  It is very \nunhealthy.  Few people would live in Washington, I take it, who \nwere not obliged to reside there; and the tides of emigration and \nspeculation, those rapid and regardless currents, are little likely \nto flow at any time towards such dull and sluggish water.\n\nThe principal features of the Capitol, are, of course, the two \nhouses of Assembly.  But there is, besides, in the centre of the \nbuilding, a fine rotunda, ninety-six feet in diameter, and ninety-\nsix high, whose circular wall is divided into compartments, \nornamented by historical pictures.  Four of these have for their \nsubjects prominent events in the revolutionary struggle.  They were \npainted by Colonel Trumbull, himself a member of Washington\'s staff \nat the time of their occurrence; from which circumstance they \nderive a peculiar interest of their own.  In this same hall Mr. \nGreenough\'s large statue of Washington has been lately placed.  It \nhas great merits of course, but it struck me as being rather \nstrained and violent for its subject.  I could wish, however, to \nhave seen it in a better light than it can ever be viewed in, where \nit stands.\n\nThere is a very pleasant and commodious library in the Capitol; and \nfrom a balcony in front, the bird\'s-eye view, of which I have just \nspoken, may be had, together with a beautiful prospect of the \nadjacent country.  In one of the ornamented portions of the \nbuilding, there is a figure of Justice; whereunto the Guide Book \nsays, \'the artist at first contemplated giving more of nudity, but \nhe was warned that the public sentiment in this country would not \nadmit of it, and in his caution he has gone, perhaps, into the \nopposite extreme.\'  Poor Justice! she has been made to wear much \nstranger garments in America than those she pines in, in the \nCapitol.  Let us hope that she has changed her dress-maker since \nthey were fashioned, and that the public sentiment of the country \ndid not cut out the clothes she hides her lovely figure in, just \nnow.\n\nThe House of Representatives is a beautiful and spacious hall, of \nsemicircular shape, supported by handsome pillars.  One part of the \ngallery is appropriated to the ladies, and there they sit in front \nrows, and come in, and go out, as at a play or concert.  The chair \nis canopied, and raised considerably above the floor of the House; \nand every member has an easy chair and a writing desk to himself:  \nwhich is denounced by some people out of doors as a most \nunfortunate and injudicious arrangement, tending to long sittings \nand prosaic speeches.  It is an elegant chamber to look at, but a \nsingularly bad one for all purposes of hearing.  The Senate, which \nis smaller, is free from this objection, and is exceedingly well \nadapted to the uses for which it is designed.  The sittings, I need \nhardly add, take place in the day; and the parliamentary forms are \nmodelled on those of the old country.\n\nI was sometimes asked, in my progress through other places, whether \nI had not been very much impressed by the HEADS of the lawmakers at \nWashington; meaning not their chiefs and leaders, but literally \ntheir individual and personal heads, whereon their hair grew, and \nwhereby the phrenological character of each legislator was \nexpressed:  and I almost as often struck my questioner dumb with \nindignant consternation by answering \'No, that I didn\'t remember \nbeing at all overcome.\'  As I must, at whatever hazard, repeat the \navowal here, I will follow it up by relating my impressions on this \nsubject in as few words as possible.\n\nIn the first place - it may be from some imperfect development of \nmy organ of veneration - I do not remember having ever fainted \naway, or having even been moved to tears of joyful pride, at sight \nof any legislative body.  I have borne the House of Commons like a \nman, and have yielded to no weakness, but slumber, in the House of \nLords.  I have seen elections for borough and county, and have \nnever been impelled (no matter which party won) to damage my hat by \nthrowing it up into the air in triumph, or to crack my voice by \nshouting forth any reference to our Glorious Constitution, to the \nnoble purity of our independent voters, or, the unimpeachable \nintegrity of our independent members.  Having withstood such strong \nattacks upon my fortitude, it is possible that I may be of a cold \nand insensible temperament, amounting to iciness, in such matters; \nand therefore my impressions of the live pillars of the Capitol at \nWashington must be received with such grains of allowance as this \nfree confession may seem to demand.\n\nDid I see in this public body an assemblage of men, bound together \nin the sacred names of Liberty and Freedom, and so asserting the \nchaste dignity of those twin goddesses, in all their discussions, \nas to exalt at once the Eternal Principles to which their names are \ngiven, and their own character and the character of their \ncountrymen, in the admiring eyes of the whole world?\n\nIt was but a week, since an aged, grey-haired man, a lasting honour \nto the land that gave him birth, who has done good service to his \ncountry, as his forefathers did, and who will be remembered scores \nupon scores of years after the worms bred in its corruption, are \nbut so many grains of dust - it was but a week, since this old man \nhad stood for days upon his trial before this very body, charged \nwith having dared to assert the infamy of that traffic, which has \nfor its accursed merchandise men and women, and their unborn \nchildren.  Yes.  And publicly exhibited in the same city all the \nwhile; gilded, framed and glazed hung up for general admiration; \nshown to strangers not with shame, but pride; its face not turned \ntowards the wall, itself not taken down and burned; is the \nUnanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America, \nwhich solemnly declares that All Men are created Equal; and are \nendowed by their Creator with the Inalienable Rights of Life, \nLiberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness!\n\nIt was not a month, since this same body had sat calmly by, and \nheard a man, one of themselves, with oaths which beggars in their \ndrink reject, threaten to cut another\'s throat from ear to ear.  \nThere he sat, among them; not crushed by the general feeling of the \nassembly, but as good a man as any.\n\nThere was but a week to come, and another of that body, for doing \nhis duty to those who sent him there; for claiming in a Republic \nthe Liberty and Freedom of expressing their sentiments, and making \nknown their prayer; would be tried, found guilty, and have strong \ncensure passed upon him by the rest.  His was a grave offence \nindeed; for years before, he had risen up and said, \'A gang of male \nand female slaves for sale, warranted to breed like cattle, linked \nto each other by iron fetters, are passing now along the open \nstreet beneath the windows of your Temple of Equality!  Look!\'  But \nthere are many kinds of hunters engaged in the Pursuit of \nHappiness, and they go variously armed.  It is the Inalienable \nRight of some among them, to take the field after THEIR Happiness \nequipped with cat and cartwhip, stocks, and iron collar, and to \nshout their view halloa! (always in praise of Liberty) to the music \nof clanking chains and bloody stripes.\n\nWhere sat the many legislators of coarse threats; of words and \nblows such as coalheavers deal upon each other, when they forget \ntheir breeding?  On every side.  Every session had its anecdotes of \nthat kind, and the actors were all there.\n\nDid I recognise in this assembly, a body of men, who, applying \nthemselves in a new world to correct some of the falsehoods and \nvices of the old, purified the avenues to Public Life, paved the \ndirty ways to Place and Power, debated and made laws for the Common \nGood, and had no party but their Country?\n\nI saw in them, the wheels that move the meanest perversion of \nvirtuous Political Machinery that the worst tools ever wrought.  \nDespicable trickery at elections; under-handed tamperings with \npublic officers; cowardly attacks upon opponents, with scurrilous \nnewspapers for shields, and hired pens for daggers; shameful \ntrucklings to mercenary knaves, whose claim to be considered, is, \nthat every day and week they sow new crops of ruin with their venal \ntypes, which are the dragon\'s teeth of yore, in everything but \nsharpness; aidings and abettings of every bad inclination in the \npopular mind, and artful suppressions of all its good influences:  \nsuch things as these, and in a word, Dishonest Faction in its most \ndepraved and most unblushing form, stared out from every corner of \nthe crowded hall.\n\nDid I see among them, the intelligence and refinement:  the true, \nhonest, patriotic heart of America?  Here and there, were drops of \nits blood and life, but they scarcely coloured the stream of \ndesperate adventurers which sets that way for profit and for pay.  \nIt is the game of these men, and of their profligate organs, to \nmake the strife of politics so fierce and brutal, and so \ndestructive of all self-respect in worthy men, that sensitive and \ndelicate-minded persons shall be kept aloof, and they, and such as \nthey, be left to battle out their selfish views unchecked.  And \nthus this lowest of all scrambling fights goes on, and they who in \nother countries would, from their intelligence and station, most \naspire to make the laws, do here recoil the farthest from that \ndegradation.\n\nThat there are, among the representatives of the people in both \nHouses, and among all parties, some men of high character and great \nabilities, I need not say.  The foremost among those politicians \nwho are known in Europe, have been already described, and I see no \nreason to depart from the rule I have laid down for my guidance, of \nabstaining from all mention of individuals.  It will be sufficient \nto add, that to the most favourable accounts that have been written \nof them, I more than fully and most heartily subscribe; and that \npersonal intercourse and free communication have bred within me, \nnot the result predicted in the very doubtful proverb, but \nincreased admiration and respect.  They are striking men to look \nat, hard to deceive, prompt to act, lions in energy, Crichtons in \nvaried accomplishments, Indians in fire of eye and gesture, \nAmericans in strong and generous impulse; and they as well \nrepresent the honour and wisdom of their country at home, as the \ndistinguished gentleman who is now its Minister at the British \nCourt sustains its highest character abroad.\n\nI visited both houses nearly every day, during my stay in \nWashington.  On my initiatory visit to the House of \nRepresentatives, they divided against a decision of the chair; but \nthe chair won.  The second time I went, the member who was \nspeaking, being interrupted by a laugh, mimicked it, as one child \nwould in quarrelling with another, and added, \'that he would make \nhonourable gentlemen opposite, sing out a little more on the other \nside of their mouths presently.\'  But interruptions are rare; the \nspeaker being usually heard in silence.  There are more quarrels \nthan with us, and more threatenings than gentlemen are accustomed \nto exchange in any civilised society of which we have record:  but \nfarm-yard imitations have not as yet been imported from the \nParliament of the United Kingdom.  The feature in oratory which \nappears to be the most practised, and most relished, is the \nconstant repetition of the same idea or shadow of an idea in fresh \nwords; and the inquiry out of doors is not, \'What did he say?\' but, \n\'How long did he speak?\'  These, however, are but enlargements of a \nprinciple which prevails elsewhere.\n\nThe Senate is a dignified and decorous body, and its proceedings \nare conducted with much gravity and order.  Both houses are \nhandsomely carpeted; but the state to which these carpets are \nreduced by the universal disregard of the spittoon with which every \nhonourable member is accommodated, and the extraordinary \nimprovements on the pattern which are squirted and dabbled upon it \nin every direction, do not admit of being described.  I will merely \nobserve, that I strongly recommend all strangers not to look at the \nfloor; and if they happen to drop anything, though it be their \npurse, not to pick it up with an ungloved hand on any account.\n\nIt is somewhat remarkable too, at first, to say the least, to see \nso many honourable members with swelled faces; and it is scarcely \nless remarkable to discover that this appearance is caused by the \nquantity of tobacco they contrive to stow within the hollow of the \ncheek.  It is strange enough too, to see an honourable gentleman \nleaning back in his tilted chair with his legs on the desk before \nhim, shaping a convenient \'plug\' with his penknife, and when it is \nquite ready for use, shooting the old one from his mouth, as from a \npop-gun, and clapping the new one in its place.\n\nI was surprised to observe that even steady old chewers of great \nexperience, are not always good marksmen, which has rather inclined \nme to doubt that general proficiency with the rifle, of which we \nhave heard so much in England.  Several gentlemen called upon me \nwho, in the course of conversation, frequently missed the spittoon \nat five paces; and one (but he was certainly short-sighted) mistook \nthe closed sash for the open window, at three.  On another \noccasion, when I dined out, and was sitting with two ladies and \nsome gentlemen round a fire before dinner, one of the company fell \nshort of the fireplace, six distinct times.  I am disposed to \nthink, however, that this was occasioned by his not aiming at that \nobject; as there was a white marble hearth before the fender, which \nwas more convenient, and may have suited his purpose better.\n\nThe Patent Office at Washington, furnishes an extraordinary example \nof American enterprise and ingenuity; for the immense number of \nmodels it contains are the accumulated inventions of only five \nyears; the whole of the previous collection having been destroyed \nby fire.  The elegant structure in which they are arranged is one \nof design rather than execution, for there is but one side erected \nout of four, though the works are stopped.  The Post Office is a \nvery compact and very beautiful building.  In one of the \ndepartments, among a collection of rare and curious articles, are \ndeposited the presents which have been made from time to time to \nthe American ambassadors at foreign courts by the various \npotentates to whom they were the accredited agents of the Republic; \ngifts which by the law they are not permitted to retain.  I confess \nthat I looked upon this as a very painful exhibition, and one by no \nmeans flattering to the national standard of honesty and honour.  \nThat can scarcely be a high state of moral feeling which imagines a \ngentleman of repute and station, likely to be corrupted, in the \ndischarge of his duty, by the present of a snuff-box, or a richly-\nmounted sword, or an Eastern shawl; and surely the Nation who \nreposes confidence in her appointed servants, is likely to be \nbetter served, than she who makes them the subject of such very \nmean and paltry suspicions.\n\nAt George Town, in the suburbs, there is a Jesuit College; \ndelightfully situated, and, so far as I had an opportunity of \nseeing, well managed.  Many persons who are not members of the \nRomish Church, avail themselves, I believe, of these institutions, \nand of the advantageous opportunities they afford for the education \nof their children.  The heights of this neighbourhood, above the \nPotomac River, are very picturesque:  and are free, I should \nconceive, from some of the insalubrities of Washington.  The air, \nat that elevation, was quite cool and refreshing, when in the city \nit was burning hot.\n\nThe President\'s mansion is more like an English club-house, both \nwithin and without, than any other kind of establishment with which \nI can compare it.  The ornamental ground about it has been laid out \nin garden walks; they are pretty, and agreeable to the eye; though \nthey have that uncomfortable air of having been made yesterday, \nwhich is far from favourable to the display of such beauties.\n\nMy first visit to this house was on the morning after my arrival, \nwhen I was carried thither by an official gentleman, who was so \nkind as to charge himself with my presentation to the President.\n\nWe entered a large hall, and having twice or thrice rung a bell \nwhich nobody answered, walked without further ceremony through the \nrooms on the ground floor, as divers other gentlemen (mostly with \ntheir hats on, and their hands in their pockets) were doing very \nleisurely.  Some of these had ladies with them, to whom they were \nshowing the premises; others were lounging on the chairs and sofas; \nothers, in a perfect state of exhaustion from listlessness, were \nyawning drearily.  The greater portion of this assemblage were \nrather asserting their supremacy than doing anything else, as they \nhad no particular business there, that anybody knew of.  A few were \nclosely eyeing the movables, as if to make quite sure that the \nPresident (who was far from popular) had not made away with any of \nthe furniture, or sold the fixtures for his private benefit.\n\nAfter glancing at these loungers; who were scattered over a pretty \ndrawing-room, opening upon a terrace which commanded a beautiful \nprospect of the river and the adjacent country; and who were \nsauntering, too, about a larger state-room called the Eastern \nDrawing-room; we went up-stairs into another chamber, where were \ncertain visitors, waiting for audiences.  At sight of my conductor, \na black in plain clothes and yellow slippers who was gliding \nnoiselessly about, and whispering messages in the ears of the more \nimpatient, made a sign of recognition, and glided off to announce \nhim.\n\nWe had previously looked into another chamber fitted all round with \na great, bare, wooden desk or counter, whereon lay files of \nnewspapers, to which sundry gentlemen were referring.  But there \nwere no such means of beguiling the time in this apartment, which \nwas as unpromising and tiresome as any waiting-room in one of our \npublic establishments, or any physician\'s dining-room during his \nhours of consultation at home.\n\nThere were some fifteen or twenty persons in the room.  One, a \ntall, wiry, muscular old man, from the west; sunburnt and swarthy; \nwith a brown white hat on his knees, and a giant umbrella resting \nbetween his legs; who sat bolt upright in his chair, frowning \nsteadily at the carpet, and twitching the hard lines about his \nmouth, as if he had made up his mind \'to fix\' the President on what \nhe had to say, and wouldn\'t bate him a grain.  Another, a Kentucky \nfarmer, six-feet-six in height, with his hat on, and his hands \nunder his coat-tails, who leaned against the wall and kicked the \nfloor with his heel, as though he had Time\'s head under his shoe, \nand were literally \'killing\' him.  A third, an oval-faced, bilious-\nlooking man, with sleek black hair cropped close, and whiskers and \nbeard shaved down to blue dots, who sucked the head of a thick \nstick, and from time to time took it out of his mouth, to see how \nit was getting on.  A fourth did nothing but whistle.  A fifth did \nnothing but spit.  And indeed all these gentlemen were so very \npersevering and energetic in this latter particular, and bestowed \ntheir favours so abundantly upon the carpet, that I take it for \ngranted the Presidential housemaids have high wages, or, to speak \nmore genteelly, an ample amount of \'compensation:\' which is the \nAmerican word for salary, in the case of all public servants.\n\nWe had not waited in this room many minutes, before the black \nmessenger returned, and conducted us into another of smaller \ndimensions, where, at a business-like table covered with papers, \nsat the President himself.  He looked somewhat worn and anxious, \nand well he might; being at war with everybody - but the expression \nof his face was mild and pleasant, and his manner was remarkably \nunaffected, gentlemanly, and agreeable.  I thought that in his \nwhole carriage and demeanour, he became his station singularly \nwell.\n\nBeing advised that the sensible etiquette of the republican court \nadmitted of a traveller, like myself, declining, without any \nimpropriety, an invitation to dinner, which did not reach me until \nI had concluded my arrangements for leaving Washington some days \nbefore that to which it referred, I only returned to this house \nonce.  It was on the occasion of one of those general assemblies \nwhich are held on certain nights, between the hours of nine and \ntwelve o\'clock, and are called, rather oddly, Levees.\n\nI went, with my wife, at about ten.  There was a pretty dense crowd \nof carriages and people in the court-yard, and so far as I could \nmake out, there were no very clear regulations for the taking up or \nsetting down of company.  There were certainly no policemen to \nsoothe startled horses, either by sawing at their bridles or \nflourishing truncheons in their eyes; and I am ready to make oath \nthat no inoffensive persons were knocked violently on the head, or \npoked acutely in their backs or stomachs; or brought to a \nstandstill by any such gentle means, and then taken into custody \nfor not moving on.  But there was no confusion or disorder.  Our \ncarriage reached the porch in its turn, without any blustering, \nswearing, shouting, backing, or other disturbance:  and we \ndismounted with as much ease and comfort as though we had been \nescorted by the whole Metropolitan Force from A to Z inclusive.\n\nThe suite of rooms on the ground-floor were lighted up, and a \nmilitary band was playing in the hall.  In the smaller drawing-\nroom, the centre of a circle of company, were the President and his \ndaughter-in-law, who acted as the lady of the mansion; and a very \ninteresting, graceful, and accomplished lady too.  One gentleman \nwho stood among this group, appeared to take upon himself the \nfunctions of a master of the ceremonies.  I saw no other officers \nor attendants, and none were needed.\n\nThe great drawing-room, which I have already mentioned, and the \nother chambers on the ground-floor, were crowded to excess.  The \ncompany was not, in our sense of the term, select, for it \ncomprehended persons of very many grades and classes; nor was there \nany great display of costly attire:  indeed, some of the costumes \nmay have been, for aught I know, grotesque enough.  But the decorum \nand propriety of behaviour which prevailed, were unbroken by any \nrude or disagreeable incident; and every man, even among the \nmiscellaneous crowd in the hall who were admitted without any \norders or tickets to look on, appeared to feel that he was a part \nof the Institution, and was responsible for its preserving a \nbecoming character, and appearing to the best advantage.\n\nThat these visitors, too, whatever their station, were not without \nsome refinement of taste and appreciation of intellectual gifts, \nand gratitude to those men who, by the peaceful exercise of great \nabilities, shed new charms and associations upon the homes of their \ncountrymen, and elevate their character in other lands, was most \nearnestly testified by their reception of Washington Irving, my \ndear friend, who had recently been appointed Minister at the court \nof Spain, and who was among them that night, in his new character, \nfor the first and last time before going abroad.  I sincerely \nbelieve that in all the madness of American politics, few public \nmen would have been so earnestly, devotedly, and affectionately \ncaressed, as this most charming writer:  and I have seldom \nrespected a public assembly more, than I did this eager throng, \nwhen I saw them turning with one mind from noisy orators and \nofficers of state, and flocking with a generous and honest impulse \nround the man of quiet pursuits:  proud in his promotion as \nreflecting back upon their country:  and grateful to him with their \nwhole hearts for the store of graceful fancies he had poured out \namong them.  Long may he dispense such treasures with unsparing \nhand; and long may they remember him as worthily!\n\n* * * * * *\n\nThe term we had assigned for the duration of our stay in Washington \nwas now at an end, and we were to begin to travel; for the railroad \ndistances we had traversed yet, in journeying among these older \ntowns, are on that great continent looked upon as nothing.\n\nI had at first intended going South - to Charleston.  But when I \ncame to consider the length of time which this journey would \noccupy, and the premature heat of the season, which even at \nWashington had been often very trying; and weighed moreover, in my \nown mind, the pain of living in the constant contemplation of \nslavery, against the more than doubtful chances of my ever seeing \nit, in the time I had to spare, stripped of the disguises in which \nit would certainly be dressed, and so adding any item to the host \nof facts already heaped together on the subject; I began to listen \nto old whisperings which had often been present to me at home in \nEngland, when I little thought of ever being here; and to dream \nagain of cities growing up, like palaces in fairy tales, among the \nwilds and forests of the west.\n\nThe advice I received in most quarters when I began to yield to my \ndesire of travelling towards that point of the compass was, \naccording to custom, sufficiently cheerless:  my companion being \nthreatened with more perils, dangers, and discomforts, than I can \nremember or would catalogue if I could; but of which it will be \nsufficient to remark that blowings-up in steamboats and breakings-\ndown in coaches were among the least.  But, having a western route \nsketched out for me by the best and kindest authority to which I \ncould have resorted, and putting no great faith in these \ndiscouragements, I soon determined on my plan of action.\n\nThis was to travel south, only to Richmond in Virginia; and then to \nturn, and shape our course for the Far West; whither I beseech the \nreader\'s company, in a new chapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX - A NIGHT STEAMER ON THE POTOMAC RIVER.  VIRGINIA ROAD, \nAND A BLACK DRIVER.  RICHMOND.  BALTIMORE.  THE HARRISBURG MAIL, \nAND A GLIMPSE OF THE CITY.  A CANAL BOAT\n\n\n\nWE were to proceed in the first instance by steamboat; and as it is \nusual to sleep on board, in consequence of the starting-hour being \nfour o\'clock in the morning, we went down to where she lay, at that \nvery uncomfortable time for such expeditions when slippers are most \nvaluable, and a familiar bed, in the perspective of an hour or two, \nlooks uncommonly pleasant.\n\nIt is ten o\'clock at night:  say half-past ten:  moonlight, warm, \nand dull enough.  The steamer (not unlike a child\'s Noah\'s ark in \nform, with the machinery on the top of the roof) is riding lazily \nup and down, and bumping clumsily against the wooden pier, as the \nripple of the river trifles with its unwieldy carcase.  The wharf \nis some distance from the city.  There is nobody down here; and one \nor two dull lamps upon the steamer\'s decks are the only signs of \nlife remaining, when our coach has driven away.  As soon as our \nfootsteps are heard upon the planks, a fat negress, particularly \nfavoured by nature in respect of bustle, emerges from some dark \nstairs, and marshals my wife towards the ladies\' cabin, to which \nretreat she goes, followed by a mighty bale of cloaks and great-\ncoats.  I valiantly resolve not to go to bed at all, but to walk up \nand down the pier till morning.\n\nI begin my promenade - thinking of all kinds of distant things and \npersons, and of nothing near - and pace up and down for half-an-\nhour.  Then I go on board again; and getting into the light of one \nof the lamps, look at my watch and think it must have stopped; and \nwonder what has become of the faithful secretary whom I brought \nalong with me from Boston.  He is supping with our late landlord (a \nField Marshal, at least, no doubt) in honour of our departure, and \nmay be two hours longer.  I walk again, but it gets duller and \nduller:  the moon goes down:  next June seems farther off in the \ndark, and the echoes of my footsteps make me nervous.  It has \nturned cold too; and walking up and down without my companion in \nsuch lonely circumstances, is but poor amusement.  So I break my \nstaunch resolution, and think it may be, perhaps, as well to go to \nbed.\n\nI go on board again; open the door of the gentlemen\'s cabin and \nwalk in.  Somehow or other - from its being so quiet, I suppose - I \nhave taken it into my head that there is nobody there.  To my \nhorror and amazement it is full of sleepers in every stage, shape, \nattitude, and variety of slumber:  in the berths, on the chairs, on \nthe floors, on the tables, and particularly round the stove, my \ndetested enemy.  I take another step forward, and slip on the \nshining face of a black steward, who lies rolled in a blanket on \nthe floor.  He jumps up, grins, half in pain and half in \nhospitality; whispers my own name in my ear; and groping among the \nsleepers, leads me to my berth.  Standing beside it, I count these \nslumbering passengers, and get past forty.  There is no use in \ngoing further, so I begin to undress.  As the chairs are all \noccupied, and there is nothing else to put my clothes on, I deposit \nthem upon the ground:  not without soiling my hands, for it is in \nthe same condition as the carpets in the Capitol, and from the same \ncause.  Having but partially undressed, I clamber on my shelf, and \nhold the curtain open for a few minutes while I look round on all \nmy fellow-travellers again.  That done, I let it fall on them, and \non the world:  turn round:  and go to sleep.\n\nI wake, of course, when we get under weigh, for there is a good \ndeal of noise.  The day is then just breaking.  Everybody wakes at \nthe same time.  Some are self-possessed directly, and some are much \nperplexed to make out where they are until they have rubbed their \neyes, and leaning on one elbow, looked about them.  Some yawn, some \ngroan, nearly all spit, and a few get up.  I am among the risers:  \nfor it is easy to feel, without going into the fresh air, that the \natmosphere of the cabin is vile in the last degree.  I huddle on my \nclothes, go down into the fore-cabin, get shaved by the barber, and \nwash myself.  The washing and dressing apparatus for the passengers \ngenerally, consists of two jack-towels, three small wooden basins, \na keg of water and a ladle to serve it out with, six square inches \nof looking-glass, two ditto ditto of yellow soap, a comb and brush \nfor the head, and nothing for the teeth.  Everybody uses the comb \nand brush, except myself.  Everybody stares to see me using my own; \nand two or three gentlemen are strongly disposed to banter me on my \nprejudices, but don\'t.  When I have made my toilet, I go upon the \nhurricane-deck, and set in for two hours of hard walking up and \ndown.  The sun is rising brilliantly; we are passing Mount Vernon, \nwhere Washington lies buried; the river is wide and rapid; and its \nbanks are beautiful.  All the glory and splendour of the day are \ncoming on, and growing brighter every minute.\n\nAt eight o\'clock, we breakfast in the cabin where I passed the \nnight, but the windows and doors are all thrown open, and now it is \nfresh enough.  There is no hurry or greediness apparent in the \ndespatch of the meal.  It is longer than a travelling breakfast \nwith us; more orderly, and more polite.\n\nSoon after nine o\'clock we come to Potomac Creek, where we are to \nland; and then comes the oddest part of the journey.  Seven stage-\ncoaches are preparing to carry us on.  Some of them are ready, some \nof them are not ready.  Some of the drivers are blacks, some \nwhites.  There are four horses to each coach, and all the horses, \nharnessed or unharnessed, are there.  The passengers are getting \nout of the steamboat, and into the coaches; the luggage is being \ntransferred in noisy wheelbarrows; the horses are frightened, and \nimpatient to start; the black drivers are chattering to them like \nso many monkeys; and the white ones whooping like so many drovers:  \nfor the main thing to be done in all kinds of hostlering here, is \nto make as much noise as possible.  The coaches are something like \nthe French coaches, but not nearly so good.  In lieu of springs, \nthey are hung on bands of the strongest leather.  There is very \nlittle choice or difference between them; and they may be likened \nto the car portion of the swings at an English fair, roofed, put \nupon axle-trees and wheels, and curtained with painted canvas.  \nThey are covered with mud from the roof to the wheel-tire, and have \nnever been cleaned since they were first built.\n\nThe tickets we have received on board the steamboat are marked No. \n1, so we belong to coach No. 1.  I throw my coat on the box, and \nhoist my wife and her maid into the inside.  It has only one step, \nand that being about a yard from the ground, is usually approached \nby a chair:  when there is no chair, ladies trust in Providence.  \nThe coach holds nine inside, having a seat across from door to \ndoor, where we in England put our legs:  so that there is only one \nfeat more difficult in the performance than getting in, and that \nis, getting out again.  There is only one outside passenger, and he \nsits upon the box.  As I am that one, I climb up; and while they \nare strapping the luggage on the roof, and heaping it into a kind \nof tray behind, have a good opportunity of looking at the driver.\n\nHe is a negro - very black indeed.  He is dressed in a coarse \npepper-and-salt suit excessively patched and darned (particularly \nat the knees), grey stockings, enormous unblacked high-low shoes, \nand very short trousers.  He has two odd gloves:  one of parti-\ncoloured worsted, and one of leather.  He has a very short whip, \nbroken in the middle and bandaged up with string.  And yet he wears \na low-crowned, broad-brimmed, black hat:  faintly shadowing forth a \nkind of insane imitation of an English coachman!  But somebody in \nauthority cries \'Go ahead!\' as I am making these observations.  The \nmail takes the lead in a four-horse waggon, and all the coaches \nfollow in procession:  headed by No. 1.\n\nBy the way, whenever an Englishman would cry \'All right!\' an \nAmerican cries \'Go ahead!\' which is somewhat expressive of the \nnational character of the two countries.\n\nThe first half-mile of the road is over bridges made of loose \nplanks laid across two parallel poles, which tilt up as the wheels \nroll over them; and IN the river.  The river has a clayey bottom \nand is full of holes, so that half a horse is constantly \ndisappearing unexpectedly, and can\'t be found again for some time.\n\nBut we get past even this, and come to the road itself, which is a \nseries of alternate swamps and gravel-pits.  A tremendous place is \nclose before us, the black driver rolls his eyes, screws his mouth \nup very round, and looks straight between the two leaders, as if he \nwere saying to himself, \'We have done this often before, but NOW I \nthink we shall have a crash.\'  He takes a rein in each hand; jerks \nand pulls at both; and dances on the splashboard with both feet \n(keeping his seat, of course) like the late lamented Ducrow on two \nof his fiery coursers.  We come to the spot, sink down in the mire \nnearly to the coach windows, tilt on one side at an angle of forty-\nfive degrees, and stick there.  The insides scream dismally; the \ncoach stops; the horses flounder; all the other six coaches stop; \nand their four-and-twenty horses flounder likewise:  but merely for \ncompany, and in sympathy with ours.  Then the following \ncircumstances occur.\n\nBLACK DRIVER (to the horses).  \'Hi!\'\n\nNothing happens.  Insides scream again.\n\nBLACK DRIVER (to the horses).  \'Ho!\'\n\nHorses plunge, and splash the black driver.\n\nGENTLEMAN INSIDE (looking out).  \'Why, what on airth -\n\nGentleman receives a variety of splashes and draws his head in \nagain, without finishing his question or waiting for an answer.\n\nBLACK DRIVER (still to the horses).  \'Jiddy!  Jiddy!\'\n\nHorses pull violently, drag the coach out of the hole, and draw it \nup a bank; so steep, that the black driver\'s legs fly up into the \nair, and he goes back among the luggage on the roof.  But he \nimmediately recovers himself, and cries (still to the horses),\n\n\'Pill!\'\n\nNo effect.  On the contrary, the coach begins to roll back upon No. \n2, which rolls back upon No. 3, which rolls back upon No. 4, and so \non, until No. 7 is heard to curse and swear, nearly a quarter of a \nmile behind.\n\nBLACK DRIVER (louder than before).  \'Pill!\'\n\nHorses make another struggle to get up the bank, and again the \ncoach rolls backward.\n\nBLACK DRIVER (louder than before).  \'Pe-e-e-ill!\'\n\nHorses make a desperate struggle.\n\nBLACK DRIVER (recovering spirits).  \'Hi, Jiddy, Jiddy, Pill!\'\n\nHorses make another effort.\n\nBLACK DRIVER (with great vigour).  \'Ally Loo!  Hi.  Jiddy, Jiddy.  \nPill.  Ally Loo!\'\n\nHorses almost do it.\n\nBLACK DRIVER (with his eyes starting out of his head).  \'Lee, den.  \nLee, dere.  Hi.  Jiddy, Jiddy.  Pill.  Ally Loo.  Lee-e-e-e-e!\'\n\nThey run up the bank, and go down again on the other side at a \nfearful pace.  It is impossible to stop them, and at the bottom \nthere is a deep hollow, full of water.  The coach rolls \nfrightfully.  The insides scream.  The mud and water fly about us.  \nThe black driver dances like a madman.  Suddenly we are all right \nby some extraordinary means, and stop to breathe.\n\nA black friend of the black driver is sitting on a fence.  The \nblack driver recognises him by twirling his head round and round \nlike a harlequin, rolling his eyes, shrugging his shoulders, and \ngrinning from ear to ear.  He stops short, turns to me, and says:\n\n\'We shall get you through sa, like a fiddle, and hope a please you \nwhen we get you through sa.  Old \'ooman at home sa:\' chuckling very \nmuch.  \'Outside gentleman sa, he often remember old \'ooman at home \nsa,\' grinning again.\n\n\'Ay ay, we\'ll take care of the old woman.  Don\'t be afraid.\'\n\nThe black driver grins again, but there is another hole, and beyond \nthat, another bank, close before us.  So he stops short:  cries (to \nthe horses again) \'Easy.  Easy den.  Ease.  Steady.  Hi.  Jiddy.  \nPill.  Ally.  Loo,\' but never \'Lee!\' until we are reduced to the \nvery last extremity, and are in the midst of difficulties, \nextrication from which appears to be all but impossible.\n\nAnd so we do the ten miles or thereabouts in two hours and a half; \nbreaking no bones, though bruising a great many; and in short \ngetting through the distance, \'like a fiddle.\'\n\nThis singular kind of coaching terminates at Fredericksburgh, \nwhence there is a railway to Richmond.  The tract of country \nthrough which it takes its course was once productive; but the soil \nhas been exhausted by the system of employing a great amount of \nslave labour in forcing crops, without strengthening the land:  and \nit is now little better than a sandy desert overgrown with trees.  \nDreary and uninteresting as its aspect is, I was glad to the heart \nto find anything on which one of the curses of this horrible \ninstitution has fallen; and had greater pleasure in contemplating \nthe withered ground, than the richest and most thriving cultivation \nin the same place could possibly have afforded me.\n\nIn this district, as in all others where slavery sits brooding, (I \nhave frequently heard this admitted, even by those who are its \nwarmest advocates:) there is an air of ruin and decay abroad, which \nis inseparable from the system.  The barns and outhouses are \nmouldering away; the sheds are patched and half roofless; the log \ncabins (built in Virginia with external chimneys made of clay or \nwood) are squalid in the last degree.  There is no look of decent \ncomfort anywhere.  The miserable stations by the railway side, the \ngreat wild wood-yards, whence the engine is supplied with fuel; the \nnegro children rolling on the ground before the cabin doors, with \ndogs and pigs; the biped beasts of burden slinking past:  gloom and \ndejection are upon them all.\n\nIn the negro car belonging to the train in which we made this \njourney, were a mother and her children who had just been \npurchased; the husband and father being left behind with their old \nowner.  The children cried the whole way, and the mother was \nmisery\'s picture.  The champion of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit \nof Happiness, who had bought them, rode in the same train; and, \nevery time we stopped, got down to see that they were safe.  The \nblack in Sinbad\'s Travels with one eye in the middle of his \nforehead which shone like a burning coal, was nature\'s aristocrat \ncompared with this white gentleman.\n\nIt was between six and seven o\'clock in the evening, when we drove \nto the hotel:  in front of which, and on the top of the broad \nflight of steps leading to the door, two or three citizens were \nbalancing themselves on rocking-chairs, and smoking cigars.  We \nfound it a very large and elegant establishment, and were as well \nentertained as travellers need desire to be.  The climate being a \nthirsty one, there was never, at any hour of the day, a scarcity of \nloungers in the spacious bar, or a cessation of the mixing of cool \nliquors:  but they were a merrier people here, and had musical \ninstruments playing to them o\' nights, which it was a treat to hear \nagain.\n\nThe next day, and the next, we rode and walked about the town, \nwhich is delightfully situated on eight hills, overhanging James \nRiver; a sparkling stream, studded here and there with bright \nislands, or brawling over broken rocks.  Although it was yet but \nthe middle of March, the weather in this southern temperature was \nextremely warm; the peech-trees and magnolias were in full bloom; \nand the trees were green.  In a low ground among the hills, is a \nvalley known as \'Bloody Run,\' from a terrible conflict with the \nIndians which once occurred there.  It is a good place for such a \nstruggle, and, like every other spot I saw associated with any \nlegend of that wild people now so rapidly fading from the earth, \ninterested me very much.\n\nThe city is the seat of the local parliament of Virginia; and in \nits shady legislative halls, some orators were drowsily holding \nforth to the hot noon day.  By dint of constant repetition, \nhowever, these constitutional sights had very little more interest \nfor me than so many parochial vestries; and I was glad to exchange \nthis one for a lounge in a well-arranged public library of some ten \nthousand volumes, and a visit to a tobacco manufactory, where the \nworkmen are all slaves.\n\nI saw in this place the whole process of picking, rolling, \npressing, drying, packing in casks, and branding.  All the tobacco \nthus dealt with, was in course of manufacture for chewing; and one \nwould have supposed there was enough in that one storehouse to have \nfilled even the comprehensive jaws of America.  In this form, the \nweed looks like the oil-cake on which we fatten cattle; and even \nwithout reference to its consequences, is sufficiently uninviting.\n\nMany of the workmen appeared to be strong men, and it is hardly \nnecessary to add that they were all labouring quietly, then.  After \ntwo o\'clock in the day, they are allowed to sing, a certain number \nat a time.  The hour striking while I was there, some twenty sang a \nhymn in parts, and sang it by no means ill; pursuing their work \nmeanwhile.  A bell rang as I was about to leave, and they all \npoured forth into a building on the opposite side of the street to \ndinner.  I said several times that I should like to see them at \ntheir meal; but as the gentleman to whom I mentioned this desire \nappeared to be suddenly taken rather deaf, I did not pursue the \nrequest.  Of their appearance I shall have something to say, \npresently.\n\nOn the following day, I visited a plantation or farm, of about \ntwelve hundred acres, on the opposite bank of the river.  Here \nagain, although I went down with the owner of the estate, to \'the \nquarter,\' as that part of it in which the slaves live is called, I \nwas not invited to enter into any of their huts.  All I saw of \nthem, was, that they were very crazy, wretched cabins, near to \nwhich groups of half-naked children basked in the sun, or wallowed \non the dusty ground.  But I believe that this gentleman is a \nconsiderate and excellent master, who inherited his fifty slaves, \nand is neither a buyer nor a seller of human stock; and I am sure, \nfrom my own observation and conviction, that he is a kind-hearted, \nworthy man.\n\nThe planter\'s house was an airy, rustic dwelling, that brought \nDefoe\'s description of such places strongly to my recollection.  \nThe day was very warm, but the blinds being all closed, and the \nwindows and doors set wide open, a shady coolness rustled through \nthe rooms, which was exquisitely refreshing after the glare and \nheat without.  Before the windows was an open piazza, where, in \nwhat they call the hot weather - whatever that may be - they sling \nhammocks, and drink and doze luxuriously.  I do not know how their \ncool rejections may taste within the hammocks, but, having \nexperience, I can report that, out of them, the mounds of ices and \nthe bowls of mint-julep and sherry-cobbler they make in these \nlatitudes, are refreshments never to be thought of afterwards, in \nsummer, by those who would preserve contented minds.\n\nThere are two bridges across the river:  one belongs to the \nrailroad, and the other, which is a very crazy affair, is the \nprivate property of some old lady in the neighbourhood, who levies \ntolls upon the townspeople.  Crossing this bridge, on my way back, \nI saw a notice painted on the gate, cautioning all persons to drive \nslowly:  under a penalty, if the offender were a white man, of five \ndollars; if a negro, fifteen stripes.\n\nThe same decay and gloom that overhang the way by which it is \napproached, hover above the town of Richmond.  There are pretty \nvillas and cheerful houses in its streets, and Nature smiles upon \nthe country round; but jostling its handsome residences, like \nslavery itself going hand in hand with many lofty virtues, are \ndeplorable tenements, fences unrepaired, walls crumbling into \nruinous heaps.  Hinting gloomily at things below the surface, \nthese, and many other tokens of the same description, force \nthemselves upon the notice, and are remembered with depressing \ninfluence, when livelier features are forgotten.\n\nTo those who are happily unaccustomed to them, the countenances in \nthe streets and labouring-places, too, are shocking.  All men who \nknow that there are laws against instructing slaves, of which the \npains and penalties greatly exceed in their amount the fines \nimposed on those who maim and torture them, must be prepared to \nfind their faces very low in the scale of intellectual expression.  \nBut the darkness - not of skin, but mind - which meets the \nstranger\'s eye at every turn; the brutalizing and blotting out of \nall fairer characters traced by Nature\'s hand; immeasurably outdo \nhis worst belief.  That travelled creation of the great satirist\'s \nbrain, who fresh from living among horses, peered from a high \ncasement down upon his own kind with trembling horror, was scarcely \nmore repelled and daunted by the sight, than those who look upon \nsome of these faces for the first time must surely be.\n\nI left the last of them behind me in the person of a wretched \ndrudge, who, after running to and fro all day till midnight, and \nmoping in his stealthy winks of sleep upon the stairs \nbetweenwhiles, was washing the dark passages at four o\'clock in the \nmorning; and went upon my way with a grateful heart that I was not \ndoomed to live where slavery was, and had never had my senses \nblunted to its wrongs and horrors in a slave-rocked cradle.\n\nIt had been my intention to proceed by James River and Chesapeake \nBay to Baltimore; but one of the steamboats being absent from her \nstation through some accident, and the means of conveyance being \nconsequently rendered uncertain, we returned to Washington by the \nway we had come (there were two constables on board the steamboat, \nin pursuit of runaway slaves), and halting there again for one \nnight, went on to Baltimore next afternoon.\n\nThe most comfortable of all the hotels of which I had any \nexperience in the United States, and they were not a few, is \nBarnum\'s, in that city:  where the English traveller will find \ncurtains to his bed, for the first and probably the last time in \nAmerica (this is a disinterested remark, for I never use them); and \nwhere he will be likely to have enough water for washing himself, \nwhich is not at all a common case.\n\nThis capital of the state of Maryland is a bustling, busy town, \nwith a great deal of traffic of various kinds, and in particular of \nwater commerce.  That portion of the town which it most favours is \nnone of the cleanest, it is true; but the upper part is of a very \ndifferent character, and has many agreeable streets and public \nbuildings.  The Washington Monument, which is a handsome pillar \nwith a statue on its summit; the Medical College; and the Battle \nMonument in memory of an engagement with the British at North \nPoint; are the most conspicuous among them.\n\nThere is a very good prison in this city, and the State \nPenitentiary is also among its institutions.  In this latter \nestablishment there were two curious cases.\n\nOne was that of a young man, who had been tried for the murder of \nhis father.  The evidence was entirely circumstantial, and was very \nconflicting and doubtful; nor was it possible to assign any motive \nwhich could have tempted him to the commission of so tremendous a \ncrime.  He had been tried twice; and on the second occasion the \njury felt so much hesitation in convicting him, that they found a \nverdict of manslaughter, or murder in the second degree; which it \ncould not possibly be, as there had, beyond all doubt, been no \nquarrel or provocation, and if he were guilty at all, he was \nunquestionably guilty of murder in its broadest and worst \nsignification.\n\nThe remarkable feature in the case was, that if the unfortunate \ndeceased were not really murdered by this own son of his, he must \nhave been murdered by his own brother.  The evidence lay in a most \nremarkable manner, between those two.  On all the suspicious \npoints, the dead man\'s brother was the witness:  all the \nexplanations for the prisoner (some of them extremely plausible) \nwent, by construction and inference, to inculcate him as plotting \nto fix the guilt upon his nephew.  It must have been one of them:  \nand the jury had to decide between two sets of suspicions, almost \nequally unnatural, unaccountable, and strange.\n\nThe other case, was that of a man who once went to a certain \ndistiller\'s and stole a copper measure containing a quantity of \nliquor.  He was pursued and taken with the property in his \npossession, and was sentenced to two years\' imprisonment.  On \ncoming out of the jail, at the expiration of that term, he went \nback to the same distiller\'s, and stole the same copper measure \ncontaining the same quantity of liquor.  There was not the \nslightest reason to suppose that the man wished to return to \nprison:  indeed everything, but the commission of the offence, made \ndirectly against that assumption.  There are only two ways of \naccounting for this extraordinary proceeding.  One is, that after \nundergoing so much for this copper measure he conceived he had \nestablished a sort of claim and right to it.  The other that, by \ndint of long thinking about, it had become a monomania with him, \nand had acquired a fascination which he found it impossible to \nresist; swelling from an Earthly Copper Gallon into an Ethereal \nGolden Vat.\n\nAfter remaining here a couple of days I bound myself to a rigid \nadherence to the plan I had laid down so recently, and resolved to \nset forward on our western journey without any more delay.  \nAccordingly, having reduced the luggage within the smallest \npossible compass (by sending back to New York, to be afterwards \nforwarded to us in Canada, so much of it as was not absolutely \nwanted); and having procured the necessary credentials to banking-\nhouses on the way; and having moreover looked for two evenings at \nthe setting sun, with as well-defined an idea of the country before \nus as if we had been going to travel into the very centre of that \nplanet; we left Baltimore by another railway at half-past eight in \nthe morning, and reached the town of York, some sixty miles off, by \nthe early dinner-time of the Hotel which was the starting-place of \nthe four-horse coach, wherein we were to proceed to Harrisburg.\n\nThis conveyance, the box of which I was fortunate enough to secure, \nhad come down to meet us at the railroad station, and was as muddy \nand cumbersome as usual.  As more passengers were waiting for us at \nthe inn-door, the coachman observed under his breath, in the usual \nself-communicative voice, looking the while at his mouldy harness \nas if it were to that he was addressing himself,\n\n\'I expect we shall want THE BIG coach.\'\n\nI could not help wondering within myself what the size of this big \ncoach might be, and how many persons it might be designed to hold; \nfor the vehicle which was too small for our purpose was something \nlarger than two English heavy night coaches, and might have been \nthe twin-brother of a French Diligence.  My speculations were \nspeedily set at rest, however, for as soon as we had dined, there \ncame rumbling up the street, shaking its sides like a corpulent \ngiant, a kind of barge on wheels.  After much blundering and \nbacking, it stopped at the door:  rolling heavily from side to side \nwhen its other motion had ceased, as if it had taken cold in its \ndamp stable, and between that, and the having been required in its \ndropsical old age to move at any faster pace than a walk, were \ndistressed by shortness of wind.\n\n\'If here ain\'t the Harrisburg mail at last, and dreadful bright and \nsmart to look at too,\' cried an elderly gentleman in some \nexcitement, \'darn my mother!\'\n\nI don\'t know what the sensation of being darned may be, or whether \na man\'s mother has a keener relish or disrelish of the process than \nanybody else; but if the endurance of this mysterious ceremony by \nthe old lady in question had depended on the accuracy of her son\'s \nvision in respect to the abstract brightness and smartness of the \nHarrisburg mail, she would certainly have undergone its infliction.  \nHowever, they booked twelve people inside; and the luggage \n(including such trifles as a large rocking-chair, and a good-sized \ndining-table) being at length made fast upon the roof, we started \noff in great state.\n\nAt the door of another hotel, there was another passenger to be \ntaken up.\n\n\'Any room, sir?\' cries the new passenger to the coachman.\n\n\'Well, there\'s room enough,\' replies the coachman, without getting \ndown, or even looking at him.\n\n\'There an\'t no room at all, sir,\' bawls a gentleman inside.  Which \nanother gentleman (also inside) confirms, by predicting that the \nattempt to introduce any more passengers \'won\'t fit nohow.\'\n\nThe new passenger, without any expression of anxiety, looks into \nthe coach, and then looks up at the coachman:  \'Now, how do you \nmean to fix it?\' says he, after a pause:  \'for I MUST go.\'\n\nThe coachman employs himself in twisting the lash of his whip into \na knot, and takes no more notice of the question:  clearly \nsignifying that it is anybody\'s business but his, and that the \npassengers would do well to fix it, among themselves.  In this \nstate of things, matters seem to be approximating to a fix of \nanother kind, when another inside passenger in a corner, who is \nnearly suffocated, cries faintly, \'I\'ll get out.\'\n\nThis is no matter of relief or self-congratulation to the driver, \nfor his immovable philosophy is perfectly undisturbed by anything \nthat happens in the coach.  Of all things in the world, the coach \nwould seem to be the very last upon his mind.  The exchange is \nmade, however, and then the passenger who has given up his seat \nmakes a third upon the box, seating himself in what he calls the \nmiddle; that is, with half his person on my legs, and the other \nhalf on the driver\'s.\n\n\'Go a-head, cap\'en,\' cries the colonel, who directs.\n\n\'Go-lang!\' cries the cap\'en to his company, the horses, and away we \ngo.\n\nWe took up at a rural bar-room, after we had gone a few miles, an \nintoxicated gentleman who climbed upon the roof among the luggage, \nand subsequently slipping off without hurting himself, was seen in \nthe distant perspective reeling back to the grog-shop where we had \nfound him.  We also parted with more of our freight at different \ntimes, so that when we came to change horses, I was again alone \noutside.\n\nThe coachmen always change with the horses, and are usually as \ndirty as the coach.  The first was dressed like a very shabby \nEnglish baker; the second like a Russian peasant:  for he wore a \nloose purple camlet robe, with a fur collar, tied round his waist \nwith a parti-coloured worsted sash; grey trousers; light blue \ngloves:  and a cap of bearskin.  It had by this time come on to \nrain very heavily, and there was a cold damp mist besides, which \npenetrated to the skin.  I was glad to take advantage of a stoppage \nand get down to stretch my legs, shake the water off my great-coat, \nand swallow the usual anti-temperance recipe for keeping out the \ncold.\n\nWhen I mounted to my seat again, I observed a new parcel lying on \nthe coach roof, which I took to be a rather large fiddle in a brown \nbag.  In the course of a few miles, however, I discovered that it \nhad a glazed cap at one end and a pair of muddy shoes at the other \nand further observation demonstrated it to be a small boy in a \nsnuff-coloured coat, with his arms quite pinioned to his sides, by \ndeep forcing into his pockets.  He was, I presume, a relative or \nfriend of the coachman\'s, as he lay a-top of the luggage with his \nface towards the rain; and except when a change of position brought \nhis shoes in contact with my hat, he appeared to be asleep.  At \nlast, on some occasion of our stopping, this thing slowly upreared \nitself to the height of three feet six, and fixing its eyes on me, \nobserved in piping accents, with a complaisant yawn, half quenched \nin an obliging air of friendly patronage, \'Well now, stranger, I \nguess you find this a\'most like an English arternoon, hey?\'\n\nThe scenery, which had been tame enough at first, was, for the last \nten or twelve miles, beautiful.  Our road wound through the \npleasant valley of the Susquehanna; the river, dotted with \ninnumerable green islands, lay upon our right; and on the left, a \nsteep ascent, craggy with broken rock, and dark with pine trees.  \nThe mist, wreathing itself into a hundred fantastic shapes, moved \nsolemnly upon the water; and the gloom of evening gave to all an \nair of mystery and silence which greatly enhanced its natural \ninterest.\n\nWe crossed this river by a wooden bridge, roofed and covered in on \nall sides, and nearly a mile in length.  It was profoundly dark; \nperplexed, with great beams, crossing and recrossing it at every \npossible angle; and through the broad chinks and crevices in the \nfloor, the rapid river gleamed, far down below, like a legion of \neyes.  We had no lamps; and as the horses stumbled and floundered \nthrough this place, towards the distant speck of dying light, it \nseemed interminable.  I really could not at first persuade myself \nas we rumbled heavily on, filling the bridge with hollow noises, \nand I held down my head to save it from the rafters above, but that \nI was in a painful dream; for I have often dreamed of toiling \nthrough such places, and as often argued, even at the time, \'this \ncannot be reality.\'\n\nAt length, however, we emerged upon the streets of Harrisburg, \nwhose feeble lights, reflected dismally from the wet ground, did \nnot shine out upon a very cheerful city.  We were soon established \nin a snug hotel, which though smaller and far less splendid than \nmany we put up at, it raised above them all in my remembrance, by \nhaving for its landlord the most obliging, considerate, and \ngentlemanly person I ever had to deal with.\n\nAs we were not to proceed upon our journey until the afternoon, I \nwalked out, after breakfast the next morning, to look about me; and \nwas duly shown a model prison on the solitary system, just erected, \nand as yet without an inmate; the trunk of an old tree to which \nHarris, the first settler here (afterwards buried under it), was \ntied by hostile Indians, with his funeral pile about him, when he \nwas saved by the timely appearance of a friendly party on the \nopposite shore of the river; the local legislature (for there was \nanother of those bodies here again, in full debate); and the other \ncuriosities of the town.\n\nI was very much interested in looking over a number of treaties \nmade from time to time with the poor Indians, signed by the \ndifferent chiefs at the period of their ratification, and preserved \nin the office of the Secretary to the Commonwealth.  These \nsignatures, traced of course by their own hands, are rough drawings \nof the creatures or weapons they were called after.  Thus, the \nGreat Turtle makes a crooked pen-and-ink outline of a great turtle; \nthe Buffalo sketches a buffalo; the War Hatchet sets a rough image \nof that weapon for his mark.  So with the Arrow, the Fish, the \nScalp, the Big Canoe, and all of them.\n\nI could not but think - as I looked at these feeble and tremulous \nproductions of hands which could draw the longest arrow to the head \nin a stout elk-horn bow, or split a bead or feather with a rifle-\nball - of Crabbe\'s musings over the Parish Register, and the \nirregular scratches made with a pen, by men who would plough a \nlengthy furrow straight from end to end.  Nor could I help \nbestowing many sorrowful thoughts upon the simple warriors whose \nhands and hearts were set there, in all truth and honesty; and who \nonly learned in course of time from white men how to break their \nfaith, and quibble out of forms and bonds.  I wonder, too, how many \ntimes the credulous Big Turtle, or trusting Little Hatchet, had put \nhis mark to treaties which were falsely read to him; and had signed \naway, he knew not what, until it went and cast him loose upon the \nnew possessors of the land, a savage indeed.\n\nOur host announced, before our early dinner, that some members of \nthe legislative body proposed to do us the honour of calling.  He \nhad kindly yielded up to us his wife\'s own little parlour, and when \nI begged that he would show them in, I saw him look with painful \napprehension at its pretty carpet; though, being otherwise occupied \nat the time, the cause of his uneasiness did not occur to me.\n\nIt certainly would have been more pleasant to all parties \nconcerned, and would not, I think, have compromised their \nindependence in any material degree, if some of these gentlemen had \nnot only yielded to the prejudice in favour of spittoons, but had \nabandoned themselves, for the moment, even to the conventional \nabsurdity of pocket-handkerchiefs.\n\nIt still continued to rain heavily, and when we went down to the \nCanal Boat (for that was the mode of conveyance by which we were to \nproceed) after dinner, the weather was as unpromising and \nobstinately wet as one would desire to see.  Nor was the sight of \nthis canal boat, in which we were to spend three or four days, by \nany means a cheerful one; as it involved some uneasy speculations \nconcerning the disposal of the passengers at night, and opened a \nwide field of inquiry touching the other domestic arrangements of \nthe establishment, which was sufficiently disconcerting.\n\nHowever, there it was - a barge with a little house in it, viewed \nfrom the outside; and a caravan at a fair, viewed from within:  the \ngentlemen being accommodated, as the spectators usually are, in one \nof those locomotive museums of penny wonders; and the ladies being \npartitioned off by a red curtain, after the manner of the dwarfs \nand giants in the same establishments, whose private lives are \npassed in rather close exclusiveness.\n\nWe sat here, looking silently at the row of little tables, which \nextended down both sides of the cabin, and listening to the rain as \nit dripped and pattered on the boat, and plashed with a dismal \nmerriment in the water, until the arrival of the railway train, for \nwhose final contribution to our stock of passengers, our departure \nwas alone deferred.  It brought a great many boxes, which were \nbumped and tossed upon the roof, almost as painfully as if they had \nbeen deposited on one\'s own head, without the intervention of a \nporter\'s knot; and several damp gentlemen, whose clothes, on their \ndrawing round the stove, began to steam again.  No doubt it would \nhave been a thought more comfortable if the driving rain, which now \npoured down more soakingly than ever, had admitted of a window \nbeing opened, or if our number had been something less than thirty; \nbut there was scarcely time to think as much, when a train of three \nhorses was attached to the tow-rope, the boy upon the leader \nsmacked his whip, the rudder creaked and groaned complainingly, and \nwe had begun our journey.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X - SOME FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE CANAL BOAT, ITS DOMESTIC \nECONOMY, AND ITS PASSENGERS.  JOURNEY TO PITTSBURG ACROSS THE \nALLEGHANY MOUNTAINS.  PITTSBURG\n\n\n\nAS it continued to rain most perseveringly, we all remained below:  \nthe damp gentlemen round the stove, gradually becoming mildewed by \nthe action of the fire; and the dry gentlemen lying at full length \nupon the seats, or slumbering uneasily with their faces on the \ntables, or walking up and down the cabin, which it was barely \npossible for a man of the middle height to do, without making bald \nplaces on his head by scraping it against the roof.  At about six \no\'clock, all the small tables were put together to form one long \ntable, and everybody sat down to tea, coffee, bread, butter, \nsalmon, shad, liver, steaks, potatoes, pickles, ham, chops, black-\npuddings, and sausages.\n\n\'Will you try,\' said my opposite neighbour, handing me a dish of \npotatoes, broken up in milk and butter, \'will you try some of these \nfixings?\'\n\nThere are few words which perform such various duties as this word \n\'fix.\'  It is the Caleb Quotem of the American vocabulary.  You \ncall upon a gentleman in a country town, and his help informs you \nthat he is \'fixing himself\' just now, but will be down directly:  \nby which you are to understand that he is dressing.  You inquire, \non board a steamboat, of a fellow-passenger, whether breakfast will \nbe ready soon, and he tells you he should think so, for when he was \nlast below, they were \'fixing the tables:\' in other words, laying \nthe cloth.  You beg a porter to collect your luggage, and he \nentreats you not to be uneasy, for he\'ll \'fix it presently:\' and if \nyou complain of indisposition, you are advised to have recourse to \nDoctor So-and-so, who will \'fix you\' in no time.\n\nOne night, I ordered a bottle of mulled wine at an hotel where I \nwas staying, and waited a long time for it; at length it was put \nupon the table with an apology from the landlord that he feared it \nwasn\'t \'fixed properly.\' And I recollect once, at a stage-coach \ndinner, overhearing a very stern gentleman demand of a waiter who \npresented him with a plate of underdone roast-beef, \'whether he \ncalled THAT, fixing God A\'mighty\'s vittles?\'\n\nThere is no doubt that the meal, at which the invitation was \ntendered to me which has occasioned this digression, was disposed \nof somewhat ravenously; and that the gentlemen thrust the broad-\nbladed knives and the two-pronged forks further down their throats \nthan I ever saw the same weapons go before, except in the hands of \na skilful juggler:  but no man sat down until the ladies were \nseated; or omitted any little act of politeness which could \ncontribute to their comfort.  Nor did I ever once, on any occasion, \nanywhere, during my rambles in America, see a woman exposed to the \nslightest act of rudeness, incivility, or even inattention.\n\nBy the time the meal was over, the rain, which seemed to have worn \nitself out by coming down so fast, was nearly over too; and it \nbecame feasible to go on deck:  which was a great relief, \nnotwithstanding its being a very small deck, and being rendered \nstill smaller by the luggage, which was heaped together in the \nmiddle under a tarpaulin covering; leaving, on either side, a path \nso narrow, that it became a science to walk to and fro without \ntumbling overboard into the canal.  It was somewhat embarrassing at \nfirst, too, to have to duck nimbly every five minutes whenever the \nman at the helm cried \'Bridge!\' and sometimes, when the cry was \n\'Low Bridge,\' to lie down nearly flat.  But custom familiarises one \nto anything, and there were so many bridges that it took a very \nshort time to get used to this.\n\nAs night came on, and we drew in sight of the first range of hills, \nwhich are the outposts of the Alleghany Mountains, the scenery, \nwhich had been uninteresting hitherto, became more bold and \nstriking.  The wet ground reeked and smoked, after the heavy fall \nof rain, and the croaking of the frogs (whose noise in these parts \nis almost incredible) sounded as though a million of fairy teams \nwith bells were travelling through the air, and keeping pace with \nus.  The night was cloudy yet, but moonlight too:  and when we \ncrossed the Susquehanna river - over which there is an \nextraordinary wooden bridge with two galleries, one above the \nother, so that even there, two boat teams meeting, may pass without \nconfusion - it was wild and grand.\n\nI have mentioned my having been in some uncertainty and doubt, at \nfirst, relative to the sleeping arrangements on board this boat.  I \nremained in the same vague state of mind until ten o\'clock or \nthereabouts, when going below, I found suspended on either side of \nthe cabin, three long tiers of hanging bookshelves, designed \napparently for volumes of the small octavo size.  Looking with \ngreater attention at these contrivances (wondering to find such \nliterary preparations in such a place), I descried on each shelf a \nsort of microscopic sheet and blanket; then I began dimly to \ncomprehend that the passengers were the library, and that they were \nto be arranged, edge-wise, on these shelves, till morning.\n\nI was assisted to this conclusion by seeing some of them gathered \nround the master of the boat, at one of the tables, drawing lots \nwith all the anxieties and passions of gamesters depicted in their \ncountenances; while others, with small pieces of cardboard in their \nhands, were groping among the shelves in search of numbers \ncorresponding with those they had drawn.  As soon as any gentleman \nfound his number, he took possession of it by immediately \nundressing himself and crawling into bed.  The rapidity with which \nan agitated gambler subsided into a snoring slumberer, was one of \nthe most singular effects I have ever witnessed.  As to the ladies, \nthey were already abed, behind the red curtain, which was carefully \ndrawn and pinned up the centre; though as every cough, or sneeze, \nor whisper, behind this curtain, was perfectly audible before it, \nwe had still a lively consciousness of their society.\n\nThe politeness of the person in authority had secured to me a shelf \nin a nook near this red curtain, in some degree removed from the \ngreat body of sleepers:  to which place I retired, with many \nacknowledgments to him for his attention.  I found it, on after-\nmeasurement, just the width of an ordinary sheet of Bath post \nletter-paper; and I was at first in some uncertainty as to the best \nmeans of getting into it.  But the shelf being a bottom one, I \nfinally determined on lying upon the floor, rolling gently in, \nstopping immediately I touched the mattress, and remaining for the \nnight with that side uppermost, whatever it might be.  Luckily, I \ncame upon my back at exactly the right moment.  I was much alarmed \non looking upward, to see, by the shape of his half-yard of sacking \n(which his weight had bent into an exceedingly tight bag), that \nthere was a very heavy gentleman above me, whom the slender cords \nseemed quite incapable of holding; and I could not help reflecting \nupon the grief of my wife and family in the event of his coming \ndown in the night.  But as I could not have got up again without a \nsevere bodily struggle, which might have alarmed the ladies; and as \nI had nowhere to go to, even if I had; I shut my eyes upon the \ndanger, and remained there.\n\nOne of two remarkable circumstances is indisputably a fact, with \nreference to that class of society who travel in these boats.  \nEither they carry their restlessness to such a pitch that they \nnever sleep at all; or they expectorate in dreams, which would be a \nremarkable mingling of the real and ideal.  All night long, and \nevery night, on this canal, there was a perfect storm and tempest \nof spitting; and once my coat, being in the very centre of the \nhurricane sustained by five gentlemen (which moved vertically, \nstrictly carrying out Reid\'s Theory of the Law of Storms), I was \nfain the next morning to lay it on the deck, and rub it down with \nfair water before it was in a condition to be worn again.\n\nBetween five and six o\'clock in the morning we got up, and some of \nus went on deck, to give them an opportunity of taking the shelves \ndown; while others, the morning being very cold, crowded round the \nrusty stove, cherishing the newly kindled fire, and filling the \ngrate with those voluntary contributions of which they had been so \nliberal all night.  The washing accommodations were primitive.  \nThere was a tin ladle chained to the deck, with which every \ngentleman who thought it necessary to cleanse himself (many were \nsuperior to this weakness), fished the dirty water out of the \ncanal, and poured it into a tin basin, secured in like manner.  \nThere was also a jack-towel.  And, hanging up before a little \nlooking-glass in the bar, in the immediate vicinity of the bread \nand cheese and biscuits, were a public comb and hair-brush.\n\nAt eight o\'clock, the shelves being taken down and put away and the \ntables joined together, everybody sat down to the tea, coffee, \nbread, butter, salmon, shad, liver, steak, potatoes, pickles, ham, \nchops, black-puddings, and sausages, all over again.  Some were \nfond of compounding this variety, and having it all on their plates \nat once.  As each gentleman got through his own personal amount of \ntea, coffee, bread, butter, salmon, shad, liver, steak, potatoes, \npickles, ham, chops, black-puddings, and sausages, he rose up and \nwalked off.  When everybody had done with everything, the fragments \nwere cleared away:  and one of the waiters appearing anew in the \ncharacter of a barber, shaved such of the company as desired to be \nshaved; while the remainder looked on, or yawned over their \nnewspapers.  Dinner was breakfast again, without the tea and \ncoffee; and supper and breakfast were identical.\n\nThere was a man on board this boat, with a light fresh-coloured \nface, and a pepper-and-salt suit of clothes, who was the most \ninquisitive fellow that can possibly be imagined.  He never spoke \notherwise than interrogatively.  He was an embodied inquiry.  \nSitting down or standing up, still or moving, walking the deck or \ntaking his meals, there he was, with a great note of interrogation \nin each eye, two in his cocked ears, two more in his turned-up nose \nand chin, at least half a dozen more about the corners of his \nmouth, and the largest one of all in his hair, which was brushed \npertly off his forehead in a flaxen clump.  Every button in his \nclothes said, \'Eh?  What\'s that?  Did you speak?  Say that again, \nwill you?\'  He was always wide awake, like the enchanted bride who \ndrove her husband frantic; always restless; always thirsting for \nanswers; perpetually seeking and never finding.  There never was \nsuch a curious man.\n\nI wore a fur great-coat at that time, and before we were well clear \nof the wharf, he questioned me concerning it, and its price, and \nwhere I bought it, and when, and what fur it was, and what it \nweighed, and what it cost.  Then he took notice of my watch, and \nasked me what THAT cost, and whether it was a French watch, and \nwhere I got it, and how I got it, and whether I bought it or had it \ngiven me, and how it went, and where the key-hole was, and when I \nwound it, every night or every morning, and whether I ever forgot \nto wind it at all, and if I did, what then?  Where had I been to \nlast, and where was I going next, and where was I going after that, \nand had I seen the President, and what did he say, and what did I \nsay, and what did he say when I had said that?  Eh?  Lor now! do \ntell!\n\nFinding that nothing would satisfy him, I evaded his questions \nafter the first score or two, and in particular pleaded ignorance \nrespecting the name of the fur whereof the coat was made.  I am \nunable to say whether this was the reason, but that coat fascinated \nhim afterwards; he usually kept close behind me as I walked, and \nmoved as I moved, that he might look at it the better; and he \nfrequently dived into narrow places after me at the risk of his \nlife, that he might have the satisfaction of passing his hand up \nthe back, and rubbing it the wrong way.\n\nWe had another odd specimen on board, of a different kind.  This \nwas a thin-faced, spare-figured man of middle age and stature, \ndressed in a dusty drabbish-coloured suit, such as I never saw \nbefore.  He was perfectly quiet during the first part of the \njourney:  indeed I don\'t remember having so much as seen him until \nhe was brought out by circumstances, as great men often are.  The \nconjunction of events which made him famous, happened, briefly, \nthus.\n\nThe canal extends to the foot of the mountain, and there, of \ncourse, it stops; the passengers being conveyed across it by land \ncarriage, and taken on afterwards by another canal boat, the \ncounterpart of the first, which awaits them on the other side.  \nThere are two canal lines of passage-boats; one is called The \nExpress, and one (a cheaper one) The Pioneer.  The Pioneer gets \nfirst to the mountain, and waits for the Express people to come up; \nboth sets of passengers being conveyed across it at the same time.  \nWe were the Express company; but when we had crossed the mountain, \nand had come to the second boat, the proprietors took it into their \nbeads to draft all the Pioneers into it likewise, so that we were \nfive-and-forty at least, and the accession of passengers was not at \nall of that kind which improved the prospect of sleeping at night.  \nOur people grumbled at this, as people do in such cases; but \nsuffered the boat to be towed off with the whole freight aboard \nnevertheless; and away we went down the canal.  At home, I should \nhave protested lustily, but being a foreigner here, I held my \npeace.  Not so this passenger.  He cleft a path among the people on \ndeck (we were nearly all on deck), and without addressing anybody \nwhomsoever, soliloquised as follows:\n\n\'This may suit YOU, this may, but it don\'t suit ME.  This may be \nall very well with Down Easters, and men of Boston raising, but it \nwon\'t suit my figure nohow; and no two ways about THAT; and so I \ntell you.  Now!  I\'m from the brown forests of Mississippi, I am, \nand when the sun shines on me, it does shine - a little.  It don\'t \nglimmer where I live, the sun don\'t.  No.  I\'m a brown forester, I \nam.  I an\'t a Johnny Cake.  There are no smooth skins where I live.  \nWe\'re rough men there.  Rather.  If Down Easters and men of Boston \nraising like this, I\'m glad of it, but I\'m none of that raising nor \nof that breed.  No.  This company wants a little fixing, IT does.  \nI\'m the wrong sort of man for \'em, I am.  They won\'t like me, THEY \nwon\'t.  This is piling of it up, a little too mountainous, this \nis.\'  At the end of every one of these short sentences he turned \nupon his heel, and walked the other way; checking himself abruptly \nwhen he had finished another short sentence, and turning back \nagain.\n\nIt is impossible for me to say what terrific meaning was hidden in \nthe words of this brown forester, but I know that the other \npassengers looked on in a sort of admiring horror, and that \npresently the boat was put back to the wharf, and as many of the \nPioneers as could be coaxed or bullied into going away, were got \nrid of.\n\nWhen we started again, some of the boldest spirits on board, made \nbold to say to the obvious occasion of this improvement in our \nprospects, \'Much obliged to you, sir;\' whereunto the brown forester \n(waving his hand, and still walking up and down as before), \nreplied, \'No you an\'t.  You\'re none o\' my raising.  You may act for \nyourselves, YOU may.  I have pinted out the way.  Down Easters and \nJohnny Cakes can follow if they please.  I an\'t a Johnny Cake, I \nan\'t.  I am from the brown forests of the Mississippi, I am\' - and \nso on, as before.  He was unanimously voted one of the tables for \nhis bed at night - there is a great contest for the tables - in \nconsideration for his public services:  and he had the warmest \ncorner by the stove throughout the rest of the journey.  But I \nnever could find out that he did anything except sit there; nor did \nI hear him speak again until, in the midst of the bustle and \nturmoil of getting the luggage ashore in the dark at Pittsburg, I \nstumbled over him as he sat smoking a cigar on the cabin steps, and \nheard him muttering to himself, with a short laugh of defiance, \'I \nan\'t a Johnny Cake, - I an\'t.  I\'m from the brown forests of the \nMississippi, I am, damme!\'  I am inclined to argue from this, that \nhe had never left off saying so; but I could not make an affidavit \nof that part of the story, if required to do so by my Queen and \nCountry.\n\nAs we have not reached Pittsburg yet, however, in the order of our \nnarrative, I may go on to remark that breakfast was perhaps the \nleast desirable meal of the day, as in addition to the many savoury \nodours arising from the eatables already mentioned, there were \nwhiffs of gin, whiskey, brandy, and rum, from the little bar hard \nby, and a decided seasoning of stale tobacco.  Many of the \ngentlemen passengers were far from particular in respect of their \nlinen, which was in some cases as yellow as the little rivulets \nthat had trickled from the corners of their mouths in chewing, and \ndried there.  Nor was the atmosphere quite free from zephyr \nwhisperings of the thirty beds which had just been cleared away, \nand of which we were further and more pressingly reminded by the \noccasional appearance on the table-cloth of a kind of Game, not \nmentioned in the Bill of Fare.\n\nAnd yet despite these oddities - and even they had, for me at \nleast, a humour of their own - there was much in this mode of \ntravelling which I heartily enjoyed at the time, and look back upon \nwith great pleasure.  Even the running up, bare-necked, at five \no\'clock in the morning, from the tainted cabin to the dirty deck; \nscooping up the icy water, plunging one\'s head into it, and drawing \nit out, all fresh and glowing with the cold; was a good thing.  The \nfast, brisk walk upon the towing-path, between that time and \nbreakfast, when every vein and artery seemed to tingle with health; \nthe exquisite beauty of the opening day, when light came gleaming \noff from everything; the lazy motion of the boat, when one lay idly \non the deck, looking through, rather than at, the deep blue sky; \nthe gliding on at night, so noiselessly, past frowning hills, \nsullen with dark trees, and sometimes angry in one red, burning \nspot high up, where unseen men lay crouching round a fire; the \nshining out of the bright stars undisturbed by noise of wheels or \nsteam, or any other sound than the limpid rippling of the water as \nthe boat went on:  all these were pure delights.\n\nThen there were new settlements and detached log-cabins and frame-\nhouses, full of interest for strangers from an old country:  cabins \nwith simple ovens, outside, made of clay; and lodgings for the pigs \nnearly as good as many of the human quarters; broken windows, \npatched with worn-out hats, old clothes, old boards, fragments of \nblankets and paper; and home-made dressers standing in the open air \nwithout the door, whereon was ranged the household store, not hard \nto count, of earthen jars and pots.  The eye was pained to see the \nstumps of great trees thickly strewn in every field of wheat, and \nseldom to lose the eternal swamp and dull morass, with hundreds of \nrotten trunks and twisted branches steeped in its unwholesome \nwater.  It was quite sad and oppressive, to come upon great tracts \nwhere settlers had been burning down the trees, and where their \nwounded bodies lay about, like those of murdered creatures, while \nhere and there some charred and blackened giant reared aloft two \nwithered arms, and seemed to call down curses on his foes.  \nSometimes, at night, the way wound through some lonely gorge, like \na mountain pass in Scotland, shining and coldly glittering in the \nlight of the moon, and so closed in by high steep hills all round, \nthat there seemed to be no egress save through the narrower path by \nwhich we had come, until one rugged hill-side seemed to open, and \nshutting out the moonlight as we passed into its gloomy throat, \nwrapped our new course in shade and darkness.\n\nWe had left Harrisburg on Friday.  On Sunday morning we arrived at \nthe foot of the mountain, which is crossed by railroad.  There are \nten inclined planes; five ascending, and five descending; the \ncarriages are dragged up the former, and let slowly down the \nlatter, by means of stationary engines; the comparatively level \nspaces between, being traversed, sometimes by horse, and sometimes \nby engine power, as the case demands.  Occasionally the rails are \nlaid upon the extreme verge of a giddy precipice; and looking from \nthe carriage window, the traveller gazes sheer down, without a \nstone or scrap of fence between, into the mountain depths below.  \nThe journey is very carefully made, however; only two carriages \ntravelling together; and while proper precautions are taken, is not \nto be dreaded for its dangers.\n\nIt was very pretty travelling thus, at a rapid pace along the \nheights of the mountain in a keen wind, to look down into a valley \nfull of light and softness; catching glimpses, through the tree-\ntops, of scattered cabins; children running to the doors; dogs \nbursting out to bark, whom we could see without hearing:  terrified \npigs scampering homewards; families sitting out in their rude \ngardens; cows gazing upward with a stupid indifference; men in \ntheir shirt-sleeves looking on at their unfinished houses, planning \nout to-morrow\'s work; and we riding onward, high above them, like a \nwhirlwind.  It was amusing, too, when we had dined, and rattled \ndown a steep pass, having no other moving power than the weight of \nthe carriages themselves, to see the engine released, long after \nus, come buzzing down alone, like a great insect, its back of green \nand gold so shining in the sun, that if it had spread a pair of \nwings and soared away, no one would have had occasion, as I \nfancied, for the least surprise.  But it stopped short of us in a \nvery business-like manner when we reached the canal:  and, before \nwe left the wharf, went panting up this hill again, with the \npassengers who had waited our arrival for the means of traversing \nthe road by which we had come.\n\nOn the Monday evening, furnace fires and clanking hammers on the \nbanks of the canal, warned us that we approached the termination of \nthis part of our journey.  After going through another dreamy place \n- a long aqueduct across the Alleghany River, which was stranger \nthan the bridge at Harrisburg, being a vast, low, wooden chamber \nfull of water - we emerged upon that ugly confusion of backs of \nbuildings and crazy galleries and stairs, which always abuts on \nwater, whether it be river, sea, canal, or ditch:  and were at \nPittsburg.\n\nPittsburg is like Birmingham in England; at least its townspeople \nsay so.  Setting aside the streets, the shops, the houses, waggons, \nfactories, public buildings, and population, perhaps it may be.  It \ncertainly has a great quantity of smoke hanging about it, and is \nfamous for its iron-works.  Besides the prison to which I have \nalready referred, this town contains a pretty arsenal and other \ninstitutions.  It is very beautifully situated on the Alleghany \nRiver, over which there are two bridges; and the villas of the \nwealthier citizens sprinkled about the high grounds in the \nneighbourhood, are pretty enough.  We lodged at a most excellent \nhotel, and were admirably served.  As usual it was full of \nboarders, was very large, and had a broad colonnade to every story \nof the house.\n\nWe tarried here three days.  Our next point was Cincinnati:  and as \nthis was a steamboat journey, and western steamboats usually blow \nup one or two a week in the season, it was advisable to collect \nopinions in reference to the comparative safety of the vessels \nbound that way, then lying in the river.  One called the Messenger \nwas the best recommended.  She had been advertised to start \npositively, every day for a fortnight or so, and had not gone yet, \nnor did her captain seem to have any very fixed intention on the \nsubject.  But this is the custom:  for if the law were to bind down \na free and independent citizen to keep his word with the public, \nwhat would become of the liberty of the subject?  Besides, it is in \nthe way of trade.  And if passengers be decoyed in the way of \ntrade, and people be inconvenienced in the way of trade, what man, \nwho is a sharp tradesman himself, shall say, \'We must put a stop to \nthis?\'\n\nImpressed by the deep solemnity of the public announcement, I \n(being then ignorant of these usages) was for hurrying on board in \na breathless state, immediately; but receiving private and \nconfidential information that the boat would certainly not start \nuntil Friday, April the First, we made ourselves very comfortable \nin the mean while, and went on board at noon that day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI - FROM PITTSBURG TO CINCINNATI IN A WESTERN STEAMBOAT.  \nCINCINNATI\n\n\n\nTHE Messenger was one among a crowd of high-pressure steamboats, \nclustered together by a wharf-side, which, looked down upon from \nthe rising ground that forms the landing-place, and backed by the \nlofty bank on the opposite side of the river, appeared no larger \nthan so many floating models.  She had some forty passengers on \nboard, exclusive of the poorer persons on the lower deck; and in \nhalf an hour, or less, proceeded on her way.\n\nWe had, for ourselves, a tiny state-room with two berths in it, \nopening out of the ladies\' cabin.  There was, undoubtedly, \nsomething satisfactory in this \'location,\' inasmuch as it was in \nthe stern, and we had been a great many times very gravely \nrecommended to keep as far aft as possible, \'because the steamboats \ngenerally blew up forward.\'  Nor was this an unnecessary caution, \nas the occurrence and circumstances of more than one such fatality \nduring our stay sufficiently testified.  Apart from this source of \nself-congratulation, it was an unspeakable relief to have any \nplace, no matter how confined, where one could be alone:  and as \nthe row of little chambers of which this was one, had each a second \nglass-door besides that in the ladies\' cabin, which opened on a \nnarrow gallery outside the vessel, where the other passengers \nseldom came, and where one could sit in peace and gaze upon the \nshifting prospect, we took possession of our new quarters with much \npleasure.\n\nIf the native packets I have already described be unlike anything \nwe are in the habit of seeing on water, these western vessels are \nstill more foreign to all the ideas we are accustomed to entertain \nof boats.  I hardly know what to liken them to, or how to describe \nthem.\n\nIn the first place, they have no mast, cordage, tackle, rigging, or \nother such boat-like gear; nor have they anything in their shape at \nall calculated to remind one of a boat\'s head, stem, sides, or \nkeel.  Except that they are in the water, and display a couple of \npaddle-boxes, they might be intended, for anything that appears to \nthe contrary, to perform some unknown service, high and dry, upon a \nmountain top.  There is no visible deck, even:  nothing but a long, \nblack, ugly roof covered with burnt-out feathery sparks; above \nwhich tower two iron chimneys, and a hoarse escape valve, and a \nglass steerage-house.  Then, in order as the eye descends towards \nthe water, are the sides, and doors, and windows of the state-\nrooms, jumbled as oddly together as though they formed a small \nstreet, built by the varying tastes of a dozen men:  the whole is \nsupported on beams and pillars resting on a dirty barge, but a few \ninches above the water\'s edge:  and in the narrow space between \nthis upper structure and this barge\'s deck, are the furnace fires \nand machinery, open at the sides to every wind that blows, and \nevery storm of rain it drives along its path.\n\nPassing one of these boats at night, and seeing the great body of \nfire, exposed as I have just described, that rages and roars \nbeneath the frail pile of painted wood:  the machinery, not warded \noff or guarded in any way, but doing its work in the midst of the \ncrowd of idlers and emigrants and children, who throng the lower \ndeck:  under the management, too, of reckless men whose \nacquaintance with its mysteries may have been of six months\' \nstanding:  one feels directly that the wonder is, not that there \nshould be so many fatal accidents, but that any journey should be \nsafely made.\n\nWithin, there is one long narrow cabin, the whole length of the \nboat; from which the state-rooms open, on both sides.  A small \nportion of it at the stern is partitioned off for the ladies; and \nthe bar is at the opposite extreme.  There is a long table down the \ncentre, and at either end a stove.  The washing apparatus is \nforward, on the deck.  It is a little better than on board the \ncanal boat, but not much.  In all modes of travelling, the American \ncustoms, with reference to the means of personal cleanliness and \nwholesome ablution, are extremely negligent and filthy; and I \nstrongly incline to the belief that a considerable amount of \nillness is referable to this cause.\n\nWe are to be on board the Messenger three days:  arriving at \nCincinnati (barring accidents) on Monday morning.  There are three \nmeals a day.  Breakfast at seven, dinner at half-past twelve, \nsupper about six.  At each, there are a great many small dishes and \nplates upon the table, with very little in them; so that although \nthere is every appearance of a mighty \'spread,\' there is seldom \nreally more than a joint:  except for those who fancy slices of \nbeet-root, shreds of dried beef, complicated entanglements of \nyellow pickle; maize, Indian corn, apple-sauce, and pumpkin.\n\nSome people fancy all these little dainties together (and sweet \npreserves beside), by way of relish to their roast pig.  They are \ngenerally those dyspeptic ladies and gentlemen who eat unheard-of \nquantities of hot corn bread (almost as good for the digestion as a \nkneaded pin-cushion), for breakfast, and for supper.  Those who do \nnot observe this custom, and who help themselves several times \ninstead, usually suck their knives and forks meditatively, until \nthey have decided what to take next:  then pull them out of their \nmouths:  put them in the dish; help themselves; and fall to work \nagain.  At dinner, there is nothing to drink upon the table, but \ngreat jugs full of cold water.  Nobody says anything, at any meal, \nto anybody.  All the passengers are very dismal, and seem to have \ntremendous secrets weighing on their minds.  There is no \nconversation, no laughter, no cheerfulness, no sociality, except in \nspitting; and that is done in silent fellowship round the stove, \nwhen the meal is over.  Every man sits down, dull and languid; \nswallows his fare as if breakfasts, dinners, and suppers, were \nnecessities of nature never to be coupled with recreation or \nenjoyment; and having bolted his food in a gloomy silence, bolts \nhimself, in the same state.  But for these animal observances, you \nmight suppose the whole male portion of the company to be the \nmelancholy ghosts of departed book-keepers, who had fallen dead at \nthe desk:  such is their weary air of business and calculation.  \nUndertakers on duty would be sprightly beside them; and a collation \nof funeral-baked meats, in comparison with these meals, would be a \nsparkling festivity.\n\nThe people are all alike, too.  There is no diversity of character.  \nThey travel about on the same errands, say and do the same things \nin exactly the same manner, and follow in the same dull cheerless \nround.  All down the long table, there is scarcely a man who is in \nanything different from his neighbour.  It is quite a relief to \nhave, sitting opposite, that little girl of fifteen with the \nloquacious chin:  who, to do her justice, acts up to it, and fully \nidentifies nature\'s handwriting, for of all the small chatterboxes \nthat ever invaded the repose of drowsy ladies\' cabin, she is the \nfirst and foremost.  The beautiful girl, who sits a little beyond \nher - farther down the table there - married the young man with the \ndark whiskers, who sits beyond HER, only last month.  They are \ngoing to settle in the very Far West, where he has lived four \nyears, but where she has never been.  They were both overturned in \na stage-coach the other day (a bad omen anywhere else, where \noverturns are not so common), and his head, which bears the marks \nof a recent wound, is bound up still.  She was hurt too, at the \nsame time, and lay insensible for some days; bright as her eyes \nare, now.\n\nFurther down still, sits a man who is going some miles beyond their \nplace of destination, to \'improve\' a newly-discovered copper mine.  \nHe carries the village - that is to be - with him:  a few frame \ncottages, and an apparatus for smelting the copper.  He carries its \npeople too.  They are partly American and partly Irish, and herd \ntogether on the lower deck; where they amused themselves last \nevening till the night was pretty far advanced, by alternately \nfiring off pistols and singing hymns.\n\nThey, and the very few who have been left at table twenty minutes, \nrise, and go away.  We do so too; and passing through our little \nstate-room, resume our seats in the quiet gallery without.\n\nA fine broad river always, but in some parts much wider than in \nothers:  and then there is usually a green island, covered with \ntrees, dividing it into two streams.  Occasionally, we stop for a \nfew minutes, maybe to take in wood, maybe for passengers, at some \nsmall town or village (I ought to say city, every place is a city \nhere); but the banks are for the most part deep solitudes, \novergrown with trees, which, hereabouts, are already in leaf and \nvery green.  For miles, and miles, and miles, these solitudes are \nunbroken by any sign of human life or trace of human footstep; nor \nis anything seen to move about them but the blue jay, whose colour \nis so bright, and yet so delicate, that it looks like a flying \nflower.  At lengthened intervals a log cabin, with its little space \nof cleared land about it, nestles under a rising ground, and sends \nits thread of blue smoke curling up into the sky.  It stands in the \ncorner of the poor field of wheat, which is full of great unsightly \nstumps, like earthy butchers\'-blocks.  Sometimes the ground is only \njust now cleared:  the felled trees lying yet upon the soil:  and \nthe log-house only this morning begun.  As we pass this clearing, \nthe settler leans upon his axe or hammer, and looks wistfully at \nthe people from the world.  The children creep out of the temporary \nhut, which is like a gipsy tent upon the ground, and clap their \nhands and shout.  The dog only glances round at us, and then looks \nup into his master\'s face again, as if he were rendered uneasy by \nany suspension of the common business, and had nothing more to do \nwith pleasurers.  And still there is the same, eternal foreground.  \nThe river has washed away its banks, and stately trees have fallen \ndown into the stream.  Some have been there so long, that they are \nmere dry, grizzly skeletons.  Some have just toppled over, and \nhaving earth yet about their roots, are bathing their green heads \nin the river, and putting forth new shoots and branches.  Some are \nalmost sliding down, as you look at them.  And some were drowned so \nlong ago, that their bleached arms start out from the middle of the \ncurrent, and seem to try to grasp the boat, and drag it under \nwater.\n\nThrough such a scene as this, the unwieldy machine takes its \nhoarse, sullen way:  venting, at every revolution of the paddles, a \nloud high-pressure blast; enough, one would think, to waken up the \nhost of Indians who lie buried in a great mound yonder:  so old, \nthat mighty oaks and other forest trees have struck their roots \ninto its earth; and so high, that it is a hill, even among the \nhills that Nature planted round it.  The very river, as though it \nshared one\'s feelings of compassion for the extinct tribes who \nlived so pleasantly here, in their blessed ignorance of white \nexistence, hundreds of years ago, steals out of its way to ripple \nnear this mound:  and there are few places where the Ohio sparkles \nmore brightly than in the Big Grave Creek.\n\nAll this I see as I sit in the little stern-gallery mentioned just \nnow.  Evening slowly steals upon the landscape and changes it \nbefore me, when we stop to set some emigrants ashore.\n\nFive men, as many women, and a little girl.  All their worldly \ngoods are a bag, a large chest and an old chair:  one, old, high-\nbacked, rush-bottomed chair:  a solitary settler in itself.  They \nare rowed ashore in the boat, while the vessel stands a little off \nawaiting its return, the water being shallow.  They are landed at \nthe foot of a high bank, on the summit of which are a few log \ncabins, attainable only by a long winding path.  It is growing \ndusk; but the sun is very red, and shines in the water and on some \nof the tree-tops, like fire.\n\nThe men get out of the boat first; help out the women; take out the \nbag, the chest, the chair; bid the rowers \'good-bye;\' and shove the \nboat off for them.  At the first plash of the oars in the water, \nthe oldest woman of the party sits down in the old chair, close to \nthe water\'s edge, without speaking a word.  None of the others sit \ndown, though the chest is large enough for many seats.  They all \nstand where they landed, as if stricken into stone; and look after \nthe boat.  So they remain, quite still and silent:  the old woman \nand her old chair, in the centre the bag and chest upon the shore, \nwithout anybody heeding them all eyes fixed upon the boat.  It \ncomes alongside, is made fast, the men jump on board, the engine is \nput in motion, and we go hoarsely on again.  There they stand yet, \nwithout the motion of a hand.  I can see them through my glass, \nwhen, in the distance and increasing darkness, they are mere specks \nto the eye:  lingering there still:  the old woman in the old \nchair, and all the rest about her:  not stirring in the least \ndegree.  And thus I slowly lose them.\n\nThe night is dark, and we proceed within the shadow of the wooded \nbank, which makes it darker.  After gliding past the sombre maze of \nboughs for a long time, we come upon an open space where the tall \ntrees are burning.  The shape of every branch and twig is expressed \nin a deep red glow, and as the light wind stirs and ruffles it, \nthey seem to vegetate in fire.  It is such a sight as we read of in \nlegends of enchanted forests:  saving that it is sad to see these \nnoble works wasting away so awfully, alone; and to think how many \nyears must come and go before the magic that created them will rear \ntheir like upon this ground again.  But the time will come; and \nwhen, in their changed ashes, the growth of centuries unborn has \nstruck its roots, the restless men of distant ages will repair to \nthese again unpeopled solitudes; and their fellows, in cities far \naway, that slumber now, perhaps, beneath the rolling sea, will read \nin language strange to any ears in being now, but very old to them, \nof primeval forests where the axe was never heard, and where the \njungled ground was never trodden by a human foot.\n\nMidnight and sleep blot out these scenes and thoughts:  and when \nthe morning shines again, it gilds the house-tops of a lively city, \nbefore whose broad paved wharf the boat is moored; with other \nboats, and flags, and moving wheels, and hum of men around it; as \nthough there were not a solitary or silent rood of ground within \nthe compass of a thousand miles.\n\nCincinnati is a beautiful city; cheerful, thriving, and animated.  \nI have not often seen a place that commends itself so favourably \nand pleasantly to a stranger at the first glance as this does:  \nwith its clean houses of red and white, its well-paved roads, and \nfoot-ways of bright tile.  Nor does it become less prepossessing on \na closer acquaintance.  The streets are broad and airy, the shops \nextremely good, the private residences remarkable for their \nelegance and neatness.  There is something of invention and fancy \nin the varying styles of these latter erections, which, after the \ndull company of the steamboat, is perfectly delightful, as \nconveying an assurance that there are such qualities still in \nexistence.  The disposition to ornament these pretty villas and \nrender them attractive, leads to the culture of trees and flowers, \nand the laying out of well-kept gardens, the sight of which, to \nthose who walk along the streets, is inexpressibly refreshing and \nagreeable.  I was quite charmed with the appearance of the town, \nand its adjoining suburb of Mount Auburn:  from which the city, \nlying in an amphitheatre of hills, forms a picture of remarkable \nbeauty, and is seen to great advantage.\n\nThere happened to be a great Temperance Convention held here on the \nday after our arrival; and as the order of march brought the \nprocession under the windows of the hotel in which we lodged, when \nthey started in the morning, I had a good opportunity of seeing it.  \nIt comprised several thousand men; the members of various \n\'Washington Auxiliary Temperance Societies;\' and was marshalled by \nofficers on horseback, who cantered briskly up and down the line, \nwith scarves and ribbons of bright colours fluttering out behind \nthem gaily.  There were bands of music too, and banners out of \nnumber:  and it was a fresh, holiday-looking concourse altogether.\n\nI was particularly pleased to see the Irishmen, who formed a \ndistinct society among themselves, and mustered very strong with \ntheir green scarves; carrying their national Harp and their \nPortrait of Father Mathew, high above the people\'s heads.  They \nlooked as jolly and good-humoured as ever; and, working (here) the \nhardest for their living and doing any kind of sturdy labour that \ncame in their way, were the most independent fellows there, I \nthought.\n\nThe banners were very well painted, and flaunted down the street \nfamously.  There was the smiting of the rock, and the gushing forth \nof the waters; and there was a temperate man with \'considerable of \na hatchet\' (as the standard-bearer would probably have said), \naiming a deadly blow at a serpent which was apparently about to \nspring upon him from the top of a barrel of spirits.  But the chief \nfeature of this part of the show was a huge allegorical device, \nborne among the ship-carpenters, on one side whereof the steamboat \nAlcohol was represented bursting her boiler and exploding with a \ngreat crash, while upon the other, the good ship Temperance sailed \naway with a fair wind, to the heart\'s content of the captain, crew, \nand passengers.\n\nAfter going round the town, the procession repaired to a certain \nappointed place, where, as the printed programme set forth, it \nwould be received by the children of the different free schools, \n\'singing Temperance Songs.\'  I was prevented from getting there, in \ntime to hear these Little Warblers, or to report upon this novel \nkind of vocal entertainment:  novel, at least, to me:  but I found \nin a large open space, each society gathered round its own banners, \nand listening in silent attention to its own orator.  The speeches, \njudging from the little I could hear of them, were certainly \nadapted to the occasion, as having that degree of relationship to \ncold water which wet blankets may claim:  but the main thing was \nthe conduct and appearance of the audience throughout the day; and \nthat was admirable and full of promise.\n\nCincinnati is honourably famous for its free schools, of which it \nhas so many that no person\'s child among its population can, by \npossibility, want the means of education, which are extended, upon \nan average, to four thousand pupils, annually.  I was only present \nin one of these establishments during the hours of instruction.  In \nthe boys\' department, which was full of little urchins (varying in \ntheir ages, I should say, from six years old to ten or twelve), the \nmaster offered to institute an extemporary examination of the \npupils in algebra; a proposal, which, as I was by no means \nconfident of my ability to detect mistakes in that science, I \ndeclined with some alarm.  In the girls\' school, reading was \nproposed; and as I felt tolerably equal to that art, I expressed my \nwillingness to hear a class.  Books were distributed accordingly, \nand some half-dozen girls relieved each other in reading paragraphs \nfrom English History.  But it seemed to be a dry compilation, \ninfinitely above their powers; and when they had blundered through \nthree or four dreary passages concerning the Treaty of Amiens, and \nother thrilling topics of the same nature (obviously without \ncomprehending ten words), I expressed myself quite satisfied.  It \nis very possible that they only mounted to this exalted stave in \nthe Ladder of Learning for the astonishment of a visitor; and that \nat other times they keep upon its lower rounds; but I should have \nbeen much better pleased and satisfied if I had heard them \nexercised in simpler lessons, which they understood.\n\nAs in every other place I visited, the judges here were gentlemen \nof high character and attainments.  I was in one of the courts for \na few minutes, and found it like those to which I have already \nreferred.  A nuisance cause was trying; there were not many \nspectators; and the witnesses, counsel, and jury, formed a sort of \nfamily circle, sufficiently jocose and snug.\n\nThe society with which I mingled, was intelligent, courteous, and \nagreeable.  The inhabitants of Cincinnati are proud of their city \nas one of the most interesting in America:  and with good reason:  \nfor beautiful and thriving as it is now, and containing, as it \ndoes, a population of fifty thousand souls, but two-and-fifty years \nhave passed away since the ground on which it stands (bought at \nthat time for a few dollars) was a wild wood, and its citizens were \nbut a handful of dwellers in scattered log huts upon the river\'s \nshore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII - FROM CINCINNATI TO LOUISVILLE IN ANOTHER WESTERN \nSTEAMBOAT; AND FROM LOUISVILLE TO ST. LOUIS IN ANOTHER.  ST. LOUIS\n\n\n\nLEAVING Cincinnati at eleven o\'clock in the forenoon, we embarked \nfor Louisville in the Pike steamboat, which, carrying the mails, \nwas a packet of a much better class than that in which we had come \nfrom Pittsburg.  As this passage does not occupy more than twelve \nor thirteen hours, we arranged to go ashore that night:  not \ncoveting the distinction of sleeping in a state-room, when it was \npossible to sleep anywhere else.\n\nThere chanced to be on board this boat, in addition to the usual \ndreary crowd of passengers, one Pitchlynn, a chief of the Choctaw \ntribe of Indians, who SENT IN HIS CARD to me, and with whom I had \nthe pleasure of a long conversation.\n\nHe spoke English perfectly well, though he had not begun to learn \nthe language, he told me, until he was a young man grown.  He had \nread many books; and Scott\'s poetry appeared to have left a strong \nimpression on his mind:  especially the opening of The Lady of the \nLake, and the great battle scene in Marmion, in which, no doubt \nfrom the congeniality of the subjects to his own pursuits and \ntastes, he had great interest and delight.  He appeared to \nunderstand correctly all he had read; and whatever fiction had \nenlisted his sympathy in its belief, had done so keenly and \nearnestly.  I might almost say fiercely.  He was dressed in our \nordinary everyday costume, which hung about his fine figure \nloosely, and with indifferent grace.  On my telling him that I \nregretted not to see him in his own attire, he threw up his right \narm, for a moment, as though he were brandishing some heavy weapon, \nand answered, as he let it fall again, that his race were losing \nmany things besides their dress, and would soon be seen upon the \nearth no more:  but he wore it at home, he added proudly.\n\nHe told me that he had been away from his home, west of the \nMississippi, seventeen months:  and was now returning.  He had been \nchiefly at Washington on some negotiations pending between his \nTribe and the Government:  which were not settled yet (he said in a \nmelancholy way), and he feared never would be:  for what could a \nfew poor Indians do, against such well-skilled men of business as \nthe whites?  He had no love for Washington; tired of towns and \ncities very soon; and longed for the Forest and the Prairie.\n\nI asked him what he thought of Congress?  He answered, with a \nsmile, that it wanted dignity, in an Indian\'s eyes.\n\nHe would very much like, he said, to see England before he died; \nand spoke with much interest about the great things to be seen \nthere.  When I told him of that chamber in the British Museum \nwherein are preserved household memorials of a race that ceased to \nbe, thousands of years ago, he was very attentive, and it was not \nhard to see that he had a reference in his mind to the gradual \nfading away of his own people.\n\nThis led us to speak of Mr. Catlin\'s gallery, which he praised \nhighly:  observing that his own portrait was among the collection, \nand that all the likenesses were \'elegant.\'  Mr. Cooper, he said, \nhad painted the Red Man well; and so would I, he knew, if I would \ngo home with him and hunt buffaloes, which he was quite anxious I \nshould do.  When I told him that supposing I went, I should not be \nvery likely to damage the buffaloes much, he took it as a great \njoke and laughed heartily.\n\nHe was a remarkably handsome man; some years past forty, I should \njudge; with long black hair, an aquiline nose, broad cheek-bones, a \nsunburnt complexion, and a very bright, keen, dark, and piercing \neye.  There were but twenty thousand of the Choctaws left, he said, \nand their number was decreasing every day.  A few of his brother \nchiefs had been obliged to become civilised, and to make themselves \nacquainted with what the whites knew, for it was their only chance \nof existence.  But they were not many; and the rest were as they \nalways had been.  He dwelt on this:  and said several times that \nunless they tried to assimilate themselves to their conquerors, \nthey must be swept away before the strides of civilised society.\n\nWhen we shook hands at parting, I told him he must come to England, \nas he longed to see the land so much:  that I should hope to see \nhim there, one day:  and that I could promise him he would be well \nreceived and kindly treated.  He was evidently pleased by this \nassurance, though he rejoined with a good-humoured smile and an \narch shake of his head, that the English used to be very fond of \nthe Red Men when they wanted their help, but had not cared much for \nthem, since.\n\nHe took his leave; as stately and complete a gentleman of Nature\'s \nmaking, as ever I beheld; and moved among the people in the boat, \nanother kind of being.  He sent me a lithographed portrait of \nhimself soon afterwards; very like, though scarcely handsome \nenough; which I have carefully preserved in memory of our brief \nacquaintance.\n\nThere was nothing very interesting in the scenery of this day\'s \njourney, which brought us at midnight to Louisville.  We slept at \nthe Galt House; a splendid hotel; and were as handsomely lodged as \nthough we had been in Paris, rather than hundreds of miles beyond \nthe Alleghanies.\n\nThe city presenting no objects of sufficient interest to detain us \non our way, we resolved to proceed next day by another steamboat, \nthe Fulton, and to join it, about noon, at a suburb called \nPortland, where it would be delayed some time in passing through a \ncanal.\n\nThe interval, after breakfast, we devoted to riding through the \ntown, which is regular and cheerful:  the streets being laid out at \nright angles, and planted with young trees.  The buildings are \nsmoky and blackened, from the use of bituminous coal, but an \nEnglishman is well used to that appearance, and indisposed to \nquarrel with it.  There did not appear to be much business \nstirring; and some unfinished buildings and improvements seemed to \nintimate that the city had been overbuilt in the ardour of \'going-\na-head,\' and was suffering under the re-action consequent upon such \nfeverish forcing of its powers.\n\nOn our way to Portland, we passed a \'Magistrate\'s office,\' which \namused me, as looking far more like a dame school than any police \nestablishment:  for this awful Institution was nothing but a little \nlazy, good-for-nothing front parlour, open to the street; wherein \ntwo or three figures (I presume the magistrate and his myrmidons) \nwere basking in the sunshine, the very effigies of languor and \nrepose.  It was a perfect picture of justice retired from business \nfor want of customers; her sword and scales sold off; napping \ncomfortably with her legs upon the table.\n\nHere, as elsewhere in these parts, the road was perfectly alive \nwith pigs of all ages; lying about in every direction, fast \nasleep.; or grunting along in quest of hidden dainties.  I had \nalways a sneaking kindness for these odd animals, and found a \nconstant source of amusement, when all others failed, in watching \ntheir proceedings.  As we were riding along this morning, I \nobserved a little incident between two youthful pigs, which was so \nvery human as to be inexpressibly comical and grotesque at the \ntime, though I dare say, in telling, it is tame enough.\n\nOne young gentleman (a very delicate porker with several straws \nsticking about his nose, betokening recent investigations in a \ndung-hill) was walking deliberately on, profoundly thinking, when \nsuddenly his brother, who was lying in a miry hole unseen by him, \nrose up immediately before his startled eyes, ghostly with damp \nmud.  Never was pig\'s whole mass of blood so turned.  He started \nback at least three feet, gazed for a moment, and then shot off as \nhard as he could go:  his excessively little tail vibrating with \nspeed and terror like a distracted pendulum.  But before he had \ngone very far, he began to reason with himself as to the nature of \nthis frightful appearance; and as he reasoned, he relaxed his speed \nby gradual degrees; until at last he stopped, and faced about.  \nThere was his brother, with the mud upon him glazing in the sun, \nyet staring out of the very same hole, perfectly amazed at his \nproceedings!  He was no sooner assured of this; and he assured \nhimself so carefully that one may almost say he shaded his eyes \nwith his hand to see the better; than he came back at a round trot, \npounced upon him, and summarily took off a piece of his tail; as a \ncaution to him to be careful what he was about for the future, and \nnever to play tricks with his family any more.\n\nWe found the steamboat in the canal, waiting for the slow process \nof getting through the lock, and went on board, where we shortly \nafterwards had a new kind of visitor in the person of a certain \nKentucky Giant whose name is Porter, and who is of the moderate \nheight of seven feet eight inches, in his stockings.\n\nThere never was a race of people who so completely gave the lie to \nhistory as these giants, or whom all the chroniclers have so \ncruelly libelled.  Instead of roaring and ravaging about the world, \nconstantly catering for their cannibal larders, and perpetually \ngoing to market in an unlawful manner, they are the meekest people \nin any man\'s acquaintance:  rather inclining to milk and vegetable \ndiet, and bearing anything for a quiet life.  So decidedly are \namiability and mildness their characteristics, that I confess I \nlook upon that youth who distinguished himself by the slaughter of \nthese inoffensive persons, as a false-hearted brigand, who, \npretending to philanthropic motives, was secretly influenced only \nby the wealth stored up within their castles, and the hope of \nplunder.  And I lean the more to this opinion from finding that \neven the historian of those exploits, with all his partiality for \nhis hero, is fain to admit that the slaughtered monsters in \nquestion were of a very innocent and simple turn; extremely \nguileless and ready of belief; lending a credulous ear to the most \nimprobable tales; suffering themselves to be easily entrapped into \npits; and even (as in the case of the Welsh Giant) with an excess \nof the hospitable politeness of a landlord, ripping themselves \nopen, rather than hint at the possibility of their guests being \nversed in the vagabond arts of sleight-of-hand and hocus-pocus.\n\nThe Kentucky Giant was but another illustration of the truth of \nthis position.  He had a weakness in the region of the knees, and a \ntrustfulness in his long face, which appealed even to five-feet \nnine for encouragement and support.  He was only twenty-five years \nold, he said, and had grown recently, for it had been found \nnecessary to make an addition to the legs of his inexpressibles.  \nAt fifteen he was a short boy, and in those days his English father \nand his Irish mother had rather snubbed him, as being too small of \nstature to sustain the credit of the family.  He added that his \nhealth had not been good, though it was better now; but short \npeople are not wanting who whisper that he drinks too hard.\n\nI understand he drives a hackney-coach, though how he does it, \nunless he stands on the footboard behind, and lies along the roof \nupon his chest, with his chin in the box, it would be difficult to \ncomprehend.  He brought his gun with him, as a curiosity.\n\nChristened \'The Little Rifle,\' and displayed outside a shop-window, \nit would make the fortune of any retail business in Holborn.  When \nhe had shown himself and talked a little while, he withdrew with \nhis pocket-instrument, and went bobbing down the cabin, among men \nof six feet high and upwards, like a light-house walking among \nlamp-posts.\n\nWithin a few minutes afterwards, we were out of the canal, and in \nthe Ohio river again.\n\nThe arrangements of the boat were like those of the Messenger, and \nthe passengers were of the same order of people.  We fed at the \nsame times, on the same kind of viands, in the same dull manner, \nand with the same observances.  The company appeared to be \noppressed by the same tremendous concealments, and had as little \ncapacity of enjoyment or light-heartedness.  I never in my life did \nsee such listless, heavy dulness as brooded over these meals:  the \nvery recollection of it weighs me down, and makes me, for the \nmoment, wretched.  Reading and writing on my knee, in our little \ncabin, I really dreaded the coming of the hour that summoned us to \ntable; and was as glad to escape from it again, as if it had been a \npenance or a punishment.  Healthy cheerfulness and good spirits \nforming a part of the banquet, I could soak my crusts in the \nfountain with Le Sage\'s strolling player, and revel in their glad \nenjoyment:  but sitting down with so many fellow-animals to ward \noff thirst and hunger as a business; to empty, each creature, his \nYahoo\'s trough as quickly as he can, and then slink sullenly away; \nto have these social sacraments stripped of everything but the mere \ngreedy satisfaction of the natural cravings; goes so against the \ngrain with me, that I seriously believe the recollection of these \nfuneral feasts will be a waking nightmare to me all my life.\n\nThere was some relief in this boat, too, which there had not been \nin the other, for the captain (a blunt, good-natured fellow) had \nhis handsome wife with him, who was disposed to be lively and \nagreeable, as were a few other lady-passengers who had their seats \nabout us at the same end of the table.  But nothing could have made \nhead against the depressing influence of the general body.  There \nwas a magnetism of dulness in them which would have beaten down the \nmost facetious companion that the earth ever knew.  A jest would \nhave been a crime, and a smile would have faded into a grinning \nhorror.  Such deadly, leaden people; such systematic plodding, \nweary, insupportable heaviness; such a mass of animated indigestion \nin respect of all that was genial, jovial, frank, social, or \nhearty; never, sure, was brought together elsewhere since the world \nbegan.\n\nNor was the scenery, as we approached the junction of the Ohio and \nMississippi rivers, at all inspiriting in its influence.  The trees \nwere stunted in their growth; the banks were low and flat; the \nsettlements and log cabins fewer in number:  their inhabitants more \nwan and wretched than any we had encountered yet.  No songs of \nbirds were in the air, no pleasant scents, no moving lights and \nshadows from swift passing clouds.  Hour after hour, the changeless \nglare of the hot, unwinking sky, shone upon the same monotonous \nobjects.  Hour after hour, the river rolled along, as wearily and \nslowly as the time itself.\n\nAt length, upon the morning of the third day, we arrived at a spot \nso much more desolate than any we had yet beheld, that the \nforlornest places we had passed, were, in comparison with it, full \nof interest.  At the junction of the two rivers, on ground so flat \nand low and marshy, that at certain seasons of the year it is \ninundated to the house-tops, lies a breeding-place of fever, ague, \nand death; vaunted in England as a mine of Golden Hope, and \nspeculated in, on the faith of monstrous representations, to many \npeople\'s ruin.  A dismal swamp, on which the half-built houses rot \naway:  cleared here and there for the space of a few yards; and \nteeming, then, with rank unwholesome vegetation, in whose baleful \nshade the wretched wanderers who are tempted hither, droop, and \ndie, and lay their bones; the hateful Mississippi circling and \neddying before it, and turning off upon its southern course a slimy \nmonster hideous to behold; a hotbed of disease, an ugly sepulchre, \na grave uncheered by any gleam of promise:  a place without one \nsingle quality, in earth or air or water, to commend it:  such is \nthis dismal Cairo.\n\nBut what words shall describe the Mississippi, great father of \nrivers, who (praise be to Heaven) has no young children like him!  \nAn enormous ditch, sometimes two or three miles wide, running \nliquid mud, six miles an hour:  its strong and frothy current \nchoked and obstructed everywhere by huge logs and whole forest \ntrees:  now twining themselves together in great rafts, from the \ninterstices of which a sedgy, lazy foam works up, to float upon the \nwater\'s top; now rolling past like monstrous bodies, their tangled \nroots showing like matted hair; now glancing singly by like giant \nleeches; and now writhing round and round in the vortex of some \nsmall whirlpool, like wounded snakes.  The banks low, the trees \ndwarfish, the marshes swarming with frogs, the wretched cabins few \nand far apart, their inmates hollow-cheeked and pale, the weather \nvery hot, mosquitoes penetrating into every crack and crevice of \nthe boat, mud and slime on everything:  nothing pleasant in its \naspect, but the harmless lightning which flickers every night upon \nthe dark horizon.\n\nFor two days we toiled up this foul stream, striking constantly \nagainst the floating timber, or stopping to avoid those more \ndangerous obstacles, the snags, or sawyers, which are the hidden \ntrunks of trees that have their roots below the tide.  When the \nnights are very dark, the look-out stationed in the head of the \nboat, knows by the ripple of the water if any great impediment be \nnear at hand, and rings a bell beside him, which is the signal for \nthe engine to be stopped:  but always in the night this bell has \nwork to do, and after every ring, there comes a blow which renders \nit no easy matter to remain in bed.\n\nThe decline of day here was very gorgeous; tingeing the firmament \ndeeply with red and gold, up to the very keystone of the arch above \nus.  As the sun went down behind the bank, the slightest blades of \ngrass upon it seemed to become as distinctly visible as the \narteries in the skeleton of a leaf; and when, as it slowly sank, \nthe red and golden bars upon the water grew dimmer, and dimmer yet, \nas if they were sinking too; and all the glowing colours of \ndeparting day paled, inch by inch, before the sombre night; the \nscene became a thousand times more lonesome and more dreary than \nbefore, and all its influences darkened with the sky.\n\nWe drank the muddy water of this river while we were upon it.  It \nis considered wholesome by the natives, and is something more \nopaque than gruel.  I have seen water like it at the Filter-shops, \nbut nowhere else.\n\nOn the fourth night after leaving Louisville, we reached St. Louis, \nand here I witnessed the conclusion of an incident, trifling enough \nin itself, but very pleasant to see, which had interested me during \nthe whole journey.\n\nThere was a little woman on board, with a little baby; and both \nlittle woman and little child were cheerful, good-looking, bright-\neyed, and fair to see.  The little woman had been passing a long \ntime with her sick mother in New York, and had left her home in St. \nLouis, in that condition in which ladies who truly love their lords \ndesire to be.  The baby was born in her mother\'s house; and she had \nnot seen her husband (to whom she was now returning), for twelve \nmonths:  having left him a month or two after their marriage.\n\nWell, to be sure, there never was a little woman so full of hope, \nand tenderness, and love, and anxiety, as this little woman was:  \nand all day long she wondered whether \'He\' would be at the wharf; \nand whether \'He\' had got her letter; and whether, if she sent the \nbaby ashore by somebody else, \'He\' would know it, meeting it in the \nstreet:  which, seeing that he had never set eyes upon it in his \nlife, was not very likely in the abstract, but was probable enough, \nto the young mother.  She was such an artless little creature; and \nwas in such a sunny, beaming, hopeful state; and let out all this \nmatter clinging close about her heart, so freely; that all the \nother lady passengers entered into the spirit of it as much as she; \nand the captain (who heard all about it from his wife) was wondrous \nsly, I promise you:  inquiring, every time we met at table, as in \nforgetfulness, whether she expected anybody to meet her at St. \nLouis, and whether she would want to go ashore the night we reached \nit (but he supposed she wouldn\'t), and cutting many other dry jokes \nof that nature.  There was one little weazen, dried-apple-faced old \nwoman, who took occasion to doubt the constancy of husbands in such \ncircumstances of bereavement; and there was another lady (with a \nlap-dog) old enough to moralize on the lightness of human \naffections, and yet not so old that she could help nursing the \nbaby, now and then, or laughing with the rest, when the little \nwoman called it by its father\'s name, and asked it all manner of \nfantastic questions concerning him in the joy of her heart.\n\nIt was something of a blow to the little woman, that when we were \nwithin twenty miles of our destination, it became clearly necessary \nto put this baby to bed.  But she got over it with the same good \nhumour; tied a handkerchief round her head; and came out into the \nlittle gallery with the rest.  Then, such an oracle as she became \nin reference to the localities! and such facetiousness as was \ndisplayed by the married ladies! and such sympathy as was shown by \nthe single ones! and such peals of laughter as the little woman \nherself (who would just as soon have cried) greeted every jest \nwith!\n\nAt last, there were the lights of St. Louis, and here was the \nwharf, and those were the steps:  and the little woman covering her \nface with her hands, and laughing (or seeming to laugh) more than \never, ran into her own cabin, and shut herself up.  I have no doubt \nthat in the charming inconsistency of such excitement, she stopped \nher ears, lest she should hear \'Him\' asking for her:  but I did not \nsee her do it.\n\nThen, a great crowd of people rushed on board, though the boat was \nnot yet made fast, but was wandering about, among the other boats, \nto find a landing-place:  and everybody looked for the husband:  \nand nobody saw him:  when, in the midst of us all - Heaven knows \nhow she ever got there - there was the little woman clinging with \nboth arms tight round the neck of a fine, good-looking, sturdy \nyoung fellow! and in a moment afterwards, there she was again, \nactually clapping her little hands for joy, as she dragged him \nthrough the small door of her small cabin, to look at the baby as \nhe lay asleep!\n\nWe went to a large hotel, called the Planter\'s House:  built like \nan English hospital, with long passages and bare walls, and sky-\nlights above the room-doors for the free circulation of air.  There \nwere a great many boarders in it; and as many lights sparkled and \nglistened from the windows down into the street below, when we \ndrove up, as if it had been illuminated on some occasion of \nrejoicing.  It is an excellent house, and the proprietors have most \nbountiful notions of providing the creature comforts.  Dining alone \nwith my wife in our own room, one day, I counted fourteen dishes on \nthe table at once.\n\nIn the old French portion of the town, the thoroughfares are narrow \nand crooked, and some of the houses are very quaint and \npicturesque:  being built of wood, with tumble-down galleries \nbefore the windows, approachable by stairs or rather ladders from \nthe street.  There are queer little barbers\' shops and drinking-\nhouses too, in this quarter; and abundance of crazy old tenements \nwith blinking casements, such as may be seen in Flanders.  Some of \nthese ancient habitations, with high garret gable-windows perking \ninto the roofs, have a kind of French shrug about them; and being \nlop-sided with age, appear to hold their heads askew, besides, as \nif they were grimacing in astonishment at the American \nImprovements.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to say, that these consist of wharfs and \nwarehouses, and new buildings in all directions; and of a great \nmany vast plans which are still \'progressing.\'  Already, however, \nsome very good houses, broad streets, and marble-fronted shops, \nhave gone so far ahead as to be in a state of completion; and the \ntown bids fair in a few years to improve considerably:  though it \nis not likely ever to vie, in point of elegance or beauty, with \nCincinnati.\n\nThe Roman Catholic religion, introduced here by the early French \nsettlers, prevails extensively.  Among the public institutions are \na Jesuit college; a convent for \'the Ladies of the Sacred Heart;\' \nand a large chapel attached to the college, which was in course of \nerection at the time of my visit, and was intended to be \nconsecrated on the second of December in the next year.  The \narchitect of this building, is one of the reverend fathers of the \nschool, and the works proceed under his sole direction.  The organ \nwill be sent from Belgium.\n\nIn addition to these establishments, there is a Roman Catholic \ncathedral, dedicated to Saint Francis Xavier; and a hospital, \nfounded by the munificence of a deceased resident, who was a member \nof that church.  It also sends missionaries from hence among the \nIndian tribes.\n\nThe Unitarian church is represented, in this remote place, as in \nmost other parts of America, by a gentleman of great worth and \nexcellence.  The poor have good reason to remember and bless it; \nfor it befriends them, and aids the cause of rational education, \nwithout any sectarian or selfish views.  It is liberal in all its \nactions; of kind construction; and of wide benevolence.\n\nThere are three free-schools already erected, and in full operation \nin this city.  A fourth is building, and will soon be opened.\n\nNo man ever admits the unhealthiness of the place he dwells in \n(unless he is going away from it), and I shall therefore, I have no \ndoubt, be at issue with the inhabitants of St. Louis, in \nquestioning the perfect salubrity of its climate, and in hinting \nthat I think it must rather dispose to fever, in the summer and \nautumnal seasons.  Just adding, that it is very hot, lies among \ngreat rivers, and has vast tracts of undrained swampy land around \nit, I leave the reader to form his own opinion.\n\nAs I had a great desire to see a Prairie before turning back from \nthe furthest point of my wanderings; and as some gentlemen of the \ntown had, in their hospitable consideration, an equal desire to \ngratify me; a day was fixed, before my departure, for an expedition \nto the Looking-Glass Prairie, which is within thirty miles of the \ntown.  Deeming it possible that my readers may not object to know \nwhat kind of thing such a gipsy party may be at that distance from \nhome, and among what sort of objects it moves, I will describe the \njaunt in another chapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII - A JAUNT TO THE LOOKING-GLASS PRAIRIE AND BACK\n\n\n\nI MAY premise that the word Prairie is variously pronounced \nPARAAER, PAREARER, PAROARER.  The latter mode of pronunciation is \nperhaps the most in favour.\n\nWe were fourteen in all, and all young men:  indeed it is a \nsingular though very natural feature in the society of these \ndistant settlements, that it is mainly composed of adventurous \npersons in the prime of life, and has very few grey heads among it.  \nThere were no ladies:  the trip being a fatiguing one:  and we were \nto start at five o\'clock in the morning punctually.\n\nI was called at four, that I might be certain of keeping nobody \nwaiting; and having got some bread and milk for breakfast, threw up \nthe window and looked down into the street, expecting to see the \nwhole party busily astir, and great preparations going on below.  \nBut as everything was very quiet, and the street presented that \nhopeless aspect with which five o\'clock in the morning is familiar \nelsewhere, I deemed it as well to go to bed again, and went \naccordingly.\n\nI woke again at seven o\'clock, and by that time the party had \nassembled, and were gathered round, one light carriage, with a very \nstout axletree; one something on wheels like an amateur carrier\'s \ncart; one double phaeton of great antiquity and unearthly \nconstruction; one gig with a great hole in its back and a broken \nhead; and one rider on horseback who was to go on before.  I got \ninto the first coach with three companions; the rest bestowed \nthemselves in the other vehicles; two large baskets were made fast \nto the lightest; two large stone jars in wicker cases, technically \nknown as demi-johns, were consigned to the \'least rowdy\' of the \nparty for safe-keeping; and the procession moved off to the \nferryboat, in which it was to cross the river bodily, men, horses, \ncarriages, and all, as the manner in these parts is.\n\nWe got over the river in due course, and mustered again before a \nlittle wooden box on wheels, hove down all aslant in a morass, with \n\'MERCHANT TAILOR\' painted in very large letters over the door.  \nHaving settled the order of proceeding, and the road to be taken, \nwe started off once more and began to make our way through an ill-\nfavoured Black Hollow, called, less expressively, the American \nBottom.\n\nThe previous day had been - not to say hot, for the term is weak \nand lukewarm in its power of conveying an idea of the temperature.  \nThe town had been on fire; in a blaze.  But at night it had come on \nto rain in torrents, and all night long it had rained without \ncessation.  We had a pair of very strong horses, but travelled at \nthe rate of little more than a couple of miles an hour, through one \nunbroken slough of black mud and water.  It had no variety but in \ndepth.  Now it was only half over the wheels, now it hid the \naxletree, and now the coach sank down in it almost to the windows.  \nThe air resounded in all directions with the loud chirping of the \nfrogs, who, with the pigs (a coarse, ugly breed, as unwholesome-\nlooking as though they were the spontaneous growth of the country), \nhad the whole scene to themselves.  Here and there we passed a log \nhut:  but the wretched cabins were wide apart and thinly scattered, \nfor though the soil is very rich in this place, few people can \nexist in such a deadly atmosphere.  On either side of the track, if \nit deserve the name, was the thick \'bush;\' and everywhere was \nstagnant, slimy, rotten, filthy water.\n\nAs it is the custom in these parts to give a horse a gallon or so \nof cold water whenever he is in a foam with heat, we halted for \nthat purpose, at a log inn in the wood, far removed from any other \nresidence.  It consisted of one room, bare-roofed and bare-walled \nof course, with a loft above.  The ministering priest was a swarthy \nyoung savage, in a shirt of cotton print like bed-furniture, and a \npair of ragged trousers.  There were a couple of young boys, too, \nnearly naked, lying idle by the well; and they, and he, and THE \ntraveller at the inn, turned out to look at us.\n\nThe traveller was an old man with a grey gristly beard two inches \nlong, a shaggy moustache of the same hue, and enormous eyebrows; \nwhich almost obscured his lazy, semi-drunken glance, as he stood \nregarding us with folded arms:  poising himself alternately upon \nhis toes and heels.  On being addressed by one of the party, he \ndrew nearer, and said, rubbing his chin (which scraped under his \nhorny hand like fresh gravel beneath a nailed shoe), that he was \nfrom Delaware, and had lately bought a farm \'down there,\' pointing \ninto one of the marshes where the stunted trees were thickest.  He \nwas \'going,\' he added, to St. Louis, to fetch his family, whom he \nhad left behind; but he seemed in no great hurry to bring on these \nincumbrances, for when we moved away, he loitered back into the \ncabin, and was plainly bent on stopping there so long as his money \nlasted.  He was a great politician of course, and explained his \nopinions at some length to one of our company; but I only remember \nthat he concluded with two sentiments, one of which was, Somebody \nfor ever; and the other, Blast everybody else! which is by no means \na bad abstract of the general creed in these matters.\n\nWhen the horses were swollen out to about twice their natural \ndimensions (there seems to be an idea here, that this kind of \ninflation improves their going), we went forward again, through mud \nand mire, and damp, and festering heat, and brake and bush, \nattended always by the music of the frogs and pigs, until nearly \nnoon, when we halted at a place called Belleville.\n\nBelleville was a small collection of wooden houses, huddled \ntogether in the very heart of the bush and swamp.  Many of them had \nsingularly bright doors of red and yellow; for the place had been \nlately visited by a travelling painter, \'who got along,\' as I was \ntold, \'by eating his way.\'  The criminal court was sitting, and was \nat that moment trying some criminals for horse-stealing:  with whom \nit would most likely go hard:  for live stock of all kinds being \nnecessarily very much exposed in the woods, is held by the \ncommunity in rather higher value than human life; and for this \nreason, juries generally make a point of finding all men indicted \nfor cattle-stealing, guilty, whether or no.\n\nThe horses belonging to the bar, the judge, and witnesses, were \ntied to temporary racks set up roughly in the road; by which is to \nbe understood, a forest path, nearly knee-deep in mud and slime.\n\nThere was an hotel in this place, which, like all hotels in \nAmerica, had its large dining-room for the public table.  It was an \nodd, shambling, low-roofed out-house, half-cowshed and half-\nkitchen, with a coarse brown canvas table-cloth, and tin sconces \nstuck against the walls, to hold candles at supper-time.  The \nhorseman had gone forward to have coffee and some eatables \nprepared, and they were by this time nearly ready.  He had ordered \n\'wheat-bread and chicken fixings,\' in preference to \'corn-bread and \ncommon doings.\'  The latter kind of rejection includes only pork \nand bacon.  The former comprehends broiled ham, sausages, veal \ncutlets, steaks, and such other viands of that nature as may be \nsupposed, by a tolerably wide poetical construction, \'to fix\' a \nchicken comfortably in the digestive organs of any lady or \ngentleman.\n\nOn one of the door-posts at this inn, was a tin plate, whereon was \ninscribed in characters of gold, \'Doctor Crocus;\' and on a sheet of \npaper, pasted up by the side of this plate, was a written \nannouncement that Dr. Crocus would that evening deliver a lecture \non Phrenology for the benefit of the Belleville public; at a \ncharge, for admission, of so much a head.\n\nStraying up-stairs, during the preparation of the chicken fixings, \nI happened to pass the doctor\'s chamber; and as the door stood wide \nopen, and the room was empty, I made bold to peep in.\n\nIt was a bare, unfurnished, comfortless room, with an unframed \nportrait hanging up at the head of the bed; a likeness, I take it, \nof the Doctor, for the forehead was fully displayed, and great \nstress was laid by the artist upon its phrenological developments.  \nThe bed itself was covered with an old patch-work counterpane.  The \nroom was destitute of carpet or of curtain.  There was a damp \nfireplace without any stove, full of wood ashes; a chair, and a \nvery small table; and on the last-named piece of furniture was \ndisplayed, in grand array, the doctor\'s library, consisting of some \nhalf-dozen greasy old books.\n\nNow, it certainly looked about the last apartment on the whole \nearth out of which any man would be likely to get anything to do \nhim good.  But the door, as I have said, stood coaxingly open, and \nplainly said in conjunction with the chair, the portrait, the \ntable, and the books, \'Walk in, gentlemen, walk in!  Don\'t be ill, \ngentlemen, when you may be well in no time.  Doctor Crocus is here, \ngentlemen, the celebrated Dr. Crocus!  Dr. Crocus has come all this \nway to cure you, gentlemen.  If you haven\'t heard of Dr. Crocus, \nit\'s your fault, gentlemen, who live a little way out of the world \nhere:  not Dr. Crocus\'s.  Walk in, gentlemen, walk in!\'\n\nIn the passage below, when I went down-stairs again, was Dr. Crocus \nhimself.  A crowd had flocked in from the Court House, and a voice \nfrom among them called out to the landlord, \'Colonel! introduce \nDoctor Crocus.\'\n\n\'Mr. Dickens,\' says the colonel, \'Doctor Crocus.\'\n\nUpon which Doctor Crocus, who is a tall, fine-looking Scotchman, \nbut rather fierce and warlike in appearance for a professor of the \npeaceful art of healing, bursts out of the concourse with his right \narm extended, and his chest thrown out as far as it will possibly \ncome, and says:\n\n\'Your countryman, sir!\'\n\nWhereupon Doctor Crocus and I shake hands; and Doctor Crocus looks \nas if I didn\'t by any means realise his expectations, which, in a \nlinen blouse, and a great straw hat, with a green ribbon, and no \ngloves, and my face and nose profusely ornamented with the stings \nof mosquitoes and the bites of bugs, it is very likely I did not.\n\n\'Long in these parts, sir?\' says I.\n\n\'Three or four months, sir,\' says the Doctor.\n\n\'Do you think of soon returning to the old country?\' says I.\n\nDoctor Crocus makes no verbal answer, but gives me an imploring \nlook, which says so plainly \'Will you ask me that again, a little \nlouder, if you please?\' that I repeat the question.\n\n\'Think of soon returning to the old country, sir!\' repeats the \nDoctor.\n\n\'To the old country, sir,\' I rejoin.\n\nDoctor Crocus looks round upon the crowd to observe the effect he \nproduces, rubs his hands, and says, in a very loud voice:\n\n\'Not yet awhile, sir, not yet.  You won\'t catch me at that just \nyet, sir.  I am a little too fond of freedom for THAT, sir.  Ha, \nha!  It\'s not so easy for a man to tear himself from a free country \nsuch as this is, sir.  Ha, ha!  No, no!  Ha, ha!  None of that till \none\'s obliged to do it, sir.  No, no!\'\n\nAs Doctor Crocus says these latter words, he shakes his head, \nknowingly, and laughs again.  Many of the bystanders shake their \nheads in concert with the doctor, and laugh too, and look at each \nother as much as to say, \'A pretty bright and first-rate sort of \nchap is Crocus!\' and unless I am very much mistaken, a good many \npeople went to the lecture that night, who never thought about \nphrenology, or about Doctor Crocus either, in all their lives \nbefore.\n\nFrom Belleville, we went on, through the same desolate kind of \nwaste, and constantly attended, without the interval of a moment, \nby the same music; until, at three o\'clock in the afternoon, we \nhalted once more at a village called Lebanon to inflate the horses \nagain, and give them some corn besides:  of which they stood much \nin need.  Pending this ceremony, I walked into the village, where I \nmet a full-sized dwelling-house coming down-hill at a round trot, \ndrawn by a score or more of oxen.\n\nThe public-house was so very clean and good a one, that the \nmanagers of the jaunt resolved to return to it and put up there for \nthe night, if possible.  This course decided on, and the horses \nbeing well refreshed, we again pushed forward, and came upon the \nPrairie at sunset.\n\nIt would be difficult to say why, or how - though it was possibly \nfrom having heard and read so much about it - but the effect on me \nwas disappointment.  Looking towards the setting sun, there lay, \nstretched out before my view, a vast expanse of level ground; \nunbroken, save by one thin line of trees, which scarcely amounted \nto a scratch upon the great blank; until it met the glowing sky, \nwherein it seemed to dip:  mingling with its rich colours, and \nmellowing in its distant blue.  There it lay, a tranquil sea or \nlake without water, if such a simile be admissible, with the day \ngoing down upon it:  a few birds wheeling here and there:  and \nsolitude and silence reigning paramount around.  But the grass was \nnot yet high; there were bare black patches on the ground; and the \nfew wild flowers that the eye could see, were poor and scanty.  \nGreat as the picture was, its very flatness and extent, which left \nnothing to the imagination, tamed it down and cramped its interest.  \nI felt little of that sense of freedom and exhilaration which a \nScottish heath inspires, or even our English downs awaken.  It was \nlonely and wild, but oppressive in its barren monotony.  I felt \nthat in traversing the Prairies, I could never abandon myself to \nthe scene, forgetful of all else; as I should do instinctively, \nwere the heather underneath my feet, or an iron-bound coast beyond; \nbut should often glance towards the distant and frequently-receding \nline of the horizon, and wish it gained and passed.  It is not a \nscene to be forgotten, but it is scarcely one, I think (at all \nevents, as I saw it), to remember with much pleasure, or to covet \nthe looking-on again, in after-life.\n\nWe encamped near a solitary log-house, for the sake of its water, \nand dined upon the plain.  The baskets contained roast fowls, \nbuffalo\'s tongue (an exquisite dainty, by the way), ham, bread, \ncheese, and butter; biscuits, champagne, sherry; lemons and sugar \nfor punch; and abundance of rough ice.  The meal was delicious, and \nthe entertainers were the soul of kindness and good humour.  I have \noften recalled that cheerful party to my pleasant recollection \nsince, and shall not easily forget, in junketings nearer home with \nfriends of older date, my boon companions on the Prairie.\n\nReturning to Lebanon that night, we lay at the little inn at which \nwe had halted in the afternoon.  In point of cleanliness and \ncomfort it would have suffered by no comparison with any English \nalehouse, of a homely kind, in England.\n\nRising at five o\'clock next morning, I took a walk about the \nvillage:  none of the houses were strolling about to-day, but it \nwas early for them yet, perhaps:  and then amused myself by \nlounging in a kind of farm-yard behind the tavern, of which the \nleading features were, a strange jumble of rough sheds for stables; \na rude colonnade, built as a cool place of summer resort; a deep \nwell; a great earthen mound for keeping vegetables in, in winter \ntime; and a pigeon-house, whose little apertures looked, as they do \nin all pigeon-houses, very much too small for the admission of the \nplump and swelling-breasted birds who were strutting about it, \nthough they tried to get in never so hard.  That interest \nexhausted, I took a survey of the inn\'s two parlours, which were \ndecorated with coloured prints of Washington, and President \nMadison, and of a white-faced young lady (much speckled by the \nflies), who held up her gold neck-chain for the admiration of the \nspectator, and informed all admiring comers that she was \'Just \nSeventeen:\' although I should have thought her older.  In the best \nroom were two oil portraits of the kit-cat size, representing the \nlandlord and his infant son; both looking as bold as lions, and \nstaring out of the canvas with an intensity that would have been \ncheap at any price.  They were painted, I think, by the artist who \nhad touched up the Belleville doors with red and gold; for I seemed \nto recognise his style immediately.\n\nAfter breakfast, we started to return by a different way from that \nwhich we had taken yesterday, and coming up at ten o\'clock with an \nencampment of German emigrants carrying their goods in carts, who \nhad made a rousing fire which they were just quitting, stopped \nthere to refresh.  And very pleasant the fire was; for, hot though \nit had been yesterday, it was quite cold to-day, and the wind blew \nkeenly.  Looming in the distance, as we rode along, was another of \nthe ancient Indian burial-places, called The Monks\' Mound; in \nmemory of a body of fanatics of the order of La Trappe, who founded \na desolate convent there, many years ago, when there were no \nsettlers within a thousand miles, and were all swept off by the \npernicious climate:  in which lamentable fatality, few rational \npeople will suppose, perhaps, that society experienced any very \nsevere deprivation.\n\nThe track of to-day had the same features as the track of \nyesterday.  There was the swamp, the bush, and the perpetual chorus \nof frogs, the rank unseemly growth, the unwholesome steaming earth.  \nHere and there, and frequently too, we encountered a solitary \nbroken-down waggon, full of some new settler\'s goods.  It was a \npitiful sight to see one of these vehicles deep in the mire; the \naxle-tree broken; the wheel lying idly by its side; the man gone \nmiles away, to look for assistance; the woman seated among their \nwandering household gods with a baby at her breast, a picture of \nforlorn, dejected patience; the team of oxen crouching down \nmournfully in the mud, and breathing forth such clouds of vapour \nfrom their mouths and nostrils, that all the damp mist and fog \naround seemed to have come direct from them.\n\nIn due time we mustered once again before the merchant tailor\'s, \nand having done so, crossed over to the city in the ferry-boat:  \npassing, on the way, a spot called Bloody Island, the duelling-\nground of St. Louis, and so designated in honour of the last fatal \ncombat fought there, which was with pistols, breast to breast.  \nBoth combatants fell dead upon the ground; and possibly some \nrational people may think of them, as of the gloomy madmen on the \nMonks\' Mound, that they were no great loss to the community.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV - RETURN TO CINCINNATI.  A STAGE-COACH RIDE FROM THAT \nCITY TO COLUMBUS, AND THENCE TO SANDUSKY.  SO, BY LAKE ERIE, TO THE \nFALLS OF NIAGARA\n\n\n\nAS I had a desire to travel through the interior of the state of \nOhio, and to \'strike the lakes,\' as the phrase is, at a small town \ncalled Sandusky, to which that route would conduct us on our way to \nNiagara, we had to return from St. Louis by the way we had come, \nand to retrace our former track as far as Cincinnati.\n\nThe day on which we were to take leave of St. Louis being very \nfine; and the steamboat, which was to have started I don\'t know how \nearly in the morning, postponing, for the third or fourth time, her \ndeparture until the afternoon; we rode forward to an old French \nvillage on the river, called properly Carondelet, and nicknamed \nVide Poche, and arranged that the packet should call for us there.\n\nThe place consisted of a few poor cottages, and two or three \npublic-houses; the state of whose larders certainly seemed to \njustify the second designation of the village, for there was \nnothing to eat in any of them.  At length, however, by going back \nsome half a mile or so, we found a solitary house where ham and \ncoffee were procurable; and there we tarried to wait the advent of \nthe boat, which would come in sight from the green before the door, \na long way off.\n\nIt was a neat, unpretending village tavern, and we took our repast \nin a quaint little room with a bed in it, decorated with some old \noil paintings, which in their time had probably done duty in a \nCatholic chapel or monastery.  The fare was very good, and served \nwith great cleanliness.  The house was kept by a characteristic old \ncouple, with whom we had a long talk, and who were perhaps a very \ngood sample of that kind of people in the West.\n\nThe landlord was a dry, tough, hard-faced old fellow (not so very \nold either, for he was but just turned sixty, I should think), who \nhad been out with the militia in the last war with England, and had \nseen all kinds of service, - except a battle; and he had been very \nnear seeing that, he added:  very near.  He had all his life been \nrestless and locomotive, with an irresistible desire for change; \nand was still the son of his old self:  for if he had nothing to \nkeep him at home, he said (slightly jerking his hat and his thumb \ntowards the window of the room in which the old lady sat, as we \nstood talking in front of the house), he would clean up his musket, \nand be off to Texas to-morrow morning.  He was one of the very many \ndescendants of Cain proper to this continent, who seem destined \nfrom their birth to serve as pioneers in the great human army:  who \ngladly go on from year to year extending its outposts, and leaving \nhome after home behind them; and die at last, utterly regardless of \ntheir graves being left thousands of miles behind, by the wandering \ngeneration who succeed.\n\nHis wife was a domesticated, kind-hearted old soul, who had come \nwith him, \'from the queen city of the world,\' which, it seemed, was \nPhiladelphia; but had no love for this Western country, and indeed \nhad little reason to bear it any; having seen her children, one by \none, die here of fever, in the full prime and beauty of their \nyouth.  Her heart was sore, she said, to think of them; and to talk \non this theme, even to strangers, in that blighted place, so far \nfrom her old home, eased it somewhat, and became a melancholy \npleasure.\n\nThe boat appearing towards evening, we bade adieu to the poor old \nlady and her vagrant spouse, and making for the nearest landing-\nplace, were soon on board The Messenger again, in our old cabin, \nand steaming down the Mississippi.\n\nIf the coming up this river, slowly making head against the stream, \nbe an irksome journey, the shooting down it with the turbid current \nis almost worse; for then the boat, proceeding at the rate of \ntwelve or fifteen miles an hour, has to force its passage through a \nlabyrinth of floating logs, which, in the dark, it is often \nimpossible to see beforehand or avoid.  All that night, the bell \nwas never silent for five minutes at a time; and after every ring \nthe vessel reeled again, sometimes beneath a single blow, sometimes \nbeneath a dozen dealt in quick succession, the lightest of which \nseemed more than enough to beat in her frail keel, as though it had \nbeen pie-crust.  Looking down upon the filthy river after dark, it \nseemed to be alive with monsters, as these black masses rolled upon \nthe surface, or came starting up again, head first, when the boat, \nin ploughing her way among a shoal of such obstructions, drove a \nfew among them for the moment under water.  Sometimes the engine \nstopped during a long interval, and then before her and behind, and \ngathering close about her on all sides, were so many of these ill-\nfavoured obstacles that she was fairly hemmed in; the centre of a \nfloating island; and was constrained to pause until they parted, \nsomewhere, as dark clouds will do before the wind, and opened by \ndegrees a channel out.\n\nIn good time next morning, however, we came again in sight of the \ndetestable morass called Cairo; and stopping there to take in wood, \nlay alongside a barge, whose starting timbers scarcely held \ntogether.  It was moored to the bank, and on its side was painted \n\'Coffee House;\' that being, I suppose, the floating paradise to \nwhich the people fly for shelter when they lose their houses for a \nmonth or two beneath the hideous waters of the Mississippi.  But \nlooking southward from this point, we had the satisfaction of \nseeing that intolerable river dragging its slimy length and ugly \nfreight abruptly off towards New Orleans; and passing a yellow line \nwhich stretched across the current, were again upon the clear Ohio, \nnever, I trust, to see the Mississippi more, saving in troubled \ndreams and nightmares.  Leaving it for the company of its sparkling \nneighbour, was like the transition from pain to ease, or the \nawakening from a horrible vision to cheerful realities.\n\nWe arrived at Louisville on the fourth night, and gladly availed \nourselves of its excellent hotel.  Next day we went on in the Ben \nFranklin, a beautiful mail steamboat, and reached Cincinnati \nshortly after midnight.  Being by this time nearly tired of \nsleeping upon shelves, we had remained awake to go ashore \nstraightway; and groping a passage across the dark decks of other \nboats, and among labyrinths of engine-machinery and leaking casks \nof molasses, we reached the streets, knocked up the porter at the \nhotel where we had stayed before, and were, to our great joy, \nsafely housed soon afterwards.\n\nWe rested but one day at Cincinnati, and then resumed our journey \nto Sandusky.  As it comprised two varieties of stage-coach \ntravelling, which, with those I have already glanced at, comprehend \nthe main characteristics of this mode of transit in America, I will \ntake the reader as our fellow-passenger, and pledge myself to \nperform the distance with all possible despatch.\n\nOur place of destination in the first instance is Columbus.  It is \ndistant about a hundred and twenty miles from Cincinnati, but there \nis a macadamised road (rare blessing!) the whole way, and the rate \nof travelling upon it is six miles an hour.\n\nWe start at eight o\'clock in the morning, in a great mail-coach, \nwhose huge cheeks are so very ruddy and plethoric, that it appears \nto be troubled with a tendency of blood to the head.  Dropsical it \ncertainly is, for it will hold a dozen passengers inside.  But, \nwonderful to add, it is very clean and bright, being nearly new; \nand rattles through the streets of Cincinnati gaily.\n\nOur way lies through a beautiful country, richly cultivated, and \nluxuriant in its promise of an abundant harvest.  Sometimes we pass \na field where the strong bristling stalks of Indian corn look like \na crop of walking-sticks, and sometimes an enclosure where the \ngreen wheat is springing up among a labyrinth of stumps; the \nprimitive worm-fence is universal, and an ugly thing it is; but the \nfarms are neatly kept, and, save for these differences, one might \nbe travelling just now in Kent.\n\nWe often stop to water at a roadside inn, which is always dull and \nsilent.  The coachman dismounts and fills his bucket, and holds it \nto the horses\' heads.  There is scarcely ever any one to help him; \nthere are seldom any loungers standing round; and never any stable-\ncompany with jokes to crack.  Sometimes, when we have changed our \nteam, there is a difficulty in starting again, arising out of the \nprevalent mode of breaking a young horse:  which is to catch him, \nharness him against his will, and put him in a stage-coach without \nfurther notice:  but we get on somehow or other, after a great many \nkicks and a violent struggle; and jog on as before again.\n\nOccasionally, when we stop to change, some two or three half-\ndrunken loafers will come loitering out with their hands in their \npockets, or will be seen kicking their heels in rocking-chairs, or \nlounging on the window-sill, or sitting on a rail within the \ncolonnade:  they have not often anything to say though, either to \nus or to each other, but sit there idly staring at the coach and \nhorses.  The landlord of the inn is usually among them, and seems, \nof all the party, to be the least connected with the business of \nthe house.  Indeed he is with reference to the tavern, what the \ndriver is in relation to the coach and passengers:  whatever \nhappens in his sphere of action, he is quite indifferent, and \nperfectly easy in his mind.\n\nThe frequent change of coachmen works no change or variety in the \ncoachman\'s character.  He is always dirty, sullen, and taciturn.  \nIf he be capable of smartness of any kind, moral or physical, he \nhas a faculty of concealing it which is truly marvellous.  He never \nspeaks to you as you sit beside him on the box, and if you speak to \nhim, he answers (if at all) in monosyllables.  He points out \nnothing on the road, and seldom looks at anything:  being, to all \nappearance, thoroughly weary of it and of existence generally.  As \nto doing the honours of his coach, his business, as I have said, is \nwith the horses.  The coach follows because it is attached to them \nand goes on wheels:  not because you are in it.  Sometimes, towards \nthe end of a long stage, he suddenly breaks out into a discordant \nfragment of an election song, but his face never sings along with \nhim:  it is only his voice, and not often that.\n\nHe always chews and always spits, and never encumbers himself with \na pocket-handkerchief.  The consequences to the box passenger, \nespecially when the wind blows towards him, are not agreeable.\n\nWhenever the coach stops, and you can hear the voices of the inside \npassengers; or whenever any bystander addresses them, or any one \namong them; or they address each other; you will hear one phrase \nrepeated over and over and over again to the most extraordinary \nextent.  It is an ordinary and unpromising phrase enough, being \nneither more nor less than \'Yes, sir;\' but it is adapted to every \nvariety of circumstance, and fills up every pause in the \nconversation.  Thus:-\n\nThe time is one o\'clock at noon.  The scene, a place where we are \nto stay and dine, on this journey.  The coach drives up to the door \nof an inn.  The day is warm, and there are several idlers lingering \nabout the tavern, and waiting for the public dinner.  Among them, \nis a stout gentleman in a brown hat, swinging himself to and fro in \na rocking-chair on the pavement.\n\nAs the coach stops, a gentleman in a straw hat looks out of the \nwindow:\n\nSTRAW HAT.  (To the stout gentleman in the rocking-chair.)  I \nreckon that\'s Judge Jefferson, an\'t it?\n\nBROWN HAT.  (Still swinging; speaking very slowly; and without any \nemotion whatever.)  Yes, sir.\n\nSTRAW HAT.  Warm weather, Judge.\n\nBROWN HAT.  Yes, sir.\n\nSTRAW HAT.  There was a snap of cold, last week.\n\nBROWN HAT.  Yes, sir.\n\nSTRAW HAT.  Yes, sir.\n\nA pause.  They look at each other, very seriously.\n\nSTRAW HAT.  I calculate you\'ll have got through that case of the \ncorporation, Judge, by this time, now?\n\nBROWN HAT.  Yes, sir.\n\nSTRAW HAT.  How did the verdict go, sir?\n\nBROWN HAT.  For the defendant, sir.\n\nSTRAW HAT.  (Interrogatively.)  Yes, sir?\n\nBROWN HAT. (Affirmatively.)  Yes, sir.\n\nBOTH.  (Musingly, as each gazes down the street.)  Yes, sir.\n\nAnother pause.  They look at each other again, still more seriously \nthan before.\n\nBROWN HAT.  This coach is rather behind its time to-day, I guess.\n\nSTRAW HAT.  (Doubtingly.)  Yes, sir.\n\nBROWN HAT.  (Looking at his watch.)  Yes, sir; nigh upon two hours.\n\nSTRAW HAT.  (Raising his eyebrows in very great surprise.)  Yes, \nsir!\n\nBROWN HAT.  (Decisively, as he puts up his watch.)  Yes, sir.\n\nALL THE OTHER INSIDE PASSENGERS.  (Among themselves.)  Yes, sir.\n\nCOACHMAN.  (In a very surly tone.)  No it an\'t.\n\nSTRAW HAT.  (To the coachman.)  Well, I don\'t know, sir.  We were a \npretty tall time coming that last fifteen mile.  That\'s a fact.\n\nThe coachman making no reply, and plainly declining to enter into \nany controversy on a subject so far removed from his sympathies and \nfeelings, another passenger says, \'Yes, sir;\' and the gentleman in \nthe straw hat in acknowledgment of his courtesy, says \'Yes, sir,\' \nto him, in return.  The straw hat then inquires of the brown hat, \nwhether that coach in which he (the straw hat) then sits, is not a \nnew one?  To which the brown hat again makes answer, \'Yes, sir.\'\n\nSTRAW HAT.  I thought so.  Pretty loud smell of varnish, sir?\n\nBROWN HAT.  Yes, sir.\n\nALL THE OTHER INSIDE PASSENGERS.  Yes, sir.\n\nBROWN HAT.  (To the company in general.)  Yes, sir.\n\nThe conversational powers of the company having been by this time \npretty heavily taxed, the straw hat opens the door and gets out; \nand all the rest alight also.  We dine soon afterwards with the \nboarders in the house, and have nothing to drink but tea and \ncoffee.  As they are both very bad and the water is worse, I ask \nfor brandy; but it is a Temperance Hotel, and spirits are not to be \nhad for love or money.  This preposterous forcing of unpleasant \ndrinks down the reluctant throats of travellers is not at all \nuncommon in America, but I never discovered that the scruples of \nsuch wincing landlords induced them to preserve any unusually nice \nbalance between the quality of their fare, and their scale of \ncharges:  on the contrary, I rather suspected them of diminishing \nthe one and exalting the other, by way of recompense for the loss \nof their profit on the sale of spirituous liquors.  After all, \nperhaps, the plainest course for persons of such tender \nconsciences, would be, a total abstinence from tavern-keeping.\n\nDinner over, we get into another vehicle which is ready at the door \n(for the coach has been changed in the interval), and resume our \njourney; which continues through the same kind of country until \nevening, when we come to the town where we are to stop for tea and \nsupper; and having delivered the mail bags at the Post-office, ride \nthrough the usual wide street, lined with the usual stores and \nhouses (the drapers always having hung up at their door, by way of \nsign, a piece of bright red cloth), to the hotel where this meal is \nprepared.  There being many boarders here, we sit down, a large \nparty, and a very melancholy one as usual.  But there is a buxom \nhostess at the head of the table, and opposite, a simple Welsh \nschoolmaster with his wife and child; who came here, on a \nspeculation of greater promise than performance, to teach the \nclassics:  and they are sufficient subjects of interest until the \nmeal is over, and another coach is ready.  In it we go on once \nmore, lighted by a bright moon, until midnight; when we stop to \nchange the coach again, and remain for half an hour or so in a \nmiserable room, with a blurred lithograph of Washington over the \nsmoky fire-place, and a mighty jug of cold water on the table:  to \nwhich refreshment the moody passengers do so apply themselves that \nthey would seem to be, one and all, keen patients of Dr. Sangrado.  \nAmong them is a very little boy, who chews tobacco like a very big \none; and a droning gentleman, who talks arithmetically and \nstatistically on all subjects, from poetry downwards; and who \nalways speaks in the same key, with exactly the same emphasis, and \nwith very grave deliberation.  He came outside just now, and told \nme how that the uncle of a certain young lady who had been spirited \naway and married by a certain captain, lived in these parts; and \nhow this uncle was so valiant and ferocious that he shouldn\'t \nwonder if he were to follow the said captain to England, \'and shoot \nhim down in the street wherever he found him;\' in the feasibility \nof which strong measure I, being for the moment rather prone to \ncontradiction, from feeling half asleep and very tired, declined to \nacquiesce:  assuring him that if the uncle did resort to it, or \ngratified any other little whim of the like nature, he would find \nhimself one morning prematurely throttled at the Old Bailey:  and \nthat he would do well to make his will before he went, as he would \ncertainly want it before he had been in Britain very long.\n\nOn we go, all night, and by-and-by the day begins to break, and \npresently the first cheerful rays of the warm sun come slanting on \nus brightly.  It sheds its light upon a miserable waste of sodden \ngrass, and dull trees, and squalid huts, whose aspect is forlorn \nand grievous in the last degree.  A very desert in the wood, whose \ngrowth of green is dank and noxious like that upon the top of \nstanding water:  where poisonous fungus grows in the rare footprint \non the oozy ground, and sprouts like witches\' coral, from the \ncrevices in the cabin wall and floor; it is a hideous thing to lie \nupon the very threshold of a city.  But it was purchased years ago, \nand as the owner cannot be discovered, the State has been unable to \nreclaim it.  So there it remains, in the midst of cultivation and \nimprovement, like ground accursed, and made obscene and rank by \nsome great crime.\n\nWe reached Columbus shortly before seven o\'clock, and stayed there, \nto refresh, that day and night:  having excellent apartments in a \nvery large unfinished hotel called the Neill House, which were \nrichly fitted with the polished wood of the black walnut, and \nopened on a handsome portico and stone verandah, like rooms in some \nItalian mansion.  The town is clean and pretty, and of course is \n\'going to be\' much larger.  It is the seat of the State legislature \nof Ohio, and lays claim, in consequence, to some consideration and \nimportance.\n\nThere being no stage-coach next day, upon the road we wished to \ntake, I hired \'an extra,\' at a reasonable charge to carry us to \nTiffin; a small town from whence there is a railroad to Sandusky.  \nThis extra was an ordinary four-horse stage-coach, such as I have \ndescribed, changing horses and drivers, as the stage-coach would, \nbut was exclusively our own for the journey.  To ensure our having \nhorses at the proper stations, and being incommoded by no \nstrangers, the proprietors sent an agent on the box, who was to \naccompany us the whole way through; and thus attended, and bearing \nwith us, besides, a hamper full of savoury cold meats, and fruit, \nand wine, we started off again in high spirits, at half-past six \no\'clock next morning, very much delighted to be by ourselves, and \ndisposed to enjoy even the roughest journey.\n\nIt was well for us, that we were in this humour, for the road we \nwent over that day, was certainly enough to have shaken tempers \nthat were not resolutely at Set Fair, down to some inches below \nStormy.  At one time we were all flung together in a heap at the \nbottom of the coach, and at another we were crushing our heads \nagainst the roof.  Now, one side was down deep in the mire, and we \nwere holding on to the other.  Now, the coach was lying on the \ntails of the two wheelers; and now it was rearing up in the air, in \na frantic state, with all four horses standing on the top of an \ninsurmountable eminence, looking coolly back at it, as though they \nwould say \'Unharness us.  It can\'t be done.\'  The drivers on these \nroads, who certainly get over the ground in a manner which is quite \nmiraculous, so twist and turn the team about in forcing a passage, \ncorkscrew fashion, through the bogs and swamps, that it was quite a \ncommon circumstance on looking out of the window, to see the \ncoachman with the ends of a pair of reins in his hands, apparently \ndriving nothing, or playing at horses, and the leaders staring at \none unexpectedly from the back of the coach, as if they had some \nidea of getting up behind.  A great portion of the way was over \nwhat is called a corduroy road, which is made by throwing trunks of \ntrees into a marsh, and leaving them to settle there.  The very \nslightest of the jolts with which the ponderous carriage fell from \nlog to log, was enough, it seemed, to have dislocated all the bones \nin the human body.  It would be impossible to experience a similar \nset of sensations, in any other circumstances, unless perhaps in \nattempting to go up to the top of St. Paul\'s in an omnibus.  Never, \nnever once, that day, was the coach in any position, attitude, or \nkind of motion to which we are accustomed in coaches.  Never did it \nmake the smallest approach to one\'s experience of the proceedings \nof any sort of vehicle that goes on wheels.\n\nStill, it was a fine day, and the temperature was delicious, and \nthough we had left Summer behind us in the west, and were fast \nleaving Spring, we were moving towards Niagara and home.  We \nalighted in a pleasant wood towards the middle of the day, dined on \na fallen tree, and leaving our best fragments with a cottager, and \nour worst with the pigs (who swarm in this part of the country like \ngrains of sand on the sea-shore, to the great comfort of our \ncommissariat in Canada), we went forward again, gaily.\n\nAs night came on, the track grew narrower and narrower, until at \nlast it so lost itself among the trees, that the driver seemed to \nfind his way by instinct.  We had the comfort of knowing, at least, \nthat there was no danger of his falling asleep, for every now and \nthen a wheel would strike against an unseen stump with such a jerk, \nthat he was fain to hold on pretty tight and pretty quick, to keep \nhimself upon the box.  Nor was there any reason to dread the least \ndanger from furious driving, inasmuch as over that broken ground \nthe horses had enough to do to walk; as to shying, there was no \nroom for that; and a herd of wild elephants could not have run away \nin such a wood, with such a coach at their heels.  So we stumbled \nalong, quite satisfied.\n\nThese stumps of trees are a curious feature in American travelling.  \nThe varying illusions they present to the unaccustomed eye as it \ngrows dark, are quite astonishing in their number and reality.  \nNow, there is a Grecian urn erected in the centre of a lonely \nfield; now there is a woman weeping at a tomb; now a very \ncommonplace old gentleman in a white waistcoat, with a thumb thrust \ninto each arm-hole of his coat; now a student poring on a book; now \na crouching negro; now, a horse, a dog, a cannon, an armed man; a \nhunch-back throwing off his cloak and stepping forth into the \nlight.  They were often as entertaining to me as so many glasses in \na magic lantern, and never took their shapes at my bidding, but \nseemed to force themselves upon me, whether I would or no; and \nstrange to say, I sometimes recognised in them counterparts of \nfigures once familiar to me in pictures attached to childish books, \nforgotten long ago.\n\nIt soon became too dark, however, even for this amusement, and the \ntrees were so close together that their dry branches rattled \nagainst the coach on either side, and obliged us all to keep our \nheads within.  It lightened too, for three whole hours; each flash \nbeing very bright, and blue, and long; and as the vivid streaks \ncame darting in among the crowded branches, and the thunder rolled \ngloomily above the tree tops, one could scarcely help thinking that \nthere were better neighbourhoods at such a time than thick woods \nafforded.\n\nAt length, between ten and eleven o\'clock at night, a few feeble \nlights appeared in the distance, and Upper Sandusky, an Indian \nvillage, where we were to stay till morning, lay before us.\n\nThey were gone to bed at the log Inn, which was the only house of \nentertainment in the place, but soon answered to our knocking, and \ngot some tea for us in a sort of kitchen or common room, tapestried \nwith old newspapers, pasted against the wall.  The bed-chamber to \nwhich my wife and I were shown, was a large, low, ghostly room; \nwith a quantity of withered branches on the hearth, and two doors \nwithout any fastening, opposite to each other, both opening on the \nblack night and wild country, and so contrived, that one of them \nalways blew the other open:  a novelty in domestic architecture, \nwhich I do not remember to have seen before, and which I was \nsomewhat disconcerted to have forced on my attention after getting \ninto bed, as I had a considerable sum in gold for our travelling \nexpenses, in my dressing-case.  Some of the luggage, however, piled \nagainst the panels, soon settled this difficulty, and my sleep \nwould not have been very much affected that night, I believe, \nthough it had failed to do so.\n\nMy Boston friend climbed up to bed, somewhere in the roof, where \nanother guest was already snoring hugely.  But being bitten beyond \nhis power of endurance, he turned out again, and fled for shelter \nto the coach, which was airing itself in front of the house.  This \nwas not a very politic step, as it turned out; for the pigs \nscenting him, and looking upon the coach as a kind of pie with some \nmanner of meat inside, grunted round it so hideously, that he was \nafraid to come out again, and lay there shivering, till morning.  \nNor was it possible to warm him, when he did come out, by means of \na glass of brandy:  for in Indian villages, the legislature, with a \nvery good and wise intention, forbids the sale of spirits by tavern \nkeepers.  The precaution, however, is quite inefficacious, for the \nIndians never fail to procure liquor of a worse kind, at a dearer \nprice, from travelling pedlars.\n\nIt is a settlement of the Wyandot Indians who inhabit this place.  \nAmong the company at breakfast was a mild old gentleman, who had \nbeen for many years employed by the United States Government in \nconducting negotiations with the Indians, and who had just \nconcluded a treaty with these people by which they bound \nthemselves, in consideration of a certain annual sum, to remove \nnext year to some land provided for them, west of the Mississippi, \nand a little way beyond St. Louis.  He gave me a moving account of \ntheir strong attachment to the familiar scenes of their infancy, \nand in particular to the burial-places of their kindred; and of \ntheir great reluctance to leave them.  He had witnessed many such \nremovals, and always with pain, though he knew that they departed \nfor their own good.  The question whether this tribe should go or \nstay, had been discussed among them a day or two before, in a hut \nerected for the purpose, the logs of which still lay upon the \nground before the inn.  When the speaking was done, the ayes and \nnoes were ranged on opposite sides, and every male adult voted in \nhis turn.  The moment the result was known, the minority (a large \none) cheerfully yielded to the rest, and withdrew all kind of \nopposition.\n\nWe met some of these poor Indians afterwards, riding on shaggy \nponies.  They were so like the meaner sort of gipsies, that if I \ncould have seen any of them in England, I should have concluded, as \na matter of course, that they belonged to that wandering and \nrestless people.\n\nLeaving this town directly after breakfast, we pushed forward \nagain, over a rather worse road than yesterday, if possible, and \narrived about noon at Tiffin, where we parted with the extra.  At \ntwo o\'clock we took the railroad; the travelling on which was very \nslow, its construction being indifferent, and the ground wet and \nmarshy; and arrived at Sandusky in time to dine that evening.  We \nput up at a comfortable little hotel on the brink of Lake Erie, lay \nthere that night, and had no choice but to wait there next day, \nuntil a steamboat bound for Buffalo appeared.  The town, which was \nsluggish and uninteresting enough, was something like the back of \nan English watering-place, out of the season.\n\nOur host, who was very attentive and anxious to make us \ncomfortable, was a handsome middle-aged man, who had come to this \ntown from New England, in which part of the country he was \n\'raised.\'  When I say that he constantly walked in and out of the \nroom with his hat on; and stopped to converse in the same free-and-\neasy state; and lay down on our sofa, and pulled his newspaper out \nof his pocket, and read it at his ease; I merely mention these \ntraits as characteristic of the country:  not at all as being \nmatter of complaint, or as having been disagreeable to me.  I \nshould undoubtedly be offended by such proceedings at home, because \nthere they are not the custom, and where they are not, they would \nbe impertinencies; but in America, the only desire of a good-\nnatured fellow of this kind, is to treat his guests hospitably and \nwell; and I had no more right, and I can truly say no more \ndisposition, to measure his conduct by our English rule and \nstandard, than I had to quarrel with him for not being of the exact \nstature which would qualify him for admission into the Queen\'s \ngrenadier guards.  As little inclination had I to find fault with a \nfunny old lady who was an upper domestic in this establishment, and \nwho, when she came to wait upon us at any meal, sat herself down \ncomfortably in the most convenient chair, and producing a large pin \nto pick her teeth with, remained performing that ceremony, and \nsteadfastly regarding us meanwhile with much gravity and composure \n(now and then pressing us to eat a little more), until it was time \nto clear away.  It was enough for us, that whatever we wished done \nwas done with great civility and readiness, and a desire to oblige, \nnot only here, but everywhere else; and that all our wants were, in \ngeneral, zealously anticipated.\n\nWe were taking an early dinner at this house, on the day after our \narrival, which was Sunday, when a steamboat came in sight, and \npresently touched at the wharf.  As she proved to be on her way to \nBuffalo, we hurried on board with all speed, and soon left Sandusky \nfar behind us.\n\nShe was a large vessel of five hundred tons, and handsomely fitted \nup, though with high-pressure engines; which always conveyed that \nkind of feeling to me, which I should be likely to experience, I \nthink, if I had lodgings on the first-floor of a powder-mill.  She \nwas laden with flour, some casks of which commodity were stored \nupon the deck.  The captain coming up to have a little \nconversation, and to introduce a friend, seated himself astride of \none of these barrels, like a Bacchus of private life; and pulling a \ngreat clasp-knife out of his pocket, began to \'whittle\' it as he \ntalked, by paring thin slices off the edges.  And he whittled with \nsuch industry and hearty good will, that but for his being called \naway very soon, it must have disappeared bodily, and left nothing \nin its place but grist and shavings.\n\nAfter calling at one or two flat places, with low dams stretching \nout into the lake, whereon were stumpy lighthouses, like windmills \nwithout sails, the whole looking like a Dutch vignette, we came at \nmidnight to Cleveland, where we lay all night, and until nine \no\'clock next morning.\n\nI entertained quite a curiosity in reference to this place, from \nhaving seen at Sandusky a specimen of its literature in the shape \nof a newspaper, which was very strong indeed upon the subject of \nLord Ashburton\'s recent arrival at Washington, to adjust the points \nin dispute between the United States Government and Great Britain:  \ninforming its readers that as America had \'whipped\' England in her \ninfancy, and whipped her again in her youth, so it was clearly \nnecessary that she must whip her once again in her maturity; and \npledging its credit to all True Americans, that if Mr. Webster did \nhis duty in the approaching negotiations, and sent the English Lord \nhome again in double quick time, they should, within two years, \nsing \'Yankee Doodle in Hyde Park, and Hail Columbia in the scarlet \ncourts of Westminster!\'  I found it a pretty town, and had the \nsatisfaction of beholding the outside of the office of the journal \nfrom which I have just quoted.  I did not enjoy the delight of \nseeing the wit who indited the paragraph in question, but I have no \ndoubt he is a prodigious man in his way, and held in high repute by \na select circle.\n\nThere was a gentleman on board, to whom, as I unintentionally \nlearned through the thin partition which divided our state-room \nfrom the cabin in which he and his wife conversed together, I was \nunwittingly the occasion of very great uneasiness.  I don\'t know \nwhy or wherefore, but I appeared to run in his mind perpetually, \nand to dissatisfy him very much.  First of all I heard him say:  \nand the most ludicrous part of the business was, that he said it in \nmy very ear, and could not have communicated more directly with me, \nif he had leaned upon my shoulder, and whispered me:  \'Boz is on \nboard still, my dear.\'  After a considerable pause, he added, \ncomplainingly, \'Boz keeps himself very close;\' which was true \nenough, for I was not very well, and was lying down, with a book.  \nI thought he had done with me after this, but I was deceived; for a \nlong interval having elapsed, during which I imagine him to have \nbeen turning restlessly from side to side, and trying to go to \nsleep; he broke out again, with \'I suppose THAT Boz will be writing \na book by-and-by, and putting all our names in it!\' at which \nimaginary consequence of being on board a boat with Boz, he \ngroaned, and became silent.\n\nWe called at the town of Erie, at eight o\'clock that night, and lay \nthere an hour.  Between five and six next morning, we arrived at \nBuffalo, where we breakfasted; and being too near the Great Falls \nto wait patiently anywhere else, we set off by the train, the same \nmorning at nine o\'clock, to Niagara.\n\nIt was a miserable day; chilly and raw; a damp mist falling; and \nthe trees in that northern region quite bare and wintry.  Whenever \nthe train halted, I listened for the roar; and was constantly \nstraining my eyes in the direction where I knew the Falls must be, \nfrom seeing the river rolling on towards them; every moment \nexpecting to behold the spray.  Within a few minutes of our \nstopping, not before, I saw two great white clouds rising up slowly \nand majestically from the depths of the earth.  That was all.  At \nlength we alighted:  and then for the first time, I heard the \nmighty rush of water, and felt the ground tremble underneath my \nfeet.\n\nThe bank is very steep, and was slippery with rain, and half-melted \nice.  I hardly know how I got down, but I was soon at the bottom, \nand climbing, with two English officers who were crossing and had \njoined me, over some broken rocks, deafened by the noise, half-\nblinded by the spray, and wet to the skin.  We were at the foot of \nthe American Fall.  I could see an immense torrent of water tearing \nheadlong down from some great height, but had no idea of shape, or \nsituation, or anything but vague immensity.\n\nWhen we were seated in the little ferry-boat, and were crossing the \nswollen river immediately before both cataracts, I began to feel \nwhat it was:  but I was in a manner stunned, and unable to \ncomprehend the vastness of the scene.  It was not until I came on \nTable Rock, and looked - Great Heaven, on what a fall of bright-\ngreen water! - that it came upon me in its full might and majesty.\n\nThen, when I felt how near to my Creator I was standing, the first \neffect, and the enduring one - instant and lasting - of the \ntremendous spectacle, was Peace.  Peace of Mind, tranquillity, calm \nrecollections of the Dead, great thoughts of Eternal Rest and \nHappiness:  nothing of gloom or terror.  Niagara was at once \nstamped upon my heart, an Image of Beauty; to remain there, \nchangeless and indelible, until its pulses cease to beat, for ever.\n\nOh, how the strife and trouble of daily life receded from my view, \nand lessened in the distance, during the ten memorable days we \npassed on that Enchanted Ground!  What voices spoke from out the \nthundering water; what faces, faded from the earth, looked out upon \nme from its gleaming depths; what Heavenly promise glistened in \nthose angels\' tears, the drops of many hues, that showered around, \nand twined themselves about the gorgeous arches which the changing \nrainbows made!\n\nI never stirred in all that time from the Canadian side, whither I \nhad gone at first.  I never crossed the river again; for I knew \nthere were people on the other shore, and in such a place it is \nnatural to shun strange company.  To wander to and fro all day, and \nsee the cataracts from all points of view; to stand upon the edge \nof the great Horse-Shoe Fall, marking the hurried water gathering \nstrength as it approached the verge, yet seeming, too, to pause \nbefore it shot into the gulf below; to gaze from the river\'s level \nup at the torrent as it came streaming down; to climb the \nneighbouring heights and watch it through the trees, and see the \nwreathing water in the rapids hurrying on to take its fearful \nplunge; to linger in the shadow of the solemn rocks three miles \nbelow; watching the river as, stirred by no visible cause, it \nheaved and eddied and awoke the echoes, being troubled yet, far \ndown beneath the surface, by its giant leap; to have Niagara before \nme, lighted by the sun and by the moon, red in the day\'s decline, \nand grey as evening slowly fell upon it; to look upon it every day, \nand wake up in the night and hear its ceaseless voice:  this was \nenough.\n\nI think in every quiet season now, still do those waters roll and \nleap, and roar and tumble, all day long; still are the rainbows \nspanning them, a hundred feet below.  Still, when the sun is on \nthem, do they shine and glow like molten gold.  Still, when the day \nis gloomy, do they fall like snow, or seem to crumble away like the \nfront of a great chalk cliff, or roll down the rock like dense \nwhite smoke.  But always does the mighty stream appear to die as it \ncomes down, and always from its unfathomable grave arises that \ntremendous ghost of spray and mist which is never laid:  which has \nhaunted this place with the same dread solemnity since Darkness \nbrooded on the deep, and that first flood before the Deluge - Light \n- came rushing on Creation at the word of God.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV - IN CANADA; TORONTO; KINGSTON; MONTREAL; QUEBEC; ST. \nJOHN\'S.  IN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN; LEBANON; THE SHAKER VILLAGE; \nWEST POINT\n\n\n\nI wish to abstain from instituting any comparison, or drawing any \nparallel whatever, between the social features of the United States \nand those of the British Possessions in Canada.  For this reason, I \nshall confine myself to a very brief account of our journeyings in \nthe latter territory.\n\nBut before I leave Niagara, I must advert to one disgusting \ncircumstance which can hardly have escaped the observation of any \ndecent traveller who has visited the Falls.\n\nOn Table Rock, there is a cottage belonging to a Guide, where \nlittle relics of the place are sold, and where visitors register \ntheir names in a book kept for the purpose.  On the wall of the \nroom in which a great many of these volumes are preserved, the \nfollowing request is posted:  \'Visitors will please not copy nor \nextract the remarks and poetical effusions from the registers and \nalbums kept here.\'\n\nBut for this intimation, I should have let them lie upon the tables \non which they were strewn with careful negligence, like books in a \ndrawing-room:  being quite satisfied with the stupendous silliness \nof certain stanzas with an anti-climax at the end of each, which \nwere framed and hung up on the wall.  Curious, however, after \nreading this announcement, to see what kind of morsels were so \ncarefully preserved, I turned a few leaves, and found them scrawled \nall over with the vilest and the filthiest ribaldry that ever human \nhogs delighted in.\n\nIt is humiliating enough to know that there are among men brutes so \nobscene and worthless, that they can delight in laying their \nmiserable profanations upon the very steps of Nature\'s greatest \naltar.  But that these should be hoarded up for the delight of \ntheir fellow-swine, and kept in a public place where any eyes may \nsee them, is a disgrace to the English language in which they are \nwritten (though I hope few of these entries have been made by \nEnglishmen), and a reproach to the English side, on which they are \npreserved.\n\nThe quarters of our soldiers at Niagara, are finely and airily \nsituated.  Some of them are large detached houses on the plain \nabove the Falls, which were originally designed for hotels; and in \nthe evening time, when the women and children were leaning over the \nbalconies watching the men as they played at ball and other games \nupon the grass before the door, they often presented a little \npicture of cheerfulness and animation which made it quite a \npleasure to pass that way.\n\nAt any garrisoned point where the line of demarcation between one \ncountry and another is so very narrow as at Niagara, desertion from \nthe ranks can scarcely fail to be of frequent occurrence:  and it \nmay be reasonably supposed that when the soldiers entertain the \nwildest and maddest hopes of the fortune and independence that \nawait them on the other side, the impulse to play traitor, which \nsuch a place suggests to dishonest minds, is not weakened.  But it \nvery rarely happens that the men who do desert, are happy or \ncontented afterwards; and many instances have been known in which \nthey have confessed their grievous disappointment, and their \nearnest desire to return to their old service if they could but be \nassured of pardon, or lenient treatment.  Many of their comrades, \nnotwithstanding, do the like, from time to time; and instances of \nloss of life in the effort to cross the river with this object, are \nfar from being uncommon.  Several men were drowned in the attempt \nto swim across, not long ago; and one, who had the madness to trust \nhimself upon a table as a raft, was swept down to the whirlpool, \nwhere his mangled body eddied round and round some days.\n\nI am inclined to think that the noise of the Falls is very much \nexaggerated; and this will appear the more probable when the depth \nof the great basin in which the water is received, is taken into \naccount.  At no time during our stay there, was the wind at all \nhigh or boisterous, but we never heard them, three miles off, even \nat the very quiet time of sunset, though we often tried.\n\nQueenston, at which place the steamboats start for Toronto (or I \nshould rather say at which place they call, for their wharf is at \nLewiston, on the opposite shore), is situated in a delicious \nvalley, through which the Niagara river, in colour a very deep \ngreen, pursues its course.  It is approached by a road that takes \nits winding way among the heights by which the town is sheltered; \nand seen from this point is extremely beautiful and picturesque.  \nOn the most conspicuous of these heights stood a monument erected \nby the Provincial Legislature in memory of General Brock, who was \nslain in a battle with the American forces, after having won the \nvictory.  Some vagabond, supposed to be a fellow of the name of \nLett, who is now, or who lately was, in prison as a felon, blew up \nthis monument two years ago, and it is now a melancholy ruin, with \na long fragment of iron railing hanging dejectedly from its top, \nand waving to and fro like a wild ivy branch or broken vine stem.  \nIt is of much higher importance than it may seem, that this statue \nshould be repaired at the public cost, as it ought to have been \nlong ago.  Firstly, because it is beneath the dignity of England to \nallow a memorial raised in honour of one of her defenders, to \nremain in this condition, on the very spot where he died.  \nSecondly, because the sight of it in its present state, and the \nrecollection of the unpunished outrage which brought it to this \npass, is not very likely to soothe down border feelings among \nEnglish subjects here, or compose their border quarrels and \ndislikes.\n\nI was standing on the wharf at this place, watching the passengers \nembarking in a steamboat which preceded that whose coming we \nawaited, and participating in the anxiety with which a sergeant\'s \nwife was collecting her few goods together - keeping one distracted \neye hard upon the porters, who were hurrying them on board, and the \nother on a hoopless washing-tub for which, as being the most \nutterly worthless of all her movables, she seemed to entertain \nparticular affection - when three or four soldiers with a recruit \ncame up and went on board.\n\nThe recruit was a likely young fellow enough, strongly built and \nwell made, but by no means sober:  indeed he had all the air of a \nman who had been more or less drunk for some days.  He carried a \nsmall bundle over his shoulder, slung at the end of a walking-\nstick, and had a short pipe in his mouth.  He was as dusty and \ndirty as recruits usually are, and his shoes betokened that he had \ntravelled on foot some distance, but he was in a very jocose state, \nand shook hands with this soldier, and clapped that one on the \nback, and talked and laughed continually, like a roaring idle dog \nas he was.\n\nThe soldiers rather laughed at this blade than with him:  seeming \nto say, as they stood straightening their canes in their hands, and \nlooking coolly at him over their glazed stocks, \'Go on, my boy, \nwhile you may! you\'ll know better by-and-by:\' when suddenly the \nnovice, who had been backing towards the gangway in his noisy \nmerriment, fell overboard before their eyes, and splashed heavily \ndown into the river between the vessel and the dock.\n\nI never saw such a good thing as the change that came over these \nsoldiers in an instant.  Almost before the man was down, their \nprofessional manner, their stiffness and constraint, were gone, and \nthey were filled with the most violent energy.  In less time than \nis required to tell it, they had him out again, feet first, with \nthe tails of his coat flapping over his eyes, everything about him \nhanging the wrong way, and the water streaming off at every thread \nin his threadbare dress.  But the moment they set him upright and \nfound that he was none the worse, they were soldiers again, looking \nover their glazed stocks more composedly than ever.\n\nThe half-sobered recruit glanced round for a moment, as if his \nfirst impulse were to express some gratitude for his preservation, \nbut seeing them with this air of total unconcern, and having his \nwet pipe presented to him with an oath by the soldier who had been \nby far the most anxious of the party, he stuck it in his mouth, \nthrust his hands into his moist pockets, and without even shaking \nthe water off his clothes, walked on board whistling; not to say as \nif nothing had happened, but as if he had meant to do it, and it \nhad been a perfect success.\n\nOur steamboat came up directly this had left the wharf, and soon \nbore us to the mouth of the Niagara; where the stars and stripes of \nAmerica flutter on one side and the Union Jack of England on the \nother:  and so narrow is the space between them that the sentinels \nin either fort can often hear the watchword of the other country \ngiven.  Thence we emerged on Lake Ontario, an inland sea; and by \nhalf-past six o\'clock were at Toronto.\n\nThe country round this town being very flat, is bare of scenic \ninterest; but the town itself is full of life and motion, bustle, \nbusiness, and improvement.  The streets are well paved, and lighted \nwith gas; the houses are large and good; the shops excellent.  Many \nof them have a display of goods in their windows, such as may be \nseen in thriving county towns in England; and there are some which \nwould do no discredit to the metropolis itself.  There is a good \nstone prison here; and there are, besides, a handsome church, a \ncourt-house, public offices, many commodious private residences, \nand a government observatory for noting and recording the magnetic \nvariations.  In the College of Upper Canada, which is one of the \npublic establishments of the city, a sound education in every \ndepartment of polite learning can be had, at a very moderate \nexpense:  the annual charge for the instruction of each pupil, not \nexceeding nine pounds sterling.  It has pretty good endowments in \nthe way of land, and is a valuable and useful institution.\n\nThe first stone of a new college had been laid but a few days \nbefore, by the Governor General.  It will be a handsome, spacious \nedifice, approached by a long avenue, which is already planted and \nmade available as a public walk.  The town is well adapted for \nwholesome exercise at all seasons, for the footways in the \nthoroughfares which lie beyond the principal street, are planked \nlike floors, and kept in very good and clean repair.\n\nIt is a matter of deep regret that political differences should \nhave run high in this place, and led to most discreditable and \ndisgraceful results.  It is not long since guns were discharged \nfrom a window in this town at the successful candidates in an \nelection, and the coachman of one of them was actually shot in the \nbody, though not dangerously wounded.  But one man was killed on \nthe same occasion; and from the very window whence he received his \ndeath, the very flag which shielded his murderer (not only in the \ncommission of his crime, but from its consequences), was displayed \nagain on the occasion of the public ceremony performed by the \nGovernor General, to which I have just adverted.  Of all the \ncolours in the rainbow, there is but one which could be so \nemployed:  I need not say that flag was orange.\n\nThe time of leaving Toronto for Kingston is noon.  By eight o\'clock \nnext morning, the traveller is at the end of his journey, which is \nperformed by steamboat upon Lake Ontario, calling at Port Hope and \nCoburg, the latter a cheerful, thriving little town.  Vast \nquantities of flour form the chief item in the freight of these \nvessels.  We had no fewer than one thousand and eighty barrels on \nboard, between Coburg and Kingston.\n\nThe latter place, which is now the seat of government in Canada, is \na very poor town, rendered still poorer in the appearance of its \nmarket-place by the ravages of a recent fire.  Indeed, it may be \nsaid of Kingston, that one half of it appears to be burnt down, and \nthe other half not to be built up.  The Government House is neither \nelegant nor commodious, yet it is almost the only house of any \nimportance in the neighbourhood.\n\nThere is an admirable jail here, well and wisely governed, and \nexcellently regulated, in every respect.  The men were employed as \nshoemakers, ropemakers, blacksmiths, tailors, carpenters, and \nstonecutters; and in building a new prison, which was pretty far \nadvanced towards completion.  The female prisoners were occupied in \nneedlework.  Among them was a beautiful girl of twenty, who had \nbeen there nearly three years.  She acted as bearer of secret \ndespatches for the self-styled Patriots on Navy Island, during the \nCanadian Insurrection:  sometimes dressing as a girl, and carrying \nthem in her stays; sometimes attiring herself as a boy, and \nsecreting them in the lining of her hat.  In the latter character \nshe always rode as a boy would, which was nothing to her, for she \ncould govern any horse that any man could ride, and could drive \nfour-in-hand with the best whip in those parts.  Setting forth on \none of her patriotic missions, she appropriated to herself the \nfirst horse she could lay her hands on; and this offence had \nbrought her where I saw her.  She had quite a lovely face, though, \nas the reader may suppose from this sketch of her history, there \nwas a lurking devil in her bright eye, which looked out pretty \nsharply from between her prison bars.\n\nThere is a bomb-proof fort here of great strength, which occupies a \nbold position, and is capable, doubtless, of doing good service; \nthough the town is much too close upon the frontier to be long \nheld, I should imagine, for its present purpose in troubled times.  \nThere is also a small navy-yard, where a couple of Government \nsteamboats were building, and getting on vigorously.\n\nWe left Kingston for Montreal on the tenth of May, at half-past \nnine in the morning, and proceeded in a steamboat down the St. \nLawrence river.  The beauty of this noble stream at almost any \npoint, but especially in the commencement of this journey when it \nwinds its way among the thousand Islands, can hardly be imagined.  \nThe number and constant successions of these islands, all green and \nrichly wooded; their fluctuating sizes, some so large that for half \nan hour together one among them will appear as the opposite bank of \nthe river, and some so small that they are mere dimples on its \nbroad bosom; their infinite variety of shapes; and the numberless \ncombinations of beautiful forms which the trees growing on them \npresent:  all form a picture fraught with uncommon interest and \npleasure.\n\nIn the afternoon we shot down some rapids where the river boiled \nand bubbled strangely, and where the force and headlong violence of \nthe current were tremendous.  At seven o\'clock we reached \nDickenson\'s Landing, whence travellers proceed for two or three \nhours by stage-coach:  the navigation of the river being rendered \nso dangerous and difficult in the interval, by rapids, that \nsteamboats do not make the passage.  The number and length of those \nPORTAGES, over which the roads are bad, and the travelling slow, \nrender the way between the towns of Montreal and Kingston, somewhat \ntedious.\n\nOur course lay over a wide, uninclosed tract of country at a little \ndistance from the river-side, whence the bright warning lights on \nthe dangerous parts of the St. Lawrence shone vividly.  The night \nwas dark and raw, and the way dreary enough.  It was nearly ten \no\'clock when we reached the wharf where the next steamboat lay; and \nwent on board, and to bed.\n\nShe lay there all night, and started as soon as it was day.  The \nmorning was ushered in by a violent thunderstorm, and was very wet, \nbut gradually improved and brightened up.  Going on deck after \nbreakfast, I was amazed to see floating down with the stream, a \nmost gigantic raft, with some thirty or forty wooden houses upon \nit, and at least as many flag-masts, so that it looked like a \nnautical street.  I saw many of these rafts afterwards, but never \none so large.  All the timber, or \'lumber,\' as it is called in \nAmerica, which is brought down the St. Lawrence, is floated down in \nthis manner.  When the raft reaches its place of destination, it is \nbroken up; the materials are sold; and the boatmen return for more.\n\nAt eight we landed again, and travelled by a stage-coach for four \nhours through a pleasant and well-cultivated country, perfectly \nFrench in every respect:  in the appearance of the cottages; the \nair, language, and dress of the peasantry; the sign-boards on the \nshops and taverns:  and the Virgin\'s shrines, and crosses, by the \nwayside.  Nearly every common labourer and boy, though he had no \nshoes to his feet, wore round his waist a sash of some bright \ncolour:  generally red:  and the women, who were working in the \nfields and gardens, and doing all kinds of husbandry, wore, one and \nall, great flat straw hats with most capacious brims.  There were \nCatholic Priests and Sisters of Charity in the village streets; and \nimages of the Saviour at the corners of cross-roads, and in other \npublic places.\n\nAt noon we went on board another steamboat, and reached the village \nof Lachine, nine miles from Montreal, by three o\'clock.  There, we \nleft the river, and went on by land.\n\nMontreal is pleasantly situated on the margin of the St. Lawrence, \nand is backed by some bold heights, about which there are charming \nrides and drives.  The streets are generally narrow and irregular, \nas in most French towns of any age; but in the more modern parts of \nthe city, they are wide and airy.  They display a great variety of \nvery good shops; and both in the town and suburbs there are many \nexcellent private dwellings.  The granite quays are remarkable for \ntheir beauty, solidity, and extent.\n\nThere is a very large Catholic cathedral here, recently erected \nwith two tall spires, of which one is yet unfinished.  In the open \nspace in front of this edifice, stands a solitary, grim-looking, \nsquare brick tower, which has a quaint and remarkable appearance, \nand which the wiseacres of the place have consequently determined \nto pull down immediately.  The Government House is very superior to \nthat at Kingston, and the town is full of life and bustle.  In one \nof the suburbs is a plank road - not footpath - five or six miles \nlong, and a famous road it is too.  All the rides in the vicinity \nwere made doubly interesting by the bursting out of spring, which \nis here so rapid, that it is but a day\'s leap from barren winter, \nto the blooming youth of summer.\n\nThe steamboats to Quebec perform the journey in the night; that is \nto say, they leave Montreal at six in the evening, and arrive at \nQuebec at six next morning.  We made this excursion during our stay \nin Montreal (which exceeded a fortnight), and were charmed by its \ninterest and beauty.\n\nThe impression made upon the visitor by this Gibraltar of America:  \nits giddy heights; its citadel suspended, as it were, in the air; \nits picturesque steep streets and frowning gateways; and the \nsplendid views which burst upon the eye at every turn:  is at once \nunique and lasting.\n\nIt is a place not to be forgotten or mixed up in the mind with \nother places, or altered for a moment in the crowd of scenes a \ntraveller can recall.  Apart from the realities of this most \npicturesque city, there are associations clustering about it which \nwould make a desert rich in interest.  The dangerous precipice \nalong whose rocky front, Wolfe and his brave companions climbed to \nglory; the Plains of Abraham, where he received his mortal wound; \nthe fortress so chivalrously defended by Montcalm; and his \nsoldier\'s grave, dug for him while yet alive, by the bursting of a \nshell; are not the least among them, or among the gallant incidents \nof history.  That is a noble Monument too, and worthy of two great \nnations, which perpetuates the memory of both brave generals, and \non which their names are jointly written.\n\nThe city is rich in public institutions and in Catholic churches \nand charities, but it is mainly in the prospect from the site of \nthe Old Government House, and from the Citadel, that its surpassing \nbeauty lies.  The exquisite expanse of country, rich in field and \nforest, mountain-height and water, which lies stretched out before \nthe view, with miles of Canadian villages, glancing in long white \nstreaks, like veins along the landscape; the motley crowd of \ngables, roofs, and chimney tops in the old hilly town immediately \nat hand; the beautiful St. Lawrence sparkling and flashing in the \nsunlight; and the tiny ships below the rock from which you gaze, \nwhose distant rigging looks like spiders\' webs against the light, \nwhile casks and barrels on their decks dwindle into toys, and busy \nmariners become so many puppets; all this, framed by a sunken \nwindow in the fortress and looked at from the shadowed room within, \nforms one of the brightest and most enchanting pictures that the \neye can rest upon.\n\nIn the spring of the year, vast numbers of emigrants who have newly \narrived from England or from Ireland, pass between Quebec and \nMontreal on their way to the backwoods and new settlements of \nCanada.  If it be an entertaining lounge (as I very often found it) \nto take a morning stroll upon the quay at Montreal, and see them \ngrouped in hundreds on the public wharfs about their chests and \nboxes, it is matter of deep interest to be their fellow-passenger \non one of these steamboats, and mingling with the concourse, see \nand hear them unobserved.\n\nThe vessel in which we returned from Quebec to Montreal was crowded \nwith them, and at night they spread their beds between decks (those \nwho had beds, at least), and slept so close and thick about our \ncabin door, that the passage to and fro was quite blocked up.  They \nwere nearly all English; from Gloucestershire the greater part; and \nhad had a long winter-passage out; but it was wonderful to see how \nclean the children had been kept, and how untiring in their love \nand self-denial all the poor parents were.\n\nCant as we may, and as we shall to the end of all things, it is \nvery much harder for the poor to be virtuous than it is for the \nrich; and the good that is in them, shines the brighter for it.  In \nmany a noble mansion lives a man, the best of husbands and of \nfathers, whose private worth in both capacities is justly lauded to \nthe skies.  But bring him here, upon this crowded deck.  Strip from \nhis fair young wife her silken dress and jewels, unbind her braided \nhair, stamp early wrinkles on her brow, pinch her pale cheek with \ncare and much privation, array her faded form in coarsely patched \nattire, let there be nothing but his love to set her forth or deck \nher out, and you shall put it to the proof indeed.  So change his \nstation in the world, that he shall see in those young things who \nclimb about his knee:  not records of his wealth and name:  but \nlittle wrestlers with him for his daily bread; so many poachers on \nhis scanty meal; so many units to divide his every sum of comfort, \nand farther to reduce its small amount.  In lieu of the endearments \nof childhood in its sweetest aspect, heap upon him all its pains \nand wants, its sicknesses and ills, its fretfulness, caprice, and \nquerulous endurance:  let its prattle be, not of engaging infant \nfancies, but of cold, and thirst, and hunger:  and if his fatherly \naffection outlive all this, and he be patient, watchful, tender; \ncareful of his children\'s lives, and mindful always of their joys \nand sorrows; then send him back to Parliament, and Pulpit, and to \nQuarter Sessions, and when he hears fine talk of the depravity of \nthose who live from hand to mouth, and labour hard to do it, let \nhim speak up, as one who knows, and tell those holders forth that \nthey, by parallel with such a class, should be High Angels in their \ndaily lives, and lay but humble siege to Heaven at last.\n\nWhich of us shall say what he would be, if such realities, with \nsmall relief or change all through his days, were his!  Looking \nround upon these people:  far from home, houseless, indigent, \nwandering, weary with travel and hard living:  and seeing how \npatiently they nursed and tended their young children:  how they \nconsulted ever their wants first, then half supplied their own; \nwhat gentle ministers of hope and faith the women were; how the men \nprofited by their example; and how very, very seldom even a \nmoment\'s petulance or harsh complaint broke out among them:  I felt \na stronger love and honour of my kind come glowing on my heart, and \nwished to God there had been many Atheists in the better part of \nhuman nature there, to read this simple lesson in the book of Life.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nWe left Montreal for New York again, on the thirtieth of May, \ncrossing to La Prairie, on the opposite shore of the St. Lawrence, \nin a steamboat; we then took the railroad to St. John\'s, which is \non the brink of Lake Champlain.  Our last greeting in Canada was \nfrom the English officers in the pleasant barracks at that place (a \nclass of gentlemen who had made every hour of our visit memorable \nby their hospitality and friendship); and with \'Rule Britannia\' \nsounding in our ears, soon left it far behind.\n\nBut Canada has held, and always will retain, a foremost place in my \nremembrance.  Few Englishmen are prepared to find it what it is.  \nAdvancing quietly; old differences settling down, and being fast \nforgotten; public feeling and private enterprise alike in a sound \nand wholesome state; nothing of flush or fever in its system, but \nhealth and vigour throbbing in its steady pulse:  it is full of \nhope and promise.  To me - who had been accustomed to think of it \nas something left behind in the strides of advancing society, as \nsomething neglected and forgotten, slumbering and wasting in its \nsleep - the demand for labour and the rates of wages; the busy \nquays of Montreal; the vessels taking in their cargoes, and \ndischarging them; the amount of shipping in the different ports; \nthe commerce, roads, and public works, all made TO LAST; the \nrespectability and character of the public journals; and the amount \nof rational comfort and happiness which honest industry may earn:  \nwere very great surprises.  The steamboats on the lakes, in their \nconveniences, cleanliness, and safety; in the gentlemanly character \nand bearing of their captains; and in the politeness and perfect \ncomfort of their social regulations; are unsurpassed even by the \nfamous Scotch vessels, deservedly so much esteemed at home.  The \ninns are usually bad; because the custom of boarding at hotels is \nnot so general here as in the States, and the British officers, who \nform a large portion of the society of every town, live chiefly at \nthe regimental messes:  but in every other respect, the traveller \nin Canada will find as good provision for his comfort as in any \nplace I know.\n\nThere is one American boat - the vessel which carried us on Lake \nChamplain, from St. John\'s to Whitehall - which I praise very \nhighly, but no more than it deserves, when I say that it is \nsuperior even to that in which we went from Queenston to Toronto, \nor to that in which we travelled from the latter place to Kingston, \nor I have no doubt I may add to any other in the world.  This \nsteamboat, which is called the Burlington, is a perfectly exquisite \nachievement of neatness, elegance, and order.  The decks are \ndrawing-rooms; the cabins are boudoirs, choicely furnished and \nadorned with prints, pictures, and musical instruments; every nook \nand corner in the vessel is a perfect curiosity of graceful comfort \nand beautiful contrivance.  Captain Sherman, her commander, to \nwhose ingenuity and excellent taste these results are solely \nattributable, has bravely and worthily distinguished himself on \nmore than one trying occasion:  not least among them, in having the \nmoral courage to carry British troops, at a time (during the \nCanadian rebellion) when no other conveyance was open to them.  He \nand his vessel are held in universal respect, both by his own \ncountrymen and ours; and no man ever enjoyed the popular esteem, \nwho, in his sphere of action, won and wore it better than this \ngentleman.\n\nBy means of this floating palace we were soon in the United States \nagain, and called that evening at Burlington; a pretty town, where \nwe lay an hour or so.  We reached Whitehall, where we were to \ndisembark, at six next morning; and might have done so earlier, but \nthat these steamboats lie by for some hours in the night, in \nconsequence of the lake becoming very narrow at that part of the \njourney, and difficult of navigation in the dark.  Its width is so \ncontracted at one point, indeed, that they are obliged to warp \nround by means of a rope.\n\nAfter breakfasting at Whitehall, we took the stage-coach for \nAlbany:  a large and busy town, where we arrived between five and \nsix o\'clock that afternoon; after a very hot day\'s journey, for we \nwere now in the height of summer again.  At seven we started for \nNew York on board a great North River steamboat, which was so \ncrowded with passengers that the upper deck was like the box lobby \nof a theatre between the pieces, and the lower one like Tottenham \nCourt Road on a Saturday night.  But we slept soundly, \nnotwithstanding, and soon after five o\'clock next morning reached \nNew York.\n\nTarrying here, only that day and night, to recruit after our late \nfatigues, we started off once more upon our last journey in \nAmerica.  We had yet five days to spare before embarking for \nEngland, and I had a great desire to see \'the Shaker Village,\' \nwhich is peopled by a religious sect from whom it takes its name.\n\nTo this end, we went up the North River again, as far as the town \nof Hudson, and there hired an extra to carry us to Lebanon, thirty \nmiles distant:  and of course another and a different Lebanon from \nthat village where I slept on the night of the Prairie trip.\n\nThe country through which the road meandered, was rich and \nbeautiful; the weather very fine; and for many miles the Kaatskill \nmountains, where Rip Van Winkle and the ghostly Dutchmen played at \nninepins one memorable gusty afternoon, towered in the blue \ndistance, like stately clouds.  At one point, as we ascended a \nsteep hill, athwart whose base a railroad, yet constructing, took \nits course, we came upon an Irish colony.  With means at hand of \nbuilding decent cabins, it was wonderful to see how clumsy, rough, \nand wretched, its hovels were.  The best were poor protection from \nthe weather the worst let in the wind and rain through wide \nbreaches in the roofs of sodden grass, and in the walls of mud; \nsome had neither door nor window; some had nearly fallen down, and \nwere imperfectly propped up by stakes and poles; all were ruinous \nand filthy.  Hideously ugly old women and very buxom young ones, \npigs, dogs, men, children, babies, pots, kettles, dung-hills, vile \nrefuse, rank straw, and standing water, all wallowing together in \nan inseparable heap, composed the furniture of every dark and dirty \nhut.\n\nBetween nine and ten o\'clock at night, we arrived at Lebanon which \nis renowned for its warm baths, and for a great hotel, well \nadapted, I have no doubt, to the gregarious taste of those seekers \nafter health or pleasure who repair here, but inexpressibly \ncomfortless to me.  We were shown into an immense apartment, \nlighted by two dim candles, called the drawing-room:  from which \nthere was a descent by a flight of steps, to another vast desert, \ncalled the dining-room:  our bed-chambers were among certain long \nrows of little white-washed cells, which opened from either side of \na dreary passage; and were so like rooms in a prison that I half \nexpected to be locked up when I went to bed, and listened \ninvoluntarily for the turning of the key on the outside.  There \nneed be baths somewhere in the neighbourhood, for the other washing \narrangements were on as limited a scale as I ever saw, even in \nAmerica:  indeed, these bedrooms were so very bare of even such \ncommon luxuries as chairs, that I should say they were not provided \nwith enough of anything, but that I bethink myself of our having \nbeen most bountifully bitten all night.\n\nThe house is very pleasantly situated, however, and we had a good \nbreakfast.  That done, we went to visit our place of destination, \nwhich was some two miles off, and the way to which was soon \nindicated by a finger-post, whereon was painted, \'To the Shaker \nVillage.\'\n\nAs we rode along, we passed a party of Shakers, who were at work \nupon the road; who wore the broadest of all broad-brimmed hats; and \nwere in all visible respects such very wooden men, that I felt \nabout as much sympathy for them, and as much interest in them, as \nif they had been so many figure-heads of ships.  Presently we came \nto the beginning of the village, and alighting at the door of a \nhouse where the Shaker manufactures are sold, and which is the \nheadquarters of the elders, requested permission to see the Shaker \nworship.\n\nPending the conveyance of this request to some person in authority, \nwe walked into a grim room, where several grim hats were hanging on \ngrim pegs, and the time was grimly told by a grim clock which \nuttered every tick with a kind of struggle, as if it broke the grim \nsilence reluctantly, and under protest.  Ranged against the wall \nwere six or eight stiff, high-backed chairs, and they partook so \nstrongly of the general grimness that one would much rather have \nsat on the floor than incurred the smallest obligation to any of \nthem.\n\nPresently, there stalked into this apartment, a grim old Shaker, \nwith eyes as hard, and dull, and cold, as the great round metal \nbuttons on his coat and waistcoat; a sort of calm goblin.  Being \ninformed of our desire, he produced a newspaper wherein the body of \nelders, whereof he was a member, had advertised but a few days \nbefore, that in consequence of certain unseemly interruptions which \ntheir worship had received from strangers, their chapel was closed \nto the public for the space of one year.\n\nAs nothing was to be urged in opposition to this reasonable \narrangement, we requested leave to make some trifling purchases of \nShaker goods; which was grimly conceded.  We accordingly repaired \nto a store in the same house and on the opposite side of the \npassage, where the stock was presided over by something alive in a \nrusset case, which the elder said was a woman; and which I suppose \nWAS a woman, though I should not have suspected it.\n\nOn the opposite side of the road was their place of worship:  a \ncool, clean edifice of wood, with large windows and green blinds:  \nlike a spacious summer-house.  As there was no getting into this \nplace, and nothing was to be done but walk up and down, and look at \nit and the other buildings in the village (which were chiefly of \nwood, painted a dark red like English barns, and composed of many \nstories like English factories), I have nothing to communicate to \nthe reader, beyond the scanty results I gleaned the while our \npurchases were making,\n\nThese people are called Shakers from their peculiar form of \nadoration, which consists of a dance, performed by the men and \nwomen of all ages, who arrange themselves for that purpose in \nopposite parties:  the men first divesting themselves of their hats \nand coats, which they gravely hang against the wall before they \nbegin; and tying a ribbon round their shirt-sleeves, as though they \nwere going to be bled.  They accompany themselves with a droning, \nhumming noise, and dance until they are quite exhausted, \nalternately advancing and retiring in a preposterous sort of trot.  \nThe effect is said to be unspeakably absurd:  and if I may judge \nfrom a print of this ceremony which I have in my possession; and \nwhich I am informed by those who have visited the chapel, is \nperfectly accurate; it must be infinitely grotesque.\n\nThey are governed by a woman, and her rule is understood to be \nabsolute, though she has the assistance of a council of elders.  \nShe lives, it is said, in strict seclusion, in certain rooms above \nthe chapel, and is never shown to profane eyes.  If she at all \nresemble the lady who presided over the store, it is a great \ncharity to keep her as close as possible, and I cannot too strongly \nexpress my perfect concurrence in this benevolent proceeding.\n\nAll the possessions and revenues of the settlement are thrown into \na common stock, which is managed by the elders.  As they have made \nconverts among people who were well to do in the world, and are \nfrugal and thrifty, it is understood that this fund prospers:  the \nmore especially as they have made large purchases of land.  Nor is \nthis at Lebanon the only Shaker settlement:  there are, I think, at \nleast, three others.\n\nThey are good farmers, and all their produce is eagerly purchased \nand highly esteemed.  \'Shaker seeds,\' \'Shaker herbs,\' and \'Shaker \ndistilled waters,\' are commonly announced for sale in the shops of \ntowns and cities.  They are good breeders of cattle, and are kind \nand merciful to the brute creation.  Consequently, Shaker beasts \nseldom fail to find a ready market.\n\nThey eat and drink together, after the Spartan model, at a great \npublic table.  There is no union of the sexes, and every Shaker, \nmale and female, is devoted to a life of celibacy.  Rumour has been \nbusy upon this theme, but here again I must refer to the lady of \nthe store, and say, that if many of the sister Shakers resemble \nher, I treat all such slander as bearing on its face the strongest \nmarks of wild improbability.  But that they take as proselytes, \npersons so young that they cannot know their own minds, and cannot \npossess much strength of resolution in this or any other respect, I \ncan assert from my own observation of the extreme juvenility of \ncertain youthful Shakers whom I saw at work among the party on the \nroad.\n\nThey are said to be good drivers of bargains, but to be honest and \njust in their transactions, and even in horse-dealing to resist \nthose thievish tendencies which would seem, for some undiscovered \nreason, to be almost inseparable from that branch of traffic.  In \nall matters they hold their own course quietly, live in their \ngloomy, silent commonwealth, and show little desire to interfere \nwith other people.\n\nThis is well enough, but nevertheless I cannot, I confess, incline \ntowards the Shakers; view them with much favour, or extend towards \nthem any very lenient construction.  I so abhor, and from my soul \ndetest that bad spirit, no matter by what class or sect it may be \nentertained, which would strip life of its healthful graces, rob \nyouth of its innocent pleasures, pluck from maturity and age their \npleasant ornaments, and make existence but a narrow path towards \nthe grave:  that odious spirit which, if it could have had full \nscope and sway upon the earth, must have blasted and made barren \nthe imaginations of the greatest men, and left them, in their power \nof raising up enduring images before their fellow-creatures yet \nunborn, no better than the beasts:  that, in these very broad-\nbrimmed hats and very sombre coats - in stiff-necked, solemn-\nvisaged piety, in short, no matter what its garb, whether it have \ncropped hair as in a Shaker village, or long nails as in a Hindoo \ntemple - I recognise the worst among the enemies of Heaven and \nEarth, who turn the water at the marriage feasts of this poor \nworld, not into wine, but gall.  And if there must be people vowed \nto crush the harmless fancies and the love of innocent delights and \ngaieties, which are a part of human nature:  as much a part of it \nas any other love or hope that is our common portion:  let them, \nfor me, stand openly revealed among the ribald and licentious; the \nvery idiots know that THEY are not on the Immortal road, and will \ndespise them, and avoid them readily.\n\nLeaving the Shaker village with a hearty dislike of the old \nShakers, and a hearty pity for the young ones:  tempered by the \nstrong probability of their running away as they grow older and \nwiser, which they not uncommonly do:  we returned to Lebanon, and \nso to Hudson, by the way we had come upon the previous day.  There, \nwe took the steamboat down the North River towards New York, but \nstopped, some four hours\' journey short of it, at West Point, where \nwe remained that night, and all next day, and next night too.\n\nIn this beautiful place:  the fairest among the fair and lovely \nHighlands of the North River:  shut in by deep green heights and \nruined forts, and looking down upon the distant town of Newburgh, \nalong a glittering path of sunlit water, with here and there a \nskiff, whose white sail often bends on some new tack as sudden \nflaws of wind come down upon her from the gullies in the hills:  \nhemmed in, besides, all round with memories of Washington, and \nevents of the revolutionary war:  is the Military School of \nAmerica.\n\nIt could not stand on more appropriate ground, and any ground more \nbeautiful can hardly be.  The course of education is severe, but \nwell devised, and manly.  Through June, July, and August, the young \nmen encamp upon the spacious plain whereon the college stands; and \nall the year their military exercises are performed there, daily.  \nThe term of study at this institution, which the State requires \nfrom all cadets, is four years; but, whether it be from the rigid \nnature of the discipline, or the national impatience of restraint, \nor both causes combined, not more than half the number who begin \ntheir studies here, ever remain to finish them.\n\nThe number of cadets being about equal to that of the members of \nCongress, one is sent here from every Congressional district:  its \nmember influencing the selection.  Commissions in the service are \ndistributed on the same principle.  The dwellings of the various \nProfessors are beautifully situated; and there is a most excellent \nhotel for strangers, though it has the two drawbacks of being a \ntotal abstinence house (wines and spirits being forbidden to the \nstudents), and of serving the public meals at rather uncomfortable \nhours:  to wit, breakfast at seven, dinner at one, and supper at \nsunset.\n\nThe beauty and freshness of this calm retreat, in the very dawn and \ngreenness of summer - it was then the beginning of June - were \nexquisite indeed.  Leaving it upon the sixth, and returning to New \nYork, to embark for England on the succeeding day, I was glad to \nthink that among the last memorable beauties which had glided past \nus, and softened in the bright perspective, were those whose \npictures, traced by no common hand, are fresh in most men\'s minds; \nnot easily to grow old, or fade beneath the dust of Time:  the \nKaatskill Mountains, Sleepy Hollow, and the Tappaan Zee.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI - THE PASSAGE HOME\n\n\n\nI NEVER had so much interest before, and very likely I shall never \nhave so much interest again, in the state of the wind, as on the \nlong-looked-for morning of Tuesday the Seventh of June.  Some \nnautical authority had told me a day or two previous, \'anything \nwith west in it, will do;\' so when I darted out of bed at daylight, \nand throwing up the window, was saluted by a lively breeze from the \nnorth-west which had sprung up in the night, it came upon me so \nfreshly, rustling with so many happy associations, that I conceived \nupon the spot a special regard for all airs blowing from that \nquarter of the compass, which I shall cherish, I dare say, until my \nown wind has breathed its last frail puff, and withdrawn itself for \never from the mortal calendar.\n\nThe pilot had not been slow to take advantage of this favourable \nweather, and the ship which yesterday had been in such a crowded \ndock that she might have retired from trade for good and all, for \nany chance she seemed to have of going to sea, was now full sixteen \nmiles away.  A gallant sight she was, when we, fast gaining on her \nin a steamboat, saw her in the distance riding at anchor:  her tall \nmasts pointing up in graceful lines against the sky, and every rope \nand spar expressed in delicate and thread-like outline:  gallant, \ntoo, when, we being all aboard, the anchor came up to the sturdy \nchorus \'Cheerily men, oh cheerily!\' and she followed proudly in the \ntowing steamboat\'s wake:  but bravest and most gallant of all, when \nthe tow-rope being cast adrift, the canvas fluttered from her \nmasts, and spreading her white wings she soared away upon her free \nand solitary course.\n\nIn the after cabin we were only fifteen passengers in all, and the \ngreater part were from Canada, where some of us had known each \nother.  The night was rough and squally, so were the next two days, \nbut they flew by quickly, and we were soon as cheerful and snug a \nparty, with an honest, manly-hearted captain at our head, as ever \ncame to the resolution of being mutually agreeable, on land or \nwater.\n\nWe breakfasted at eight, lunched at twelve, dined at three, and \ntook our tea at half-past seven.  We had abundance of amusements, \nand dinner was not the least among them:  firstly, for its own \nsake; secondly, because of its extraordinary length:  its duration, \ninclusive of all the long pauses between the courses, being seldom \nless than two hours and a half; which was a subject of never-\nfailing entertainment.  By way of beguiling the tediousness of \nthese banquets, a select association was formed at the lower end of \nthe table, below the mast, to whose distinguished president modesty \nforbids me to make any further allusion, which, being a very \nhilarious and jovial institution, was (prejudice apart) in high \nfavour with the rest of the community, and particularly with a \nblack steward, who lived for three weeks in a broad grin at the \nmarvellous humour of these incorporated worthies.\n\nThen, we had chess for those who played it, whist, cribbage, books, \nbackgammon, and shovelboard.  In all weathers, fair or foul, calm \nor windy, we were every one on deck, walking up and down in pairs, \nlying in the boats, leaning over the side, or chatting in a lazy \ngroup together.  We had no lack of music, for one played the \naccordion, another the violin, and another (who usually began at \nsix o\'clock A.M.) the key-bugle:  the combined effect of which \ninstruments, when they all played different tunes in differents \nparts of the ship, at the same time, and within hearing of each \nother, as they sometimes did (everybody being intensely satisfied \nwith his own performance), was sublimely hideous.\n\nWhen all these means of entertainment failed, a sail would heave in \nsight:  looming, perhaps, the very spirit of a ship, in the misty \ndistance, or passing us so close that through our glasses we could \nsee the people on her decks, and easily make out her name, and \nwhither she was bound.  For hours together we could watch the \ndolphins and porpoises as they rolled and leaped and dived around \nthe vessel; or those small creatures ever on the wing, the Mother \nCarey\'s chickens, which had borne us company from New York bay, and \nfor a whole fortnight fluttered about the vessel\'s stern.  For some \ndays we had a dead calm, or very light winds, during which the crew \namused themselves with fishing, and hooked an unlucky dolphin, who \nexpired, in all his rainbow colours, on the deck:  an event of such \nimportance in our barren calendar, that afterwards we dated from \nthe dolphin, and made the day on which he died, an era.\n\nBesides all this, when we were five or six days out, there began to \nbe much talk of icebergs, of which wandering islands an unusual \nnumber had been seen by the vessels that had come into New York a \nday or two before we left that port, and of whose dangerous \nneighbourhood we were warned by the sudden coldness of the weather, \nand the sinking of the mercury in the barometer.  While these \ntokens lasted, a double look-out was kept, and many dismal tales \nwere whispered after dark, of ships that had struck upon the ice \nand gone down in the night; but the wind obliging us to hold a \nsouthward course, we saw none of them, and the weather soon grew \nbright and warm again.\n\nThe observation every day at noon, and the subsequent working of \nthe vessel\'s course, was, as may be supposed, a feature in our \nlives of paramount importance; nor were there wanting (as there \nnever are) sagacious doubters of the captain\'s calculations, who, \nso soon as his back was turned, would, in the absence of compasses, \nmeasure the chart with bits of string, and ends of pocket-\nhandkerchiefs, and points of snuffers, and clearly prove him to be \nwrong by an odd thousand miles or so.  It was very edifying to see \nthese unbelievers shake their heads and frown, and hear them hold \nforth strongly upon navigation:  not that they knew anything about \nit, but that they always mistrusted the captain in calm weather, or \nwhen the wind was adverse.  Indeed, the mercury itself is not so \nvariable as this class of passengers, whom you will see, when the \nship is going nobly through the water, quite pale with admiration, \nswearing that the captain beats all captains ever known, and even \nhinting at subscriptions for a piece of plate; and who, next \nmorning, when the breeze has lulled, and all the sails hang useless \nin the idle air, shake their despondent heads again, and say, with \nscrewed-up lips, they hope that captain is a sailor - but they \nshrewdly doubt him.\n\nIt even became an occupation in the calm, to wonder when the wind \nWOULD spring up in the favourable quarter, where, it was clearly \nshown by all the rules and precedents, it ought to have sprung up \nlong ago.  The first mate, who whistled for it zealously, was much \nrespected for his perseverance, and was regarded even by the \nunbelievers as a first-rate sailor.  Many gloomy looks would be \ncast upward through the cabin skylights at the flapping sails while \ndinner was in progress; and some, growing bold in ruefulness, \npredicted that we should land about the middle of July.  There are \nalways on board ship, a Sanguine One, and a Despondent One.  The \nlatter character carried it hollow at this period of the voyage, \nand triumphed over the Sanguine One at every meal, by inquiring \nwhere he supposed the Great Western (which left New York a week \nafter us) was NOW:  and where he supposed the \'Cunard\' steam-packet \nwas NOW:  and what he thought of sailing vessels, as compared with \nsteamships NOW:  and so beset his life with pestilent attacks of \nthat kind, that he too was obliged to affect despondency, for very \npeace and quietude.\n\nThese were additions to the list of entertaining incidents, but \nthere was still another source of interest.  We carried in the \nsteerage nearly a hundred passengers:  a little world of poverty:  \nand as we came to know individuals among them by sight, from \nlooking down upon the deck where they took the air in the daytime, \nand cooked their food, and very often ate it too, we became curious \nto know their histories, and with what expectations they had gone \nout to America, and on what errands they were going home, and what \ntheir circumstances were.  The information we got on these heads \nfrom the carpenter, who had charge of these people, was often of \nthe strangest kind.  Some of them had been in America but three \ndays, some but three months, and some had gone out in the last \nvoyage of that very ship in which they were now returning home.  \nOthers had sold their clothes to raise the passage-money, and had \nhardly rags to cover them; others had no food, and lived upon the \ncharity of the rest:  and one man, it was discovered nearly at the \nend of the voyage, not before - for he kept his secret close, and \ndid not court compassion - had had no sustenance whatever but the \nbones and scraps of fat he took from the plates used in the after-\ncabin dinner, when they were put out to be washed.\n\nThe whole system of shipping and conveying these unfortunate \npersons, is one that stands in need of thorough revision.  If any \nclass deserve to be protected and assisted by the Government, it is \nthat class who are banished from their native land in search of the \nbare means of subsistence.  All that could be done for these poor \npeople by the great compassion and humanity of the captain and \nofficers was done, but they require much more.  The law is bound, \nat least upon the English side, to see that too many of them are \nnot put on board one ship:  and that their accommodations are \ndecent:  not demoralising, and profligate.  It is bound, too, in \ncommon humanity, to declare that no man shall be taken on board \nwithout his stock of provisions being previously inspected by some \nproper officer, and pronounced moderately sufficient for his \nsupport upon the voyage.  It is bound to provide, or to require \nthat there be provided, a medical attendant; whereas in these ships \nthere are none, though sickness of adults, and deaths of children, \non the passage, are matters of the very commonest occurrence.  \nAbove all it is the duty of any Government, be it monarchy or \nrepublic, to interpose and put an end to that system by which a \nfirm of traders in emigrants purchase of the owners the whole \n\'tween-decks of a ship, and send on board as many wretched people \nas they can lay hold of, on any terms they can get, without the \nsmallest reference to the conveniences of the steerage, the number \nof berths, the slightest separation of the sexes, or anything but \ntheir own immediate profit.  Nor is even this the worst of the \nvicious system:  for, certain crimping agents of these houses, who \nhave a percentage on all the passengers they inveigle, are \nconstantly travelling about those districts where poverty and \ndiscontent are rife, and tempting the credulous into more misery, \nby holding out monstrous inducements to emigration which can never \nbe realised.\n\nThe history of every family we had on board was pretty much the \nsame.  After hoarding up, and borrowing, and begging, and selling \neverything to pay the passage, they had gone out to New York, \nexpecting to find its streets paved with gold; and had found them \npaved with very hard and very real stones.  Enterprise was dull; \nlabourers were not wanted; jobs of work were to be got, but the \npayment was not.  They were coming back, even poorer than they \nwent.  One of them was carrying an open letter from a young English \nartisan, who had been in New York a fortnight, to a friend near \nManchester, whom he strongly urged to follow him.  One of the \nofficers brought it to me as a curiosity.  \'This is the country, \nJem,\' said the writer.  \'I like America.  There is no despotism \nhere; that\'s the great thing.  Employment of all sorts is going a-\nbegging, and wages are capital.  You have only to choose a trade, \nJem, and be it.  I haven\'t made choice of one yet, but I shall \nsoon.  AT PRESENT I HAVEN\'T QUITE MADE UP MY MIND WHETHER TO BE A \nCARPENTER - OR A TAILOR.\'\n\nThere was yet another kind of passenger, and but one more, who, in \nthe calm and the light winds, was a constant theme of conversation \nand observation among us.  This was an English sailor, a smart, \nthorough-built, English man-of-war\'s-man from his hat to his shoes, \nwho was serving in the American navy, and having got leave of \nabsence was on his way home to see his friends.  When he presented \nhimself to take and pay for his passage, it had been suggested to \nhim that being an able seaman he might as well work it and save the \nmoney, but this piece of advice he very indignantly rejected:  \nsaying, \'He\'d be damned but for once he\'d go aboard ship, as a \ngentleman.\'  Accordingly, they took his money, but he no sooner \ncame aboard, than he stowed his kit in the forecastle, arranged to \nmess with the crew, and the very first time the hands were turned \nup, went aloft like a cat, before anybody.  And all through the \npassage there he was, first at the braces, outermost on the yards, \nperpetually lending a hand everywhere, but always with a sober \ndignity in his manner, and a sober grin on his face, which plainly \nsaid, \'I do it as a gentleman.  For my own pleasure, mind you!\'\n\nAt length and at last, the promised wind came up in right good \nearnest, and away we went before it, with every stitch of canvas \nset, slashing through the water nobly.  There was a grandeur in the \nmotion of the splendid ship, as overshadowed by her mass of sails, \nshe rode at a furious pace upon the waves, which filled one with an \nindescribable sense of pride and exultation.  As she plunged into a \nfoaming valley, how I loved to see the green waves, bordered deep \nwith white, come rushing on astern, to buoy her upward at their \npleasure, and curl about her as she stooped again, but always own \nher for their haughty mistress still!  On, on we flew, with \nchanging lights upon the water, being now in the blessed region of \nfleecy skies; a bright sun lighting us by day, and a bright moon by \nnight; the vane pointing directly homeward, alike the truthful \nindex to the favouring wind and to our cheerful hearts; until at \nsunrise, one fair Monday morning - the twenty-seventh of June, I \nshall not easily forget the day - there lay before us, old Cape \nClear, God bless it, showing, in the mist of early morning, like a \ncloud:  the brightest and most welcome cloud, to us, that ever hid \nthe face of Heaven\'s fallen sister - Home.\n\nDim speck as it was in the wide prospect, it made the sunrise a \nmore cheerful sight, and gave to it that sort of human interest \nwhich it seems to want at sea.  There, as elsewhere, the return of \nday is inseparable from some sense of renewed hope and gladness; \nbut the light shining on the dreary waste of water, and showing it \nin all its vast extent of loneliness, presents a solemn spectacle, \nwhich even night, veiling it in darkness and uncertainty, does not \nsurpass.  The rising of the moon is more in keeping with the \nsolitary ocean; and has an air of melancholy grandeur, which in its \nsoft and gentle influence, seems to comfort while it saddens.  I \nrecollect when I was a very young child having a fancy that the \nreflection of the moon in water was a path to Heaven, trodden by \nthe spirits of good people on their way to God; and this old \nfeeling often came over me again, when I watched it on a tranquil \nnight at sea.\n\nThe wind was very light on this same Monday morning, but it was \nstill in the right quarter, and so, by slow degrees, we left Cape \nClear behind, and sailed along within sight of the coast of \nIreland.  And how merry we all were, and how loyal to the George \nWashington, and how full of mutual congratulations, and how \nventuresome in predicting the exact hour at which we should arrive \nat Liverpool, may be easily imagined and readily understood.  Also, \nhow heartily we drank the captain\'s health that day at dinner; and \nhow restless we became about packing up:  and how two or three of \nthe most sanguine spirits rejected the idea of going to bed at all \nthat night as something it was not worth while to do, so near the \nshore, but went nevertheless, and slept soundly; and how to be so \nnear our journey\'s end, was like a pleasant dream, from which one \nfeared to wake.\n\nThe friendly breeze freshened again next day, and on we went once \nmore before it gallantly:  descrying now and then an English ship \ngoing homeward under shortened sail, while we, with every inch of \ncanvas crowded on, dashed gaily past, and left her far behind.  \nTowards evening, the weather turned hazy, with a drizzling rain; \nand soon became so thick, that we sailed, as it were, in a cloud.  \nStill we swept onward like a phantom ship, and many an eager eye \nglanced up to where the Look-out on the mast kept watch for \nHolyhead.\n\nAt length his long-expected cry was heard, and at the same moment \nthere shone out from the haze and mist ahead, a gleaming light, \nwhich presently was gone, and soon returned, and soon was gone \nagain.  Whenever it came back, the eyes of all on board, brightened \nand sparkled like itself:  and there we all stood, watching this \nrevolving light upon the rock at Holyhead, and praising it for its \nbrightness and its friendly warning, and lauding it, in short, \nabove all other signal lights that ever were displayed, until it \nonce more glimmered faintly in the distance, far behind us.\n\nThen, it was time to fire a gun, for a pilot; and almost before its \nsmoke had cleared away, a little boat with a light at her masthead \ncame bearing down upon us, through the darkness, swiftly.  And \npresently, our sails being backed, she ran alongside; and the \nhoarse pilot, wrapped and muffled in pea-coats and shawls to the \nvery bridge of his weather-ploughed-up nose, stood bodily among us \non the deck.  And I think if that pilot had wanted to borrow fifty \npounds for an indefinite period on no security, we should have \nengaged to lend it to him, among us, before his boat had dropped \nastern, or (which is the same thing) before every scrap of news in \nthe paper he brought with him had become the common property of all \non board.\n\nWe turned in pretty late that night, and turned out pretty early \nnext morning.  By six o\'clock we clustered on the deck, prepared to \ngo ashore; and looked upon the spires, and roofs, and smoke, of \nLiverpool.  By eight we all sat down in one of its Hotels, to eat \nand drink together for the last time.  And by nine we had shaken \nhands all round, and broken up our social company for ever.\n\nThe country, by the railroad, seemed, as we rattled through it, \nlike a luxuriant garden.  The beauty of the fields (so small they \nlooked!), the hedge-rows, and the trees; the pretty cottages, the \nbeds of flowers, the old churchyards, the antique houses, and every \nwell-known object; the exquisite delights of that one journey, \ncrowding in the short compass of a summer\'s day, the joy of many \nyears, with the winding up with Home and all that makes it dear; no \ntongue can tell, or pen of mine describe.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI - SLAVERY\n\n\n\nTHE upholders of slavery in America - of the atrocities of which \nsystem, I shall not write one word for which I have not had ample \nproof and warrant - may be divided into three great classes.\n\nThe first, are those more moderate and rational owners of human \ncattle, who have come into the possession of them as so many coins \nin their trading capital, but who admit the frightful nature of the \nInstitution in the abstract, and perceive the dangers to society \nwith which it is fraught:  dangers which however distant they may \nbe, or howsoever tardy in their coming on, are as certain to fall \nupon its guilty head, as is the Day of Judgment.\n\nThe second, consists of all those owners, breeders, users, buyers \nand sellers of slaves, who will, until the bloody chapter has a \nbloody end, own, breed, use, buy, and sell them at all hazards:  \nwho doggedly deny the horrors of the system in the teeth of such a \nmass of evidence as never was brought to bear on any other subject, \nand to which the experience of every day contributes its immense \namount; who would at this or any other moment, gladly involve \nAmerica in a war, civil or foreign, provided that it had for its \nsole end and object the assertion of their right to perpetuate \nslavery, and to whip and work and torture slaves, unquestioned by \nany human authority, and unassailed by any human power; who, when \nthey speak of Freedom, mean the Freedom to oppress their kind, and \nto be savage, merciless, and cruel; and of whom every man on his \nown ground, in republican America, is a more exacting, and a \nsterner, and a less responsible despot than the Caliph Haroun \nAlraschid in his angry robe of scarlet.\n\nThe third, and not the least numerous or influential, is composed \nof all that delicate gentility which cannot bear a superior, and \ncannot brook an equal; of that class whose Republicanism means, \'I \nwill not tolerate a man above me:  and of those below, none must \napproach too near;\' whose pride, in a land where voluntary \nservitude is shunned as a disgrace, must be ministered to by \nslaves; and whose inalienable rights can only have their growth in \nnegro wrongs.\n\nIt has been sometimes urged that, in the unavailing efforts which \nhave been made to advance the cause of Human Freedom in the \nrepublic of America (strange cause for history to treat of!), \nsufficient regard has not been had to the existence of the first \nclass of persons; and it has been contended that they are hardly \nused, in being confounded with the second.  This is, no doubt, the \ncase; noble instances of pecuniary and personal sacrifice have \nalready had their growth among them; and it is much to be regretted \nthat the gulf between them and the advocates of emancipation should \nhave been widened and deepened by any means:  the rather, as there \nare, beyond dispute, among these slave-owners, many kind masters \nwho are tender in the exercise of their unnatural power.  Still, it \nis to be feared that this injustice is inseparable from the state \nof things with which humanity and truth are called upon to deal.  \nSlavery is not a whit the more endurable because some hearts are to \nbe found which can partially resist its hardening influences; nor \ncan the indignant tide of honest wrath stand still, because in its \nonward course it overwhelms a few who are comparatively innocent, \namong a host of guilty.\n\nThe ground most commonly taken by these better men among the \nadvocates of slavery, is this:  \'It is a bad system; and for myself \nI would willingly get rid of it, if I could; most willingly.  But \nit is not so bad, as you in England take it to be.  You are \ndeceived by the representations of the emancipationists.  The \ngreater part of my slaves are much attached to me.  You will say \nthat I do not allow them to be severely treated; but I will put it \nto you whether you believe that it can be a general practice to \ntreat them inhumanly, when it would impair their value, and would \nbe obviously against the interests of their masters.\'\n\nIs it the interest of any man to steal, to game, to waste his \nhealth and mental faculties by drunkenness, to lie, forswear \nhimself, indulge hatred, seek desperate revenge, or do murder?  No.  \nAll these are roads to ruin.  And why, then, do men tread them?  \nBecause such inclinations are among the vicious qualities of \nmankind.  Blot out, ye friends of slavery, from the catalogue of \nhuman passions, brutal lust, cruelty, and the abuse of \nirresponsible power (of all earthly temptations the most difficult \nto be resisted), and when ye have done so, and not before, we will \ninquire whether it be the interest of a master to lash and maim the \nslaves, over whose lives and limbs he has an absolute control!\n\nBut again:  this class, together with that last one I have named, \nthe miserable aristocracy spawned of a false republic, lift up \ntheir voices and exclaim \'Public opinion is all-sufficient to \nprevent such cruelty as you denounce.\'  Public opinion!  Why, \npublic opinion in the slave States IS slavery, is it not?  Public \nopinion, in the slave States, has delivered the slaves over, to the \ngentle mercies of their masters.  Public opinion has made the laws, \nand denied the slaves legislative protection.  Public opinion has \nknotted the lash, heated the branding-iron, loaded the rifle, and \nshielded the murderer.  Public opinion threatens the abolitionist \nwith death, if he venture to the South; and drags him with a rope \nabout his middle, in broad unblushing noon, through the first city \nin the East.  Public opinion has, within a few years, burned a \nslave alive at a slow fire in the city of St. Louis; and public \nopinion has to this day maintained upon the bench that estimable \njudge who charged the jury, impanelled there to try his murderers, \nthat their most horrid deed was an act of public opinion, and being \nso, must not be punished by the laws the public sentiment had made.  \nPublic opinion hailed this doctrine with a howl of wild applause, \nand set the prisoners free, to walk the city, men of mark, and \ninfluence, and station, as they had been before.\n\nPublic opinion! what class of men have an immense preponderance \nover the rest of the community, in their power of representing \npublic opinion in the legislature? the slave-owners.  They send \nfrom their twelve States one hundred members, while the fourteen \nfree States, with a free population nearly double, return but a \nhundred and forty-two.  Before whom do the presidential candidates \nbow down the most humbly, on whom do they fawn the most fondly, and \nfor whose tastes do they cater the most assiduously in their \nservile protestations?  The slave-owners always.\n\nPublic opinion! hear the public opinion of the free South, as \nexpressed by its own members in the House of Representatives at \nWashington.  \'I have a great respect for the chair,\' quoth North \nCarolina, \'I have a great respect for the chair as an officer of \nthe house, and a great respect for him personally; nothing but that \nrespect prevents me from rushing to the table and tearing that \npetition which has just been presented for the abolition of slavery \nin the district of Columbia, to pieces.\' - \'I warn the \nabolitionists,\' says South Carolina, \'ignorant, infuriated \nbarbarians as they are, that if chance shall throw any of them into \nour hands, he may expect a felon\'s death.\' - \'Let an abolitionist \ncome within the borders of South Carolina,\' cries a third; mild \nCarolina\'s colleague; \'and if we can catch him, we will try him, \nand notwithstanding the interference of all the governments on \nearth, including the Federal government, we will HANG him.\'\n\nPublic opinion has made this law. - It has declared that in \nWashington, in that city which takes its name from the father of \nAmerican liberty, any justice of the peace may bind with fetters \nany negro passing down the street and thrust him into jail:  no \noffence on the black man\'s part is necessary.  The justice says, \'I \nchoose to think this man a runaway:\' and locks him up.  Public \nopinion impowers the man of law when this is done, to advertise the \nnegro in the newspapers, warning his owner to come and claim him, \nor he will be sold to pay the jail fees.  But supposing he is a \nfree black, and has no owner, it may naturally be presumed that he \nis set at liberty.  No:  HE IS SOLD TO RECOMPENSE HIS JAILER.  This \nhas been done again, and again, and again.  He has no means of \nproving his freedom; has no adviser, messenger, or assistance of \nany sort or kind; no investigation into his case is made, or \ninquiry instituted.  He, a free man, who may have served for years, \nand bought his liberty, is thrown into jail on no process, for no \ncrime, and on no pretence of crime:  and is sold to pay the jail \nfees.  This seems incredible, even of America, but it is the law.\n\nPublic opinion is deferred to, in such cases as the following:  \nwhich is headed in the newspapers:-\n\n\n\'INTERESTING LAW-CASE.\n\n\'An interesting case is now on trial in the Supreme Court, arising \nout of the following facts.  A gentleman residing in Maryland had \nallowed an aged pair of his slaves, substantial though not legal \nfreedom for several years.  While thus living, a daughter was born \nto them, who grew up in the same liberty, until she married a free \nnegro, and went with him to reside in Pennsylvania.  They had \nseveral children, and lived unmolested until the original owner \ndied, when his heir attempted to regain them; but the magistrate \nbefore whom they were brought, decided that he had no jurisdiction \nin the case.  THE OWNER SEIZED THE WOMAN AND HER CHILDREN ITS THE \nNIGHT, AND CARRIED THEM TO MARYLAND.\'\n\n\n\'Cash for negroes,\' \'cash for negroes,\' \'cash for negroes,\' is the \nheading of advertisements in great capitals down the long columns \nof the crowded journals.  Woodcuts of a runaway negro with manacled \nhands, crouching beneath a bluff pursuer in top boots, who, having \ncaught him, grasps him by the throat, agreeably diversify the \npleasant text.  The leading article protests against \'that \nabominable and hellish doctrine of abolition, which is repugnant \nalike to every law of God and nature.\'  The delicate mamma, who \nsmiles her acquiescence in this sprightly writing as she reads the \npaper in her cool piazza, quiets her youngest child who clings \nabout her skirts, by promising the boy \'a whip to beat the little \nniggers with.\' - But the negroes, little and big, are protected by \npublic opinion.\n\nLet us try this public opinion by another test, which is important \nin three points of view:  first, as showing how desperately timid \nof the public opinion slave-owners are, in their delicate \ndescriptions of fugitive slaves in widely circulated newspapers; \nsecondly, as showing how perfectly contented the slaves are, and \nhow very seldom they run away; thirdly, as exhibiting their entire \nfreedom from scar, or blemish, or any mark of cruel infliction, as \ntheir pictures are drawn, not by lying abolitionists, but by their \nown truthful masters.\n\nThe following are a few specimens of the advertisements in the \npublic papers.  It is only four years since the oldest among them \nappeared; and others of the same nature continue to be published \nevery day, in shoals.\n\n\'Ran away, Negress Caroline.  Had on a collar with one prong turned \ndown.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a black woman, Betsy.  Had an iron bar on her right \nleg.\'\n\n\'Ran away, the negro Manuel.  Much marked with irons.\'\n\n\'Ran away, the negress Fanny.  Had on an iron band about her neck.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a negro boy about twelve years old.  Had round his neck \na chain dog-collar with \"De Lampert\" engraved on it.\'\n\n\'Ran away, the negro Hown.  Has a ring of iron on his left foot.  \nAlso, Grise, HIS WIFE, having a ring and chain on the left leg.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a negro boy named James.  Said boy was ironed when he \nleft me.\'\n\n\'Committed to jail, a man who calls his name John.  He has a clog \nof iron on his right foot which will weigh four or five pounds.\'\n\n\'Detained at the police jail, the negro wench, Myra.  Has several \nmarks of LASHING, and has irons on her feet.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a negro woman and two children.  A few days before she \nwent off, I burnt her with a hot iron, on the left side of her \nface.  I tried to make the letter M.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a negro man named Henry; his left eye out, some scars \nfrom a dirk on and under his left arm, and much scarred with the \nwhip.\'\n\n\'One hundred dollars reward, for a negro fellow, Pompey, 40 years \nold.  He is branded on the left jaw.\'\n\n\'Committed to jail, a negro man.  Has no toes on the left foot.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a negro woman named Rachel.  Has lost all her toes \nexcept the large one.\'\n\n\'Ran away, Sam.  He was shot a short time since through the hand, \nand has several shots in his left arm and side.\'\n\n\'Ran away, my negro man Dennis.  Said negro has been shot in the \nleft arm between the shoulder and elbow, which has paralysed the \nleft hand.\'\n\n\'Ran away, my negro man named Simon.  He has been shot badly, in \nhis back and right arm.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a negro named Arthur.  Has a considerable scar across \nhis breast and each arm, made by a knife; loves to talk much of the \ngoodness of God.\'\n\n\'Twenty-five dollars reward for my man Isaac.  He has a scar on his \nforehead, caused by a blow; and one on his back, made by a shot \nfrom a pistol.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a negro girl called Mary.  Has a small scar over her \neye, a good many teeth missing, the letter A is branded on her \ncheek and forehead.\'\n\n\'Ran away, negro Ben.  Has a scar on his right hand; his thumb and \nforefinger being injured by being shot last fall.  A part of the \nbone came out.  He has also one or two large scars on his back and \nhips.\'\n\n\'Detained at the jail, a mulatto, named Tom.  Has a scar on the \nright cheek, and appears to have been burned with powder on the \nface.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a negro man named Ned.  Three of his fingers are drawn \ninto the palm of his hand by a cut.  Has a scar on the back of his \nneck, nearly half round, done by a knife.\'\n\n\'Was committed to jail, a negro man.  Says his name is Josiah.  His \nback very much scarred by the whip; and branded on the thigh and \nhips in three or four places, thus (J M).  The rim of his right ear \nhas been bit or cut off.\'\n\n\'Fifty dollars reward, for my fellow Edward.  He has a scar on the \ncorner of his mouth, two cuts on and under his arm, and the letter \nE on his arm.\'\n\n\'Ran away, negro boy Ellie.  Has a scar on one of his arms from the \nbite of a dog.\'\n\n\'Ran away, from the plantation of James Surgette, the following \nnegroes:  Randal, has one ear cropped; Bob, has lost one eye; \nKentucky Tom, has one jaw broken.\'\n\n\'Ran away, Anthony.  One of his ears cut off, and his left hand cut \nwith an axe.\'\n\n\'Fifty dollars reward for the negro Jim Blake.  Has a piece cut out \nof each ear, and the middle finger of the left hand cut off to the \nsecond joint.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a negro woman named Maria.  Has a scar on one side of \nher cheek, by a cut.  Some scars on her back.\'\n\n\'Ran away, the Mulatto wench Mary.  Has a cut on the left arm, a \nscar on the left shoulder, and two upper teeth missing.\'\n\nI should say, perhaps, in explanation of this latter piece of \ndescription, that among the other blessings which public opinion \nsecures to the negroes, is the common practice of violently \npunching out their teeth.  To make them wear iron collars by day \nand night, and to worry them with dogs, are practices almost too \nordinary to deserve mention.\n\n\'Ran away, my man Fountain.  Has holes in his ears, a scar on the \nright side of his forehead, has been shot in the hind part of his \nlegs, and is marked on the back with the whip.\'\n\n\'Two hundred and fifty dollars reward for my negro man Jim.  He is \nmuch marked with shot in his right thigh.  The shot entered on the \noutside, halfway between the hip and knee joints.\'\n\n\'Brought to jail, John.  Left ear cropt.\'\n\n\'Taken up, a negro man.  Is very much scarred about the face and \nbody, and has the left ear bit off.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a black girl, named Mary.  Has a scar on her cheek, and \nthe end of one of her toes cut off.\'\n\n\'Ran away, my Mulatto woman, Judy.  She has had her right arm \nbroke.\'\n\n\'Ran away, my negro man, Levi.  His left hand has been burnt, and I \nthink the end of his forefinger is off.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a negro man, NAMED WASHINGTON.  Has lost a part of his \nmiddle finger, and the end of his little finger.\'\n\n\'Twenty-five dollars reward for my man John.  The tip of his nose \nis bit off.\'\n\n\'Twenty-five dollars reward for the negro slave, Sally.  Walks AS \nTHOUGH crippled in the back.\'\n\n\'Ran away, Joe Dennis.  Has a small notch in one of his ears.\'\n\n\'Ran away, negro boy, Jack.  Has a small crop out of his left ear.\'\n\n\'Ran away, a negro man, named Ivory.  Has a small piece cut out of \nthe top of each ear.\'\n\nWhile upon the subject of ears, I may observe that a distinguished \nabolitionist in New York once received a negro\'s ear, which had \nbeen cut off close to the head, in a general post letter.  It was \nforwarded by the free and independent gentleman who had caused it \nto be amputated, with a polite request that he would place the \nspecimen in his \'collection.\'\n\nI could enlarge this catalogue with broken arms, and broken legs, \nand gashed flesh, and missing teeth, and lacerated backs, and bites \nof dogs, and brands of red-hot irons innumerable:  but as my \nreaders will be sufficiently sickened and repelled already, I will \nturn to another branch of the subject.\n\nThese advertisements, of which a similar collection might be made \nfor every year, and month, and week, and day; and which are coolly \nread in families as things of course, and as a part of the current \nnews and small-talk; will serve to show how very much the slaves \nprofit by public opinion, and how tender it is in their behalf.  \nBut it may be worth while to inquire how the slave-owners, and the \nclass of society to which great numbers of them belong, defer to \npublic opinion in their conduct, not to their slaves but to each \nother; how they are accustomed to restrain their passions; what \ntheir bearing is among themselves; whether they are fierce or \ngentle; whether their social customs be brutal, sanguinary, and \nviolent, or bear the impress of civilisation and refinement.\n\nThat we may have no partial evidence from abolitionists in this \ninquiry, either, I will once more turn to their own newspapers, and \nI will confine myself, this time, to a selection from paragraphs \nwhich appeared from day to day, during my visit to America, and \nwhich refer to occurrences happening while I was there.  The \nitalics in these extracts, as in the foregoing, are my own.\n\nThese cases did not ALL occur, it will be seen, in territory \nactually belonging to legalised Slave States, though most, and \nthose the very worst among them did, as their counterparts \nconstantly do; but the position of the scenes of action in \nreference to places immediately at hand, where slavery is the law; \nand the strong resemblance between that class of outrages and the \nrest; lead to the just presumption that the character of the \nparties concerned was formed in slave districts, and brutalised by \nslave customs.\n\n\n\'HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.\n\n\n\'By a slip from THE SOUTHPORT TELEGRAPH, Wisconsin, we learn that \nthe Hon. Charles C. P. Arndt, Member of the Council for Brown \ncounty, was shot dead ON THE FLOOR OF THE COUNCIL CHAMBER, by James \nR. Vinyard, Member from Grant county.  THE AFFAIR grew out of a \nnomination for Sheriff of Grant county.  Mr. E. S. Baker was \nnominated and supported by Mr. Arndt.  This nomination was opposed \nby Vinyard, who wanted the appointment to vest in his own brother.  \nIn the course of debate, the deceased made some statements which \nVinyard pronounced false, and made use of violent and insulting \nlanguage, dealing largely in personalities, to which Mr. A. made no \nreply.  After the adjournment, Mr. A. stepped up to Vinyard, and \nrequested him to retract, which he refused to do, repeating the \noffensive words.  Mr. Arndt then made a blow at Vinyard, who \nstepped back a pace, drew a pistol, and shot him dead.\n\n\'The issue appears to have been provoked on the part of Vinyard, \nwho was determined at all hazards to defeat the appointment of \nBaker, and who, himself defeated, turned his ire and revenge upon \nthe unfortunate Arndt.\'\n\n\n\'THE WISCONSIN TRAGEDY.\n\n\nPublic indignation runs high in the territory of Wisconsin, in \nrelation to the murder of C. C. P. Arndt, in the Legislative Hall \nof the Territory.  Meetings have been held in different counties of \nWisconsin, denouncing THE PRACTICE OF SECRETLY BEARING ARMS IN THE \nLEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS OF THE COUNTRY.  We have seen the account of \nthe expulsion of James R. Vinyard, the perpetrator of the bloody \ndeed, and are amazed to hear, that, after this expulsion by those \nwho saw Vinyard kill Mr. Arndt in the presence of his aged father, \nwho was on a visit to see his son, little dreaming that he was to \nwitness his murder, JUDGE DUNN HAS DISCHARGED VINYARD ON BAIL.  The \nMiners\' Free Press speaks IN TERMS OF MERITED REBUKE at the outrage \nupon the feelings of the people of Wisconsin.  Vinyard was within \narm\'s length of Mr. Arndt, when he took such deadly aim at him, \nthat he never spoke.  Vinyard might at pleasure, being so near, \nhave only wounded him, but he chose to kill him.\'\n\n\n\'MURDER.\n\n\nBy a letter in a St. Louis paper of the \'4th, we notice a terrible \noutrage at Burlington, Iowa.  A Mr. Bridgman having had a \ndifficulty with a citizen of the place, Mr. Ross; a brother-in-law \nof the latter provided himself with one of Colt\'s revolving \npistols, met Mr. B. in the street, AND DISCHARGED THE CONTENTS OF \nFIVE OF THE BARRELS AT HIM:  EACH SHOT TAKING EFFECT.  Mr. B., \nthough horribly wounded, and dying, returned the fire, and killed \nRoss on the spot.\'\n\n\n\'TERRIBLE DEATH OF ROBERT POTTER.\n\n\n\'From the \"Caddo Gazette,\" of the 12th inst., we learn the \nfrightful death of Colonel Robert Potter. . . . He was beset in his \nhouse by an enemy, named Rose.  He sprang from his couch, seized \nhis gun, and, in his night-clothes, rushed from the house.  For \nabout two hundred yards his speed seemed to defy his pursuers; but, \ngetting entangled in a thicket, he was captured.  Rose told him \nTHAT HE INTENDED TO ACT A GENEROUS PART, and give him a chance for \nhis life.  He then told Potter he might run, and he should not be \ninterrupted till he reached a certain distance.  Potter started at \nthe word of command, and before a gun was fired he had reached the \nlake.  His first impulse was to jump in the water and dive for it, \nwhich he did.  Rose was close behind him, and formed his men on the \nbank ready to shoot him as he rose.  In a few seconds he came up to \nbreathe; and scarce had his head reached the surface of the water \nwhen it was completely riddled with the shot of their guns, and he \nsunk, to rise no more!\'\n\n\n\'MURDER IN ARKANSAS.\n\n\n\'We understand THAT A SEVERE RENCONTRE CAME OFF a few days since in \nthe Seneca Nation, between Mr. Loose, the sub-agent of the mixed \nband of the Senecas, Quapaw, and Shawnees, and Mr. James Gillespie, \nof the mercantile firm of Thomas G. Allison and Co., of Maysville, \nBenton, County Ark, in which the latter was slain with a bowie-\nknife.  Some difficulty had for some time existed between the \nparties.  It is said that Major Gillespie brought on the attack \nwith a cane.  A severe conflict ensued, during which two pistols \nwere fired by Gillespie and one by Loose.  Loose then stabbed \nGillespie with one of those never-failing weapons, a bowie-knife.  \nThe death of Major G. is much regretted, as he was a liberal-minded \nand energetic man.  Since the above was in type, we have learned \nthat Major Allison has stated to some of our citizens in town that \nMr. Loose gave the first blow.  We forbear to give any particulars, \nas THE MATTER WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION.\'\n\n\n\'FOUL DEED.\n\n\nThe steamer Thames, just from Missouri river, brought us a \nhandbill, offering a reward of 500 dollars, for the person who \nassassinated Lilburn W. Baggs, late Governor of this State, at \nIndependence, on the night of the 6th inst.  Governor Baggs, it is \nstated in a written memorandum, was not dead, but mortally wounded.\n\n\'Since the above was written, we received a note from the clerk of \nthe Thames, giving the following particulars.  Gov. Baggs was shot \nby some villain on Friday, 6th inst., in the evening, while sitting \nin a room in his own house in Independence.  His son, a boy, \nhearing a report, ran into the room, and found the Governor sitting \nin his chair, with his jaw fallen down, and his head leaning back; \non discovering the injury done to his father, he gave the alarm.  \nFoot tracks were found in the garden below the window, and a pistol \npicked up supposed to have been overloaded, and thrown from the \nhand of the scoundrel who fired it.  Three buck shots of a heavy \nload, took effect; one going through his mouth, one into the brain, \nand another probably in or near the brain; all going into the back \npart of the neck and head.  The Governor was still alive on the \nmorning of the 7th; but no hopes for his recovery by his friends, \nand but slight hopes from his physicians.\n\n\'A man was suspected, and the Sheriff most probably has possession \nof him by this time.\n\n\'The pistol was one of a pair stolen some days previous from a \nbaker in Independence, and the legal authorities have the \ndescription of the other.\'\n\n\n\'RENCONTRE.\n\n\n\'An unfortunate AFFAIR took place on Friday evening in Chatres \nStreet, in which one of our most respectable citizens received a \ndangerous wound, from a poignard, in the abdomen.  From the Bee \n(New Orleans) of yesterday, we learn the following particulars.  It \nappears that an article was published in the French side of the \npaper on Monday last, containing some strictures on the Artillery \nBattalion for firing their guns on Sunday morning, in answer to \nthose from the Ontario and Woodbury, and thereby much alarm was \ncaused to the families of those persons who were out all night \npreserving the peace of the city.  Major C. Gally, Commander of the \nbattalion, resenting this, called at the office and demanded the \nauthor\'s name; that of Mr. P. Arpin was given to him, who was \nabsent at the time.  Some angry words then passed with one of the \nproprietors, and a challenge followed; the friends of both parties \ntried to arrange the affair, but failed to do so.  On Friday \nevening, about seven o\'clock, Major Gally met Mr. P. Arpin in \nChatres Street, and accosted him.  \"Are you Mr. Arpin?\"\n\n\'\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\'\"Then I have to tell you that you are a - \" (applying an \nappropriate epithet).\n\n\'\"I shall remind you of your words, sir.\"\n\n\'\"But I have said I would break my cane on your shoulders.\"\n\n\'\"I know it, but I have not yet received the blow.\"\n\n\'At these words, Major Gally, having a cane in his hands, struck \nMr. Arpin across the face, and the latter drew a poignard from his \npocket and stabbed Major Gally in the abdomen.\n\n\'Fears are entertained that the wound will be mortal.  WE \nUNDERSTAND THAT MR. ARPIN HAS GIVEN SECURITY FOR HIS APPEARANCE AT \nTHE CRIMINAL COURT TO ANSWER THE CHARGE.\'\n\n\n\'AFFRAY IN MISSISSIPPI.\n\n\n\'On the 27th ult., in an affray near Carthage, Leake county, \nMississippi, between James Cottingham and John Wilburn, the latter \nwas shot by the former, and so horribly wounded, that there was no \nhope of his recovery.  On the 2nd instant, there was an affray at \nCarthage between A. C. Sharkey and George Goff, in which the latter \nwas shot, and thought mortally wounded.  Sharkey delivered himself \nup to the authorities, BUT CHANGED HIS MIND AND ESCAPED!\'\n\n\n\'PERSONAL ENCOUNTER.\n\n\n\'An encounter took place in Sparta, a few days since, between the \nbarkeeper of an hotel, and a man named Bury.  It appears that Bury \nhad become somewhat noisy, AND THAT THE BARKEEPER, DETERMINED TO \nPRESERVE ORDER, HAD THREATENED TO SHOOT BURY, whereupon Bury drew a \npistol and shot the barkeeper down.  He was not dead at the last \naccounts, but slight hopes were entertained of his recovery.\'\n\n\n\'DUEL.\n\n\n\'The clerk of the steamboat TRIBUNE informs us that another duel \nwas fought on Tuesday last, by Mr. Robbins, a bank officer in \nVicksburg, and Mr. Fall, the editor of the Vicksburg Sentinel.  \nAccording to the arrangement, the parties had six pistols each, \nwhich, after the word \"Fire!\" THEY WERE TO DISCHARGE AS FAST AS \nTHEY PLEASED.  Fall fired two pistols without effect.  Mr. Robbins\' \nfirst shot took effect in Fall\'s thigh, who fell, and was unable to \ncontinue the combat.\'\n\n\n\'AFFRAY IN CLARKE COUNTY.\n\n\n\'An UNFORTUNATE AFFRAY occurred in Clarke county (MO.), near \nWaterloo, on Tuesday the 19th ult., which originated in settling \nthe partnership concerns of Messrs. M\'Kane and M\'Allister, who had \nbeen engaged in the business of distilling, and resulted in the \ndeath of the latter, who was shot down by Mr. M\'Kane, because of \nhis attempting to take possession of seven barrels of whiskey, the \nproperty of M\'Kane, which had been knocked off to M\'Allister at a \nsheriff\'s sale at one dollar per barrel.  M\'Kane immediately fled \nAND AT THE LATEST DATES HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN.\n\n\'THIS UNFORTUNATE AFFRAY caused considerable excitement in the \nneighbourhood, as both the parties were men with large families \ndepending upon them and stood well in the community.\'\n\n\nI will quote but one more paragraph, which, by reason of its \nmonstrous absurdity, may be a relief to these atrocious deeds.\n\n\n\'AFFAIR OF HONOUR.\n\n\n\'We have just heard the particulars of a meeting which took place \non Six Mile Island, on Tuesday, between two young bloods of our \ncity:  Samuel Thurston, AGED FIFTEEN, and William Hine, AGED \nTHIRTEEN years.  They were attended by young gentlemen of the same \nage.  The weapons used on the occasion, were a couple of Dickson\'s \nbest rifles; the distance, thirty yards.  They took one fire, \nwithout any damage being sustained by either party, except the ball \nof Thurston\'s gun passing through the crown of Hine\'s hat.  THROUGH \nTHE INTERCESSION OF THE BOARD OF HONOUR, the challenge was \nwithdrawn, and the difference amicably adjusted.\'\n\nIf the reader will picture to himself the kind of Board of Honour \nwhich amicably adjusted the difference between these two little \nboys, who in any other part of the world would have been amicably \nadjusted on two porters\' backs and soundly flogged with birchen \nrods, he will be possessed, no doubt, with as strong a sense of its \nludicrous character, as that which sets me laughing whenever its \nimage rises up before me.\n\nNow, I appeal to every human mind, imbued with the commonest of \ncommon sense, and the commonest of common humanity; to all \ndispassionate, reasoning creatures, of any shade of opinion; and \nask, with these revolting evidences of the state of society which \nexists in and about the slave districts of America before them, can \nthey have a doubt of the real condition of the slave, or can they \nfor a moment make a compromise between the institution or any of \nits flagrant, fearful features, and their own just consciences?  \nWill they say of any tale of cruelty and horror, however aggravated \nin degree, that it is improbable, when they can turn to the public \nprints, and, running, read such signs as these, laid before them by \nthe men who rule the slaves:  in their own acts and under their own \nhands?\n\nDo we not know that the worst deformity and ugliness of slavery are \nat once the cause and the effect of the reckless license taken by \nthese freeborn outlaws?  Do we not know that the man who has been \nborn and bred among its wrongs; who has seen in his childhood \nhusbands obliged at the word of command to flog their wives; women, \nindecently compelled to hold up their own garments that men might \nlay the heavier stripes upon their legs, driven and harried by \nbrutal overseers in their time of travail, and becoming mothers on \nthe field of toil, under the very lash itself; who has read in \nyouth, and seen his virgin sisters read, descriptions of runaway \nmen and women, and their disfigured persons, which could not be \npublished elsewhere, of so much stock upon a farm, or at a show of \nbeasts:- do we not know that that man, whenever his wrath is \nkindled up, will be a brutal savage?  Do we not know that as he is \na coward in his domestic life, stalking among his shrinking men and \nwomen slaves armed with his heavy whip, so he will be a coward out \nof doors, and carrying cowards\' weapons hidden in his breast, will \nshoot men down and stab them when he quarrels?  And if our reason \ndid not teach us this and much beyond; if we were such idiots as to \nclose our eyes to that fine mode of training which rears up such \nmen; should we not know that they who among their equals stab and \npistol in the legislative halls, and in the counting-house, and on \nthe marketplace, and in all the elsewhere peaceful pursuits of \nlife, must be to their dependants, even though they were free \nservants, so many merciless and unrelenting tyrants?\n\nWhat! shall we declaim against the ignorant peasantry of Ireland, \nand mince the matter when these American taskmasters are in \nquestion?  Shall we cry shame on the brutality of those who \nhamstring cattle:  and spare the lights of Freedom upon earth who \nnotch the ears of men and women, cut pleasant posies in the \nshrinking flesh, learn to write with pens of red-hot iron on the \nhuman face, rack their poetic fancies for liveries of mutilation \nwhich their slaves shall wear for life and carry to the grave, \nbreaking living limbs as did the soldiery who mocked and slew the \nSaviour of the world, and set defenceless creatures up for targets!  \nShall we whimper over legends of the tortures practised on each \nother by the Pagan Indians, and smile upon the cruelties of \nChristian men!  Shall we, so long as these things last, exult above \nthe scattered remnants of that race, and triumph in the white \nenjoyment of their possessions?  Rather, for me, restore the forest \nand the Indian village; in lieu of stars and stripes, let some poor \nfeather flutter in the breeze; replace the streets and squares by \nwigwams; and though the death-song of a hundred haughty warriors \nfill the air, it will be music to the shriek of one unhappy slave.\n\nOn one theme, which is commonly before our eyes, and in respect of \nwhich our national character is changing fast, let the plain Truth \nbe spoken, and let us not, like dastards, beat about the bush by \nhinting at the Spaniard and the fierce Italian.  When knives are \ndrawn by Englishmen in conflict let it be said and known:  \'We owe \nthis change to Republican Slavery.  These are the weapons of \nFreedom.  With sharp points and edges such as these, Liberty in \nAmerica hews and hacks her slaves; or, failing that pursuit, her \nsons devote them to a better use, and turn them on each other.\'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII - CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\n\n\nTHERE are many passages in this book, where I have been at some \npains to resist the temptation of troubling my readers with my own \ndeductions and conclusions:  preferring that they should judge for \nthemselves, from such premises as I have laid before them.  My only \nobject in the outset, was, to carry them with me faithfully \nwheresoever I went:  and that task I have discharged.\n\nBut I may be pardoned, if on such a theme as the general character \nof the American people, and the general character of their social \nsystem, as presented to a stranger\'s eyes, I desire to express my \nown opinions in a few words, before I bring these volumes to a \nclose.\n\nThey are, by nature, frank, brave, cordial, hospitable, and \naffectionate.  Cultivation and refinement seem but to enhance their \nwarmth of heart and ardent enthusiasm; and it is the possession of \nthese latter qualities in a most remarkable degree, which renders \nan educated American one of the most endearing and most generous of \nfriends.  I never was so won upon, as by this class; never yielded \nup my full confidence and esteem so readily and pleasurably, as to \nthem; never can make again, in half a year, so many friends for \nwhom I seem to entertain the regard of half a life.\n\nThese qualities are natural, I implicitly believe, to the whole \npeople.  That they are, however, sadly sapped and blighted in their \ngrowth among the mass; and that there are influences at work which \nendanger them still more, and give but little present promise of \ntheir healthy restoration; is a truth that ought to be told.\n\nIt is an essential part of every national character to pique itself \nmightily upon its faults, and to deduce tokens of its virtue or its \nwisdom from their very exaggeration.  One great blemish in the \npopular mind of America, and the prolific parent of an innumerable \nbrood of evils, is Universal Distrust.  Yet the American citizen \nplumes himself upon this spirit, even when he is sufficiently \ndispassionate to perceive the ruin it works; and will often adduce \nit, in spite of his own reason, as an instance of the great \nsagacity and acuteness of the people, and their superior shrewdness \nand independence.\n\n\'You carry,\' says the stranger, \'this jealousy and distrust into \nevery transaction of public life.  By repelling worthy men from \nyour legislative assemblies, it has bred up a class of candidates \nfor the suffrage, who, in their very act, disgrace your \nInstitutions and your people\'s choice.  It has rendered you so \nfickle, and so given to change, that your inconstancy has passed \ninto a proverb; for you no sooner set up an idol firmly, than you \nare sure to pull it down and dash it into fragments:  and this, \nbecause directly you reward a benefactor, or a public servant, you \ndistrust him, merely because he is rewarded; and immediately apply \nyourselves to find out, either that you have been too bountiful in \nyour acknowledgments, or he remiss in his deserts.  Any man who \nattains a high place among you, from the President downwards, may \ndate his downfall from that moment; for any printed lie that any \nnotorious villain pens, although it militate directly against the \ncharacter and conduct of a life, appeals at once to your distrust, \nand is believed.  You will strain at a gnat in the way of \ntrustfulness and confidence, however fairly won and well deserved; \nbut you will swallow a whole caravan of camels, if they be laden \nwith unworthy doubts and mean suspicions.  Is this well, think you, \nor likely to elevate the character of the governors or the \ngoverned, among you?\'\n\nThe answer is invariably the same:  \'There\'s freedom of opinion \nhere, you know.  Every man thinks for himself, and we are not to be \neasily overreached.  That\'s how our people come to be suspicious.\'\n\nAnother prominent feature is the love of \'smart\' dealing:  which \ngilds over many a swindle and gross breach of trust; many a \ndefalcation, public and private; and enables many a knave to hold \nhis head up with the best, who well deserves a halter; though it \nhas not been without its retributive operation, for this smartness \nhas done more in a few years to impair the public credit, and to \ncripple the public resources, than dull honesty, however rash, \ncould have effected in a century.  The merits of a broken \nspeculation, or a bankruptcy, or of a successful scoundrel, are not \ngauged by its or his observance of the golden rule, \'Do as you \nwould be done by,\' but are considered with reference to their \nsmartness.  I recollect, on both occasions of our passing that ill-\nfated Cairo on the Mississippi, remarking on the bad effects such \ngross deceits must have when they exploded, in generating a want of \nconfidence abroad, and discouraging foreign investment:  but I was \ngiven to understand that this was a very smart scheme by which a \ndeal of money had been made:  and that its smartest feature was, \nthat they forgot these things abroad, in a very short time, and \nspeculated again, as freely as ever.  The following dialogue I have \nheld a hundred times:  \'Is it not a very disgraceful circumstance \nthat such a man as So-and-so should be acquiring a large property \nby the most infamous and odious means, and notwithstanding all the \ncrimes of which he has been guilty, should be tolerated and abetted \nby your Citizens?  He is a public nuisance, is he not?\'  \'Yes, \nsir.\'  \'A convicted liar?\'  \'Yes, sir.\'  \'He has been kicked, and \ncuffed, and caned?\'  \'Yes, sir.\'  \'And he is utterly dishonourable, \ndebased, and profligate?\'  \'Yes, sir.\'  \'In the name of wonder, \nthen, what is his merit?\'  \'Well, sir, he is a smart man.\'\n\nIn like manner, all kinds of deficient and impolitic usages are \nreferred to the national love of trade; though, oddly enough, it \nwould be a weighty charge against a foreigner that he regarded the \nAmericans as a trading people.  The love of trade is assigned as a \nreason for that comfortless custom, so very prevalent in country \ntowns, of married persons living in hotels, having no fireside of \ntheir own, and seldom meeting from early morning until late at \nnight, but at the hasty public meals.  The love of trade is a \nreason why the literature of America is to remain for ever \nunprotected \'For we are a trading people, and don\'t care for \npoetry:\' though we DO, by the way, profess to be very proud of our \npoets:  while healthful amusements, cheerful means of recreation, \nand wholesome fancies, must fade before the stern utilitarian joys \nof trade.\n\nThese three characteristics are strongly presented at every turn, \nfull in the stranger\'s view.  But, the foul growth of America has a \nmore tangled root than this; and it strikes its fibres, deep in its \nlicentious Press.\n\nSchools may be erected, East, West, North, and South; pupils be \ntaught, and masters reared, by scores upon scores of thousands; \ncolleges may thrive, churches may be crammed, temperance may be \ndiffused, and advancing knowledge in all other forms walk through \nthe land with giant strides:  but while the newspaper press of \nAmerica is in, or near, its present abject state, high moral \nimprovement in that country is hopeless.  Year by year, it must and \nwill go back; year by year, the tone of public feeling must sink \nlower down; year by year, the Congress and the Senate must become \nof less account before all decent men; and year by year, the memory \nof the Great Fathers of the Revolution must be outraged more and \nmore, in the bad life of their degenerate child.\n\nAmong the herd of journals which are published in the States, there \nare some, the reader scarcely need be told, of character and \ncredit.  From personal intercourse with accomplished gentlemen \nconnected with publications of this class, I have derived both \npleasure and profit.  But the name of these is Few, and of the \nothers Legion; and the influence of the good, is powerless to \ncounteract the moral poison of the bad.\n\nAmong the gentry of America; among the well-informed and moderate:  \nin the learned professions; at the bar and on the bench:  there is, \nas there can be, but one opinion, in reference to the vicious \ncharacter of these infamous journals.  It is sometimes contended - \nI will not say strangely, for it is natural to seek excuses for \nsuch a disgrace - that their influence is not so great as a visitor \nwould suppose.  I must be pardoned for saying that there is no \nwarrant for this plea, and that every fact and circumstance tends \ndirectly to the opposite conclusion.\n\nWhen any man, of any grade of desert in intellect or character, can \nclimb to any public distinction, no matter what, in America, \nwithout first grovelling down upon the earth, and bending the knee \nbefore this monster of depravity; when any private excellence is \nsafe from its attacks; when any social confidence is left unbroken \nby it, or any tie of social decency and honour is held in the least \nregard; when any man in that free country has freedom of opinion, \nand presumes to think for himself, and speak for himself, without \nhumble reference to a censorship which, for its rampant ignorance \nand base dishonesty, he utterly loathes and despises in his heart; \nwhen those who most acutely feel its infamy and the reproach it \ncasts upon the nation, and who most denounce it to each other, dare \nto set their heels upon, and crush it openly, in the sight of all \nmen:  then, I will believe that its influence is lessening, and men \nare returning to their manly senses.  But while that Press has its \nevil eye in every house, and its black hand in every appointment in \nthe state, from a president to a postman; while, with ribald \nslander for its only stock in trade, it is the standard literature \nof an enormous class, who must find their reading in a newspaper, \nor they will not read at all; so long must its odium be upon the \ncountry\'s head, and so long must the evil it works, be plainly \nvisible in the Republic.\n\nTo those who are accustomed to the leading English journals, or to \nthe respectable journals of the Continent of Europe; to those who \nare accustomed to anything else in print and paper; it would be \nimpossible, without an amount of extract for which I have neither \nspace nor inclination, to convey an adequate idea of this frightful \nengine in America.  But if any man desire confirmation of my \nstatement on this head, let him repair to any place in this city of \nLondon, where scattered numbers of these publications are to be \nfound; and there, let him form his own opinion. (1)\n\nIt would be well, there can be no doubt, for the American people as \na whole, if they loved the Real less, and the Ideal somewhat more.  \nIt would be well, if there were greater encouragement to lightness \nof heart and gaiety, and a wider cultivation of what is beautiful, \nwithout being eminently and directly useful.  But here, I think the \ngeneral remonstrance, \'we are a new country,\' which is so often \nadvanced as an excuse for defects which are quite unjustifiable, as \nbeing, of right, only the slow growth of an old one, may be very \nreasonably urged:  and I yet hope to hear of there being some other \nnational amusement in the United States, besides newspaper \npolitics.\n\nThey certainly are not a humorous people, and their temperament \nalways impressed me is being of a dull and gloomy character.  In \nshrewdness of remark, and a certain cast-iron quaintness, the \nYankees, or people of New England, unquestionably take the lead; as \nthey do in most other evidences of intelligence.  But in travelling \nabout, out of the large cities - as I have remarked in former parts \nof these volumes - I was quite oppressed by the prevailing \nseriousness and melancholy air of business:  which was so general \nand unvarying, that at every new town I came to, I seemed to meet \nthe very same people whom I had left behind me, at the last.  Such \ndefects as are perceptible in the national manners, seem, to me, to \nbe referable, in a great degree, to this cause:  which has \ngenerated a dull, sullen persistence in coarse usages, and rejected \nthe graces of life as undeserving of attention.  There is no doubt \nthat Washington, who was always most scrupulous and exact on points \nof ceremony, perceived the tendency towards this mistake, even in \nhis time, and did his utmost to correct it.\n\nI cannot hold with other writers on these subjects that the \nprevalence of various forms of dissent in America, is in any way \nattributable to the non-existence there of an established church:  \nindeed, I think the temper of the people, if it admitted of such an \nInstitution being founded amongst them, would lead them to desert \nit, as a matter of course, merely because it WAS established.  But, \nsupposing it to exist, I doubt its probable efficacy in summoning \nthe wandering sheep to one great fold, simply because of the \nimmense amount of dissent which prevails at home; and because I do \nnot find in America any one form of religion with which we in \nEurope, or even in England, are unacquainted.  Dissenters resort \nthither in great numbers, as other people do, simply because it is \na land of resort; and great settlements of them are founded, \nbecause ground can be purchased, and towns and villages reared, \nwhere there were none of the human creation before.  But even the \nShakers emigrated from England; our country is not unknown to Mr. \nJoseph Smith, the apostle of Mormonism, or to his benighted \ndisciples; I have beheld religious scenes myself in some of our \npopulous towns which can hardly be surpassed by an American camp-\nmeeting; and I am not aware that any instance of superstitious \nimposture on the one hand, and superstitious credulity on the \nother, has had its origin in the United States, which we cannot \nmore than parallel by the precedents of Mrs. Southcote, Mary Tofts \nthe rabbit-breeder, or even Mr. Thorn of Canterbury:  which latter \ncase arose, some time after the dark ages had passed away.\n\nThe Republican Institutions of America undoubtedly lead the people \nto assert their self-respect and their equality; but a traveller is \nbound to bear those Institutions in his mind, and not hastily to \nresent the near approach of a class of strangers, who, at home, \nwould keep aloof.  This characteristic, when it was tinctured with \nno foolish pride, and stopped short of no honest service, never \noffended me; and I very seldom, if ever, experienced its rude or \nunbecoming display.  Once or twice it was comically developed, as \nin the following case; but this was an amusing incident, and not \nthe rule, or near it.\n\nI wanted a pair of boots at a certain town, for I had none to \ntravel in, but those with the memorable cork soles, which were much \ntoo hot for the fiery decks of a steamboat.  I therefore sent a \nmessage to an artist in boots, importing, with my compliments, that \nI should be happy to see him, if he would do me the polite favour \nto call.  He very kindly returned for answer, that he would \'look \nround\' at six o\'clock that evening.\n\nI was lying on the sofa, with a book and a wine-glass, at about \nthat time, when the door opened, and a gentleman in a stiff cravat, \nwithin a year or two on either side of thirty, entered, in his hat \nand gloves; walked up to the looking-glass; arranged his hair; took \noff his gloves; slowly produced a measure from the uttermost depths \nof his coat-pocket; and requested me, in a languid tone, to \'unfix\' \nmy straps.  I complied, but looked with some curiosity at his hat, \nwhich was still upon his head.  It might have been that, or it \nmight have been the heat - but he took it off.  Then, he sat \nhimself down on a chair opposite to me; rested an arm on each knee; \nand, leaning forward very much, took from the ground, by a great \neffort, the specimen of metropolitan workmanship which I had just \npulled off:  whistling, pleasantly, as he did so.  He turned it \nover and over; surveyed it with a contempt no language can express; \nand inquired if I wished him to fix me a boot like THAT?  I \ncourteously replied, that provided the boots were large enough, I \nwould leave the rest to him; that if convenient and practicable, I \nshould not object to their bearing some resemblance to the model \nthen before him; but that I would be entirely guided by, and would \nbeg to leave the whole subject to, his judgment and discretion.  \n\'You an\'t partickler, about this scoop in the heel, I suppose \nthen?\' says he:  \'we don\'t foller that, here.\'  I repeated my last \nobservation.  He looked at himself in the glass again; went closer \nto it to dash a grain or two of dust out of the corner of his eye; \nand settled his cravat.  All this time, my leg and foot were in the \nair.  \'Nearly ready, sir?\' I inquired.  \'Well, pretty nigh,\' he \nsaid; \'keep steady.\'  I kept as steady as I could, both in foot and \nface; and having by this time got the dust out, and found his \npencil-case, he measured me, and made the necessary notes.  When he \nhad finished, he fell into his old attitude, and taking up the boot \nagain, mused for some time.  \'And this,\' he said, at last, \'is an \nEnglish boot, is it?  This is a London boot, eh?\'  \'That, sir,\' I \nreplied, \'is a London boot.\'  He mused over it again, after the \nmanner of Hamlet with Yorick\'s skull; nodded his head, as who \nshould say, \'I pity the Institutions that led to the production of \nthis boot!\'; rose; put up his pencil, notes, and paper - glancing \nat himself in the glass, all the time - put on his hat - drew on \nhis gloves very slowly; and finally walked out.  When he had been \ngone about a minute, the door reopened, and his hat and his head \nreappeared.  He looked round the room, and at the boot again, which \nwas still lying on the floor; appeared thoughtful for a minute; and \nthen said \'Well, good arternoon.\'  \'Good afternoon, sir,\' said I:  \nand that was the end of the interview.\n\nThere is but one other head on which I wish to offer a remark; and \nthat has reference to the public health.  In so vast a country, \nwhere there are thousands of millions of acres of land yet \nunsettled and uncleared, and on every rood of which, vegetable \ndecomposition is annually taking place; where there are so many \ngreat rivers, and such opposite varieties of climate; there cannot \nfail to be a great amount of sickness at certain seasons.  But I \nmay venture to say, after conversing with many members of the \nmedical profession in America, that I am not singular in the \nopinion that much of the disease which does prevail, might be \navoided, if a few common precautions were observed.  Greater means \nof personal cleanliness, are indispensable to this end; the custom \nof hastily swallowing large quantities of animal food, three times \na-day, and rushing back to sedentary pursuits after each meal, must \nbe changed; the gentler sex must go more wisely clad, and take more \nhealthful exercise; and in the latter clause, the males must be \nincluded also.  Above all, in public institutions, and throughout \nthe whole of every town and city, the system of ventilation, and \ndrainage, and removal of impurities requires to be thoroughly \nrevised.  There is no local Legislature in America which may not \nstudy Mr. Chadwick\'s excellent Report upon the Sanitary Condition \nof our Labouring Classes, with immense advantage.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nI HAVE now arrived at the close of this book.  I have little reason \nto believe, from certain warnings I have had since I returned to \nEngland, that it will be tenderly or favourably received by the \nAmerican people; and as I have written the Truth in relation to the \nmass of those who form their judgments and express their opinions, \nit will be seen that I have no desire to court, by any adventitious \nmeans, the popular applause.\n\nIt is enough for me, to know, that what I have set down in these \npages, cannot cost me a single friend on the other side of the \nAtlantic, who is, in anything, deserving of the name.  For the \nrest, I put my trust, implicitly, in the spirit in which they have \nbeen conceived and penned; and I can bide my time.\n\nI have made no reference to my reception, nor have I suffered it to \ninfluence me in what I have written; for, in either case, I should \nhave offered but a sorry acknowledgment, compared with that I bear \nwithin my breast, towards those partial readers of my former books, \nacross the Water, who met me with an open hand, and not with one \nthat closed upon an iron muzzle.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\nPOSTSCRIPT\n\n\n\nAT a Public Dinner given to me on Saturday the 18th of April, 1868, \nin the City of New York, by two hundred representatives of the \nPress of the United States of America, I made the following \nobservations among others:\n\n\'So much of my voice has lately been heard in the land, that I \nmight have been contented with troubling you no further from my \npresent standing-point, were it not a duty with which I henceforth \ncharge myself, not only here but on every suitable occasion, \nwhatsoever and wheresoever, to express my high and grateful sense \nof my second reception in America, and to bear my honest testimony \nto the national generosity and magnanimity.  Also, to declare how \nastounded I have been by the amazing changes I have seen around me \non every side, - changes moral, changes physical, changes in the \namount of land subdued and peopled, changes in the rise of vast new \ncities, changes in the growth of older cities almost out of \nrecognition, changes in the graces and amenities of life, changes \nin the Press, without whose advancement no advancement can take \nplace anywhere.  Nor am I, believe me, so arrogant as to suppose \nthat in five and twenty years there have been no changes in me, and \nthat I had nothing to learn and no extreme impressions to correct \nwhen I was here first.  And this brings me to a point on which I \nhave, ever since I landed in the United States last November, \nobserved a strict silence, though sometimes tempted to break it, \nbut in reference to which I will, with your good leave, take you \ninto my confidence now.  Even the Press, being human, may be \nsometimes mistaken or misinformed, and I rather think that I have \nin one or two rare instances observed its information to be not \nstrictly accurate with reference to myself.  Indeed, I have, now \nand again, been more surprised by printed news that I have read of \nmyself, than by any printed news that I have ever read in my \npresent state of existence.  Thus, the vigour and perseverance with \nwhich I have for some months past been collecting materials for, \nand hammering away at, a new book on America has much astonished \nme; seeing that all that time my declaration has been perfectly \nwell known to my publishers on both sides of the Atlantic, that no \nconsideration on earth would induce me to write one.  But what I \nhave intended, what I have resolved upon (and this is the \nconfidence I seek to place in you) is, on my return to England, in \nmy own person, in my own journal, to bear, for the behoof of my \ncountrymen, such testimony to the gigantic changes in this country \nas I have hinted at to-night.  Also, to record that wherever I have \nbeen, in the smallest places equally with the largest, I have been \nreceived with unsurpassable politeness, delicacy, sweet temper, \nhospitality, consideration, and with unsurpassable respect for the \nprivacy daily enforced upon me by the nature of my avocation here \nand the state of my health.  This testimony, so long as I live, and \nso long as my descendants have any legal right in my books, I shall \ncause to be republished, as an appendix to every copy of those two \nbooks of mine in which I have referred to America.  And this I will \ndo and cause to be done, not in mere love and thankfulness, but \nbecause I regard it as an act of plain justice and honour.\'\n\nI said these words with the greatest earnestness that I could lay \nupon them, and I repeat them in print here with equal earnestness.  \nSo long as this book shall last, I hope that they will form a part \nof it, and will be fairly read as inseparable from my experiences \nand impressions of America.\n\nCHARLES DICKENS.\n\nMAY, 1868.\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n(1) NOTE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION. - Or let him refer to an able, \nand perfectly truthful article, in THE FOREIGN QUARTERLY REVIEW, \npublished in the present month of October; to which my attention \nhas been attracted, since these sheets have been passing through \nthe press.

It was fought \nupon a long summer day when the waving grass was green.  Many a \nwild flower formed by the Almighty Hand to be a perfumed goblet for \nthe dew, felt its enamelled cup filled high with blood that day, \nand shrinking dropped.  Many an insect deriving its delicate colour \nfrom harmless leaves and herbs, was stained anew that day by dying \nmen, and marked its frightened way with an unnatural track.  The \npainted butterfly took blood into the air upon the edges of its \nwings.  The stream ran red.  The trodden ground became a quagmire, \nwhence, from sullen pools collected in the prints of human feet and \nhorses\' hoofs, the one prevailing hue still lowered and glimmered \nat the sun.\n\nHeaven keep us from a knowledge of the sights the moon beheld upon \nthat field, when, coming up above the black line of distant rising-\nground, softened and blurred at the edge by trees, she rose into \nthe sky and looked upon the plain, strewn with upturned faces that \nhad once at mothers\' breasts sought mothers\' eyes, or slumbered \nhappily.  Heaven keep us from a knowledge of the secrets whispered \nafterwards upon the tainted wind that blew across the scene of that \nday\'s work and that night\'s death and suffering!  Many a lonely \nmoon was bright upon the battle-ground, and many a star kept \nmournful watch upon it, and many a wind from every quarter of the \nearth blew over it, before the traces of the fight were worn away.\n\nThey lurked and lingered for a long time, but survived in little \nthings; for, Nature, far above the evil passions of men, soon \nrecovered Her serenity, and smiled upon the guilty battle-ground as \nshe had done before, when it was innocent.  The larks sang high \nabove it; the swallows skimmed and dipped and flitted to and fro; \nthe shadows of the flying clouds pursued each other swiftly, over \ngrass and corn and turnip-field and wood, and over roof and church-\nspire in the nestling town among the trees, away into the bright \ndistance on the borders of the sky and earth, where the red sunsets \nfaded.  Crops were sown, and grew up, and were gathered in; the \nstream that had been crimsoned, turned a watermill; men whistled at \nthe plough; gleaners and haymakers were seen in quiet groups at \nwork; sheep and oxen pastured; boys whooped and called, in fields, \nto scare away the birds; smoke rose from cottage chimneys; sabbath \nbells rang peacefully; old people lived and died; the timid \ncreatures of the field, the simple flowers of the bush and garden, \ngrew and withered in their destined terms:  and all upon the fierce \nand bloody battle-ground, where thousands upon thousands had been \nkilled in the great fight.  But, there were deep green patches in \nthe growing corn at first, that people looked at awfully.  Year \nafter year they re-appeared; and it was known that underneath those \nfertile spots, heaps of men and horses lay buried, \nindiscriminately, enriching the ground.  The husbandmen who \nploughed those places, shrunk from the great worms abounding there; \nand the sheaves they yielded, were, for many a long year, called \nthe Battle Sheaves, and set apart; and no one ever knew a Battle \nSheaf to be among the last load at a Harvest Home.  For a long \ntime, every furrow that was turned, revealed some fragments of the \nfight.  For a long time, there were wounded trees upon the battle-\nground; and scraps of hacked and broken fence and wall, where \ndeadly struggles had been made; and trampled parts where not a leaf \nor blade would grow.  For a long time, no village girl would dress \nher hair or bosom with the sweetest flower from that field of \ndeath:  and after many a year had come and gone, the berries \ngrowing there, were still believed to leave too deep a stain upon \nthe hand that plucked them.\n\nThe Seasons in their course, however, though they passed as lightly \nas the summer clouds themselves, obliterated, in the lapse of time, \neven these remains of the old conflict; and wore away such \nlegendary traces of it as the neighbouring people carried in their \nminds, until they dwindled into old wives\' tales, dimly remembered \nround the winter fire, and waning every year.  Where the wild \nflowers and berries had so long remained upon the stem untouched, \ngardens arose, and houses were built, and children played at \nbattles on the turf.  The wounded trees had long ago made Christmas \nlogs, and blazed and roared away.  The deep green patches were no \ngreener now than the memory of those who lay in dust below.  The \nploughshare still turned up from time to time some rusty bits of \nmetal, but it was hard to say what use they had ever served, and \nthose who found them wondered and disputed.  An old dinted \ncorselet, and a helmet, had been hanging in the church so long, \nthat the same weak half-blind old man who tried in vain to make \nthem out above the whitewashed arch, had marvelled at them as a \nbaby.  If the host slain upon the field, could have been for a \nmoment reanimated in the forms in which they fell, each upon the \nspot that was the bed of his untimely death, gashed and ghastly \nsoldiers would have stared in, hundreds deep, at household door and \nwindow; and would have risen on the hearths of quiet homes; and \nwould have been the garnered store of barns and granaries; and \nwould have started up between the cradled infant and its nurse; and \nwould have floated with the stream, and whirled round on the mill, \nand crowded the orchard, and burdened the meadow, and piled the \nrickyard high with dying men.  So altered was the battle-ground, \nwhere thousands upon thousands had been killed in the great fight.\n\nNowhere more altered, perhaps, about a hundred years ago, than in \none little orchard attached to an old stone house with a \nhoneysuckle porch; where, on a bright autumn morning, there were \nsounds of music and laughter, and where two girls danced merrily \ntogether on the grass, while some half-dozen peasant women standing \non ladders, gathering the apples from the trees, stopped in their \nwork to look down, and share their enjoyment.  It was a pleasant, \nlively, natural scene; a beautiful day, a retired spot; and the two \ngirls, quite unconstrained and careless, danced in the freedom and \ngaiety of their hearts.\n\nIf there were no such thing as display in the world, my private \nopinion is, and I hope you agree with me, that we might get on a \ngreat deal better than we do, and might be infinitely more \nagreeable company than we are.  It was charming to see how these \ngirls danced.  They had no spectators but the apple-pickers on the \nladders.  They were very glad to please them, but they danced to \nplease themselves (or at least you would have supposed so); and you \ncould no more help admiring, than they could help dancing.  How \nthey did dance!\n\nNot like opera-dancers.  Not at all.  And not like Madame Anybody\'s \nfinished pupils.  Not the least.  It was not quadrille dancing, nor \nminuet dancing, nor even country-dance dancing.  It was neither in \nthe old style, nor the new style, nor the French style, nor the \nEnglish style:  though it may have been, by accident, a trifle in \nthe Spanish style, which is a free and joyous one, I am told, \nderiving a delightful air of off-hand inspiration, from the \nchirping little castanets.  As they danced among the orchard trees, \nand down the groves of stems and back again, and twirled each other \nlightly round and round, the influence of their airy motion seemed \nto spread and spread, in the sun-lighted scene, like an expanding \ncircle in the water.  Their streaming hair and fluttering skirts, \nthe elastic grass beneath their feet, the boughs that rustled in \nthe morning air - the flashing leaves, the speckled shadows on the \nsoft green ground - the balmy wind that swept along the landscape, \nglad to turn the distant windmill, cheerily - everything between \nthe two girls, and the man and team at plough upon the ridge of \nland, where they showed against the sky as if they were the last \nthings in the world - seemed dancing too.\n\nAt last, the younger of the dancing sisters, out of breath, and \nlaughing gaily, threw herself upon a bench to rest.  The other \nleaned against a tree hard by.  The music, a wandering harp and \nfiddle, left off with a flourish, as if it boasted of its \nfreshness; though the truth is, it had gone at such a pace, and \nworked itself to such a pitch of competition with the dancing, that \nit never could have held on, half a minute longer.  The apple-\npickers on the ladders raised a hum and murmur of applause, and \nthen, in keeping with the sound, bestirred themselves to work again \nlike bees.\n\nThe more actively, perhaps, because an elderly gentleman, who was \nno other than Doctor Jeddler himself - it was Doctor Jeddler\'s \nhouse and orchard, you should know, and these were Doctor Jeddler\'s \ndaughters - came bustling out to see what was the matter, and who \nthe deuce played music on his property, before breakfast.  For he \nwas a great philosopher, Doctor Jeddler, and not very musical.\n\n\'Music and dancing TO-DAY!\' said the Doctor, stopping short, and \nspeaking to himself.  \'I thought they dreaded to-day.  But it\'s a \nworld of contradictions.  Why, Grace, why, Marion!\' he added, \naloud, \'is the world more mad than usual this morning?\'\n\n\'Make some allowance for it, father, if it be,\' replied his younger \ndaughter, Marion, going close to him, and looking into his face, \n\'for it\'s somebody\'s birth-day.\'\n\n\'Somebody\'s birth-day, Puss!\' replied the Doctor.  \'Don\'t you know \nit\'s always somebody\'s birth-day?  Did you never hear how many new \nperformers enter on this - ha! ha! ha! - it\'s impossible to speak \ngravely of it - on this preposterous and ridiculous business called \nLife, every minute?\'\n\n\'No, father!\'\n\n\'No, not you, of course; you\'re a woman - almost,\' said the Doctor.  \n\'By-the-by,\' and he looked into the pretty face, still close to \nhis, \'I suppose it\'s YOUR birth-day.\'\n\n\'No!  Do you really, father?\' cried his pet daughter, pursing up \nher red lips to be kissed.\n\n\'There!  Take my love with it,\' said the Doctor, imprinting his \nupon them; \'and many happy returns of the - the idea! - of the day.  \nThe notion of wishing happy returns in such a farce as this,\' said \nthe Doctor to himself, \'is good!  Ha! ha! ha!\'\n\nDoctor Jeddler was, as I have said, a great philosopher, and the \nheart and mystery of his philosophy was, to look upon the world as \na gigantic practical joke; as something too absurd to be considered \nseriously, by any rational man.  His system of belief had been, in \nthe beginning, part and parcel of the battle-ground on which he \nlived, as you shall presently understand.\n\n\'Well!  But how did you get the music?\' asked the Doctor.  \n\'Poultry-stealers, of course!  Where did the minstrels come from?\'\n\n\'Alfred sent the music,\' said his daughter Grace, adjusting a few \nsimple flowers in her sister\'s hair, with which, in her admiration \nof that youthful beauty, she had herself adorned it half-an-hour \nbefore, and which the dancing had disarranged.\n\n\'Oh!  Alfred sent the music, did he?\' returned the Doctor.\n\n\'Yes.  He met it coming out of the town as he was entering early.  \nThe men are travelling on foot, and rested there last night; and as \nit was Marion\'s birth-day, and he thought it would please her, he \nsent them on, with a pencilled note to me, saying that if I thought \nso too, they had come to serenade her.\'\n\n\'Ay, ay,\' said the Doctor, carelessly, \'he always takes your \nopinion.\'\n\n\'And my opinion being favourable,\' said Grace, good-humouredly; and \npausing for a moment to admire the pretty head she decorated, with \nher own thrown back; \'and Marion being in high spirits, and \nbeginning to dance, I joined her.  And so we danced to Alfred\'s \nmusic till we were out of breath.  And we thought the music all the \ngayer for being sent by Alfred.  Didn\'t we, dear Marion?\'\n\n\'Oh, I don\'t know, Grace.  How you tease me about Alfred.\'\n\n\'Tease you by mentioning your lover?\' said her sister.\n\n\'I am sure I don\'t much care to have him mentioned,\' said the \nwilful beauty, stripping the petals from some flowers she held, and \nscattering them on the ground.  \'I am almost tired of hearing of \nhim; and as to his being my lover - \'\n\n\'Hush!  Don\'t speak lightly of a true heart, which is all your own, \nMarion,\' cried her sister, \'even in jest.  There is not a truer \nheart than Alfred\'s in the world!\'\n\n\'No-no,\' said Marion, raising her eyebrows with a pleasant air of \ncareless consideration, \'perhaps not.  But I don\'t know that \nthere\'s any great merit in that.  I - I don\'t want him to be so \nvery true.  I never asked him.  If he expects that I -  But, dear \nGrace, why need we talk of him at all, just now!\'\n\nIt was agreeable to see the graceful figures of the blooming \nsisters, twined together, lingering among the trees, conversing \nthus, with earnestness opposed to lightness, yet, with love \nresponding tenderly to love.  And it was very curious indeed to see \nthe younger sister\'s eyes suffused with tears, and something \nfervently and deeply felt, breaking through the wilfulness of what \nshe said, and striving with it painfully.\n\nThe difference between them, in respect of age, could not exceed \nfour years at most; but Grace, as often happens in such cases, when \nno mother watches over both (the Doctor\'s wife was dead), seemed, \nin her gentle care of her young sister, and in the steadiness of \nher devotion to her, older than she was; and more removed, in \ncourse of nature, from all competition with her, or participation, \notherwise than through her sympathy and true affection, in her \nwayward fancies, than their ages seemed to warrant.  Great \ncharacter of mother, that, even in this shadow and faint reflection \nof it, purifies the heart, and raises the exalted nature nearer to \nthe angels!\n\nThe Doctor\'s reflections, as he looked after them, and heard the \npurport of their discourse, were limited at first to certain merry \nmeditations on the folly of all loves and likings, and the idle \nimposition practised on themselves by young people, who believed \nfor a moment, that there could be anything serious in such bubbles, \nand were always undeceived - always!\n\nBut, the home-adorning, self-denying qualities of Grace, and her \nsweet temper, so gentle and retiring, yet including so much \nconstancy and bravery of spirit, seemed all expressed to him in the \ncontrast between her quiet household figure and that of his younger \nand more beautiful child; and he was sorry for her sake - sorry for \nthem both - that life should be such a very ridiculous business as \nit was.\n\nThe Doctor never dreamed of inquiring whether his children, or \neither of them, helped in any way to make the scheme a serious one.  \nBut then he was a Philosopher.\n\nA kind and generous man by nature, he had stumbled, by chance, over \nthat common Philosopher\'s stone (much more easily discovered than \nthe object of the alchemist\'s researches), which sometimes trips up \nkind and generous men, and has the fatal property of turning gold \nto dross and every precious thing to poor account.\n\n\'Britain!\' cried the Doctor.  \'Britain!  Holloa!\'\n\nA small man, with an uncommonly sour and discontented face, emerged \nfrom the house, and returned to this call the unceremonious \nacknowledgment of \'Now then!\'\n\n\'Where\'s the breakfast table?\' said the Doctor.\n\n\'In the house,\' returned Britain.\n\n\'Are you going to spread it out here, as you were told last night?\' \nsaid the Doctor.  \'Don\'t you know that there are gentlemen coming?  \nThat there\'s business to be done this morning, before the coach \ncomes by?  That this is a very particular occasion?\'\n\n\'I couldn\'t do anything, Dr. Jeddler, till the women had done \ngetting in the apples, could I?\' said Britain, his voice rising \nwith his reasoning, so that it was very loud at last.\n\n\'Well, have they done now?\' replied the Doctor, looking at his \nwatch, and clapping his hands.  \'Come! make haste! where\'s \nClemency?\'\n\n\'Here am I, Mister,\' said a voice from one of the ladders, which a \npair of clumsy feet descended briskly.  \'It\'s all done now.  Clear \naway, gals.  Everything shall be ready for you in half a minute, \nMister.\'\n\nWith that she began to bustle about most vigorously; presenting, as \nshe did so, an appearance sufficiently peculiar to justify a word \nof introduction.\n\nShe was about thirty years old, and had a sufficiently plump and \ncheerful face, though it was twisted up into an odd expression of \ntightness that made it comical.  But, the extraordinary homeliness \nof her gait and manner, would have superseded any face in the \nworld.  To say that she had two left legs, and somebody else\'s \narms, and that all four limbs seemed to be out of joint, and to \nstart from perfectly wrong places when they were set in motion, is \nto offer the mildest outline of the reality.  To say that she was \nperfectly content and satisfied with these arrangements, and \nregarded them as being no business of hers, and that she took her \narms and legs as they came, and allowed them to dispose of \nthemselves just as it happened, is to render faint justice to her \nequanimity.  Her dress was a prodigious pair of self-willed shoes, \nthat never wanted to go where her feet went; blue stockings; a \nprinted gown of many colours, and the most hideous pattern \nprocurable for money; and a white apron.  She always wore short \nsleeves, and always had, by some accident, grazed elbows, in which \nshe took so lively an interest, that she was continually trying to \nturn them round and get impossible views of them.  In general, a \nlittle cap placed somewhere on her head; though it was rarely to be \nmet with in the place usually occupied in other subjects, by that \narticle of dress; but, from head to foot she was scrupulously \nclean, and maintained a kind of dislocated tidiness.  Indeed, her \nlaudable anxiety to be tidy and compact in her own conscience as \nwell as in the public eye, gave rise to one of her most startling \nevolutions, which was to grasp herself sometimes by a sort of \nwooden handle (part of her clothing, and familiarly called a busk), \nand wrestle as it were with her garments, until they fell into a \nsymmetrical arrangement.\n\nSuch, in outward form and garb, was Clemency Newcome; who was \nsupposed to have unconsciously originated a corruption of her own \nChristian name, from Clementina (but nobody knew, for the deaf old \nmother, a very phenomenon of age, whom she had supported almost \nfrom a child, was dead, and she had no other relation); who now \nbusied herself in preparing the table, and who stood, at intervals, \nwith her bare red arms crossed, rubbing her grazed elbows with \nopposite hands, and staring at it very composedly, until she \nsuddenly remembered something else she wanted, and jogged off to \nfetch it.\n\n\'Here are them two lawyers a-coming, Mister!\' said Clemency, in a \ntone of no very great good-will.\n\n\'Ah!\' cried the Doctor, advancing to the gate to meet them.  \'Good \nmorning, good morning!  Grace, my dear!  Marion!  Here are Messrs. \nSnitchey and Craggs.  Where\'s Alfred!\'\n\n\'He\'ll be back directly, father, no doubt,\' said Grace.  \'He had so \nmuch to do this morning in his preparations for departure, that he \nwas up and out by daybreak.  Good morning, gentlemen.\'\n\n\'Ladies!\' said Mr. Snitchey, \'for Self and Craggs,\' who bowed, \n\'good morning!  Miss,\' to Marion, \'I kiss your hand.\'  Which he \ndid.  \'And I wish you\' - which he might or might not, for he didn\'t \nlook, at first sight, like a gentleman troubled with many warm \noutpourings of soul, in behalf of other people, \'a hundred happy \nreturns of this auspicious day.\'\n\n\'Ha ha ha!\' laughed the Doctor thoughtfully, with his hands in his \npockets.  \'The great farce in a hundred acts!\'\n\n\'You wouldn\'t, I am sure,\' said Mr. Snitchey, standing a small \nprofessional blue bag against one leg of the table, \'cut the great \nfarce short for this actress, at all events, Doctor Jeddler.\'\n\n\'No,\' returned the Doctor.  \'God forbid!  May she live to laugh at \nit, as long as she CAN laugh, and then say, with the French wit, \n\"The farce is ended; draw the curtain.\"\'\n\n\'The French wit,\' said Mr. Snitchey, peeping sharply into his blue \nbag, \'was wrong, Doctor Jeddler, and your philosophy is altogether \nwrong, depend upon it, as I have often told you.  Nothing serious \nin life!  What do you call law?\'\n\n\'A joke,\' replied the Doctor.\n\n\'Did you ever go to law?\' asked Mr. Snitchey, looking out of the \nblue bag.\n\n\'Never,\' returned the Doctor.\n\n\'If you ever do,\' said Mr. Snitchey, \'perhaps you\'ll alter that \nopinion.\'\n\nCraggs, who seemed to be represented by Snitchey, and to be \nconscious of little or no separate existence or personal \nindividuality, offered a remark of his own in this place.  It \ninvolved the only idea of which he did not stand seized and \npossessed in equal moieties with Snitchey; but, he had some \npartners in it among the wise men of the world.\n\n\'It\'s made a great deal too easy,\' said Mr. Craggs.\n\n\'Law is?\' asked the Doctor.\n\n\'Yes,\' said Mr. Craggs, \'everything is.  Everything appears to me \nto be made too easy, now-a-days.  It\'s the vice of these times.  If \nthe world is a joke (I am not prepared to say it isn\'t), it ought \nto be made a very difficult joke to crack.  It ought to be as hard \na struggle, sir, as possible.  That\'s the intention.  But, it\'s \nbeing made far too easy.  We are oiling the gates of life.  They \nought to be rusty.  We shall have them beginning to turn, soon, \nwith a smooth sound.  Whereas they ought to grate upon their \nhinges, sir.\'\n\nMr. Craggs seemed positively to grate upon his own hinges, as he \ndelivered this opinion; to which he communicated immense effect - \nbeing a cold, hard, dry, man, dressed in grey and white, like a \nflint; with small twinkles in his eyes, as if something struck \nsparks out of them.  The three natural kingdoms, indeed, had each a \nfanciful representative among this brotherhood of disputants; for \nSnitchey was like a magpie or raven (only not so sleek), and the \nDoctor had a streaked face like a winter-pippin, with here and \nthere a dimple to express the peckings of the birds, and a very \nlittle bit of pigtail behind that stood for the stalk.\n\nAs the active figure of a handsome young man, dressed for a \njourney, and followed by a porter bearing several packages and \nbaskets, entered the orchard at a brisk pace, and with an air of \ngaiety and hope that accorded well with the morning, these three \ndrew together, like the brothers of the sister Fates, or like the \nGraces most effectually disguised, or like the three weird prophets \non the heath, and greeted him.\n\n\'Happy returns, Alf!\' said the Doctor, lightly.\n\n\'A hundred happy returns of this auspicious day, Mr. Heathfield!\' \nsaid Snitchey, bowing low.\n\n\'Returns!\' Craggs murmured in a deep voice, all alone.\n\n\'Why, what a battery!\' exclaimed Alfred, stopping short, \'and one - \ntwo - three - all foreboders of no good, in the great sea before \nme.  I am glad you are not the first I have met this morning:  I \nshould have taken it for a bad omen.  But, Grace was the first - \nsweet, pleasant Grace - so I defy you all!\'\n\n\'If you please, Mister, I was the first you know,\' said Clemency \nNewcome.  \'She was walking out here, before sunrise, you remember.  \nI was in the house.\'\n\n\'That\'s true!  Clemency was the first,\' said Alfred.  \'So I defy \nyou with Clemency.\'\n\n\'Ha, ha, ha, - for Self and Craggs,\' said Snitchey.  \'What a \ndefiance!\'\n\n\'Not so bad a one as it appears, may be,\' said Alfred, shaking \nhands heartily with the Doctor, and also with Snitchey and Craggs, \nand then looking round.  \'Where are the - Good Heavens!\'\n\nWith a start, productive for the moment of a closer partnership \nbetween Jonathan Snitchey and Thomas Craggs than the subsisting \narticles of agreement in that wise contemplated, he hastily betook \nhimself to where the sisters stood together, and - however, I \nneedn\'t more particularly explain his manner of saluting Marion \nfirst, and Grace afterwards, than by hinting that Mr. Craggs may \npossibly have considered it \'too easy.\'\n\nPerhaps to change the subject, Dr. Jeddler made a hasty move \ntowards the breakfast, and they all sat down at table.  Grace \npresided; but so discreetly stationed herself, as to cut off her \nsister and Alfred from the rest of the company.  Snitchey and \nCraggs sat at opposite corners, with the blue bag between them for \nsafety; the Doctor took his usual position, opposite to Grace.  \nClemency hovered galvanically about the table, as waitress; and the \nmelancholy Britain, at another and a smaller board, acted as Grand \nCarver of a round of beef and a ham.\n\n\'Meat?\' said Britain, approaching Mr. Snitchey, with the carving \nknife and fork in his hands, and throwing the question at him like \na missile.\n\n\'Certainly,\' returned the lawyer.\n\n\'Do YOU want any?\' to Craggs.\n\n\'Lean and well done,\' replied that gentleman.\n\nHaving executed these orders, and moderately supplied the Doctor \n(he seemed to know that nobody else wanted anything to eat), he \nlingered as near the Firm as he decently could, watching with an \naustere eye their disposition of the viands, and but once relaxing \nthe severe expression of his face.  This was on the occasion of Mr. \nCraggs, whose teeth were not of the best, partially choking, when \nhe cried out with great animation, \'I thought he was gone!\'\n\n\'Now, Alfred,\' said the Doctor, \'for a word or two of business, \nwhile we are yet at breakfast.\'\n\n\'While we are yet at breakfast,\' said Snitchey and Craggs, who \nseemed to have no present idea of leaving off.\n\nAlthough Alfred had not been breakfasting, and seemed to have quite \nenough business on his hands as it was, he respectfully answered:\n\n\'If you please, sir.\'\n\n\'If anything could be serious,\' the Doctor began, \'in such a - \'\n\n\'Farce as this, sir,\' hinted Alfred.\n\n\'In such a farce as this,\' observed the Doctor, \'it might be this \nrecurrence, on the eve of separation, of a double birthday, which \nis connected with many associations pleasant to us four, and with \nthe recollection of a long and amicable intercourse.  That\'s not to \nthe purpose.\'\n\n\'Ah! yes, yes, Dr. Jeddler,\' said the young man.  \'It is to the \npurpose.  Much to the purpose, as my heart bears witness this \nmorning; and as yours does too, I know, if you would let it speak.  \nI leave your house to-day; I cease to be your ward to-day; we part \nwith tender relations stretching far behind us, that never can be \nexactly renewed, and with others dawning - yet before us,\' he \nlooked down at Marion beside him, \'fraught with such considerations \nas I must not trust myself to speak of now.  Come, come!\' he added, \nrallying his spirits and the Doctor at once, \'there\'s a serious \ngrain in this large foolish dust-heap, Doctor.  Let us allow to-\nday, that there is One.\'\n\n\'To-day!\' cried the Doctor.  \'Hear him!  Ha, ha, ha!  Of all days \nin the foolish year.  Why, on this day, the great battle was fought \non this ground.  On this ground where we now sit, where I saw my \ntwo girls dance this morning, where the fruit has just been \ngathered for our eating from these trees, the roots of which are \nstruck in Men, not earth, - so many lives were lost, that within my \nrecollection, generations afterwards, a churchyard full of bones, \nand dust of bones, and chips of cloven skulls, has been dug up from \nunderneath our feet here.  Yet not a hundred people in that battle \nknew for what they fought, or why; not a hundred of the \ninconsiderate rejoicers in the victory, why they rejoiced.  Not \nhalf a hundred people were the better for the gain or loss.  Not \nhalf-a-dozen men agree to this hour on the cause or merits; and \nnobody, in short, ever knew anything distinct about it, but the \nmourners of the slain.  Serious, too!\' said the Doctor, laughing.  \n\'Such a system!\'\n\n\'But, all this seems to me,\' said Alfred, \'to be very serious.\'\n\n\'Serious!\' cried the Doctor.  \'If you allowed such things to be \nserious, you must go mad, or die, or climb up to the top of a \nmountain, and turn hermit.\'\n\n\'Besides - so long ago,\' said Alfred.\n\n\'Long ago!\' returned the Doctor.  \'Do you know what the world has \nbeen doing, ever since?  Do you know what else it has been doing?  \nI don\'t!\'\n\n\'It has gone to law a little,\' observed Mr. Snitchey, stirring his \ntea.\n\n\'Although the way out has been always made too easy,\' said his \npartner.\n\n\'And you\'ll excuse my saying, Doctor,\' pursued Mr. Snitchey, \n\'having been already put a thousand times in possession of my \nopinion, in the course of our discussions, that, in its having gone \nto law, and in its legal system altogether, I do observe a serious \nside - now, really, a something tangible, and with a purpose and \nintention in it - \'\n\nClemency Newcome made an angular tumble against the table, \noccasioning a sounding clatter among the cups and saucers.\n\n\'Heyday! what\'s the matter there?\' exclaimed the Doctor.\n\n\'It\'s this evil-inclined blue bag,\' said Clemency, \'always tripping \nup somebody!\'\n\n\'With a purpose and intention in it, I was saying,\' resumed \nSnitchey, \'that commands respect.  Life a farce, Dr. Jeddler?  With \nlaw in it?\'\n\nThe Doctor laughed, and looked at Alfred.\n\n\'Granted, if you please, that war is foolish,\' said Snitchey.  \n\'There we agree.  For example.  Here\'s a smiling country,\' pointing \nit out with his fork, \'once overrun by soldiers - trespassers every \nman of \'em - and laid waste by fire and sword.  He, he, he!  The \nidea of any man exposing himself, voluntarily, to fire and sword!  \nStupid, wasteful, positively ridiculous; you laugh at your fellow-\ncreatures, you know, when you think of it!  But take this smiling \ncountry as it stands.  Think of the laws appertaining to real \nproperty; to the bequest and devise of real property; to the \nmortgage and redemption of real property; to leasehold, freehold, \nand copyhold estate; think,\' said Mr. Snitchey, with such great \nemotion that he actually smacked his lips, \'of the complicated laws \nrelating to title and proof of title, with all the contradictory \nprecedents and numerous acts of parliament connected with them; \nthink of the infinite number of ingenious and interminable chancery \nsuits, to which this pleasant prospect may give rise; and \nacknowledge, Dr. Jeddler, that there is a green spot in the scheme \nabout us!  I believe,\' said Mr. Snitchey, looking at his partner, \n\'that I speak for Self and Craggs?\'\n\nMr. Craggs having signified assent, Mr. Snitchey, somewhat \nfreshened by his recent eloquence, observed that he would take a \nlittle more beef and another cup of tea.\n\n\'I don\'t stand up for life in general,\' he added, rubbing his hands \nand chuckling, \'it\'s full of folly; full of something worse.  \nProfessions of trust, and confidence, and unselfishness, and all \nthat!  Bah, bah, bah!  We see what they\'re worth.  But, you mustn\'t \nlaugh at life; you\'ve got a game to play; a very serious game \nindeed!  Everybody\'s playing against you, you know, and you\'re \nplaying against them.  Oh! it\'s a very interesting thing.  There \nare deep moves upon the board.  You must only laugh, Dr. Jeddler, \nwhen you win - and then not much.  He, he, he!  And then not much,\' \nrepeated Snitchey, rolling his head and winking his eye, as if he \nwould have added, \'you may do this instead!\'\n\n\'Well, Alfred!\' cried the Doctor, \'what do you say now?\'\n\n\'I say, sir,\' replied Alfred, \'that the greatest favour you could \ndo me, and yourself too, I am inclined to think, would be to try \nsometimes to forget this battle-field and others like it in that \nbroader battle-field of Life, on which the sun looks every day.\'\n\n\'Really, I\'m afraid that wouldn\'t soften his opinions, Mr. Alfred,\' \nsaid Snitchey.  \'The combatants are very eager and very bitter in \nthat same battle of Life.  There\'s a great deal of cutting and \nslashing, and firing into people\'s heads from behind.  There is \nterrible treading down, and trampling on.  It is rather a bad \nbusiness.\'\n\n\'I believe, Mr. Snitchey,\' said Alfred, \'there are quiet victories \nand struggles, great sacrifices of self, and noble acts of heroism, \nin it - even in many of its apparent lightnesses and contradictions \n- not the less difficult to achieve, because they have no earthly \nchronicle or audience - done every day in nooks and corners, and in \nlittle households, and in men\'s and women\'s hearts - any one of \nwhich might reconcile the sternest man to such a world, and fill \nhim with belief and hope in it, though two-fourths of its people \nwere at war, and another fourth at law; and that\'s a bold word.\'\n\nBoth the sisters listened keenly.\n\n\'Well, well!\' said the Doctor, \'I am too old to be converted, even \nby my friend Snitchey here, or my good spinster sister, Martha \nJeddler; who had what she calls her domestic trials ages ago, and \nhas led a sympathising life with all sorts of people ever since; \nand who is so much of your opinion (only she\'s less reasonable and \nmore obstinate, being a woman), that we can\'t agree, and seldom \nmeet.  I was born upon this battle-field.  I began, as a boy, to \nhave my thoughts directed to the real history of a battle-field.  \nSixty years have gone over my head, and I have never seen the \nChristian world, including Heaven knows how many loving mothers and \ngood enough girls like mine here, anything but mad for a battle-\nfield.  The same contradictions prevail in everything.  One must \neither laugh or cry at such stupendous inconsistencies; and I \nprefer to laugh.\'\n\nBritain, who had been paying the profoundest and most melancholy \nattention to each speaker in his turn, seemed suddenly to decide in \nfavour of the same preference, if a deep sepulchral sound that \nescaped him might be construed into a demonstration of risibility.  \nHis face, however, was so perfectly unaffected by it, both before \nand afterwards, that although one or two of the breakfast party \nlooked round as being startled by a mysterious noise, nobody \nconnected the offender with it.\n\nExcept his partner in attendance, Clemency Newcome; who rousing him \nwith one of those favourite joints, her elbows, inquired, in a \nreproachful whisper, what he laughed at.\n\n\'Not you!\' said Britain.\n\n\'Who then?\'\n\n\'Humanity,\' said Britain.  \'That\'s the joke!\'\n\n\'What between master and them lawyers, he\'s getting more and more \naddle-headed every day!\' cried Clemency, giving him a lunge with \nthe other elbow, as a mental stimulant.  \'Do you know where you \nare?  Do you want to get warning?\'\n\n\'I don\'t know anything,\' said Britain, with a leaden eye and an \nimmovable visage.  \'I don\'t care for anything.  I don\'t make out \nanything.  I don\'t believe anything.  And I don\'t want anything.\'\n\nAlthough this forlorn summary of his general condition may have \nbeen overcharged in an access of despondency, Benjamin Britain - \nsometimes called Little Britain, to distinguish him from Great; as \nwe might say Young England, to express Old England with a decided \ndifference - had defined his real state more accurately than might \nbe supposed.  For, serving as a sort of man Miles to the Doctor\'s \nFriar Bacon, and listening day after day to innumerable orations \naddressed by the Doctor to various people, all tending to show that \nhis very existence was at best a mistake and an absurdity, this \nunfortunate servitor had fallen, by degrees, into such an abyss of \nconfused and contradictory suggestions from within and without, \nthat Truth at the bottom of her well, was on the level surface as \ncompared with Britain in the depths of his mystification.  The only \npoint he clearly comprehended, was, that the new element usually \nbrought into these discussions by Snitchey and Craggs, never served \nto make them clearer, and always seemed to give the Doctor a \nspecies of advantage and confirmation.  Therefore, he looked upon \nthe Firm as one of the proximate causes of his state of mind, and \nheld them in abhorrence accordingly.\n\n\'But, this is not our business, Alfred,\' said the Doctor.  \'Ceasing \nto be my ward (as you have said) to-day; and leaving us full to the \nbrim of such learning as the Grammar School down here was able to \ngive you, and your studies in London could add to that, and such \npractical knowledge as a dull old country Doctor like myself could \ngraft upon both; you are away, now, into the world.  The first term \nof probation appointed by your poor father, being over, away you go \nnow, your own master, to fulfil his second desire.  And long before \nyour three years\' tour among the foreign schools of medicine is \nfinished, you\'ll have forgotten us.  Lord, you\'ll forget us easily \nin six months!\'\n\n\'If I do - But you know better; why should I speak to you!\' said \nAlfred, laughing.\n\n\'I don\'t know anything of the sort,\' returned the Doctor.  \'What do \nyou say, Marion?\'\n\nMarion, trifling with her teacup, seemed to say - but she didn\'t \nsay it - that he was welcome to forget, if he could.  Grace pressed \nthe blooming face against her cheek, and smiled.\n\n\'I haven\'t been, I hope, a very unjust steward in the execution of \nmy trust,\' pursued the Doctor; \'but I am to be, at any rate, \nformally discharged, and released, and what not this morning; and \nhere are our good friends Snitchey and Craggs, with a bagful of \npapers, and accounts, and documents, for the transfer of the \nbalance of the trust fund to you (I wish it was a more difficult \none to dispose of, Alfred, but you must get to be a great man and \nmake it so), and other drolleries of that sort, which are to be \nsigned, sealed, and delivered.\'\n\n\'And duly witnessed as by law required,\' said Snitchey, pushing \naway his plate, and taking out the papers, which his partner \nproceeded to spread upon the table; \'and Self and Crags having been \nco-trustees with you, Doctor, in so far as the fund was concerned, \nwe shall want your two servants to attest the signatures - can you \nread, Mrs. Newcome?\'\n\n\'I an\'t married, Mister,\' said Clemency.\n\n\'Oh!  I beg your pardon.  I should think not,\' chuckled Snitchey, \ncasting his eyes over her extraordinary figure.  \'You CAN read?\'\n\n\'A little,\' answered Clemency.\n\n\'The marriage service, night and morning, eh?\' observed the lawyer, \njocosely.\n\n\'No,\' said Clemency.  \'Too hard.  I only reads a thimble.\'\n\n\'Read a thimble!\' echoed Snitchey.  \'What are you talking about, \nyoung woman?\'\n\nClemency nodded.  \'And a nutmeg-grater.\'\n\n\'Why, this is a lunatic! a subject for the Lord High Chancellor!\' \nsaid Snitchey, staring at her.\n\n- \'If possessed of any property,\' stipulated Craggs.\n\nGrace, however, interposing, explained that each of the articles in \nquestion bore an engraved motto, and so formed the pocket library \nof Clemency Newcome, who was not much given to the study of books.\n\n\'Oh, that\'s it, is it, Miss Grace!\' said Snitchey.\n\n\'Yes, yes.  Ha, ha, ha!  I thought our friend was an idiot.  She \nlooks uncommonly like it,\' he muttered, with a supercilious glance.  \n\'And what does the thimble say, Mrs. Newcome?\'\n\n\'I an\'t married, Mister,\' observed Clemency.\n\n\'Well, Newcome.  Will that do?\' said the lawyer.  \'What does the \nthimble say, Newcome?\'\n\nHow Clemency, before replying to this question, held one pocket \nopen, and looked down into its yawning depths for the thimble which \nwasn\'t there, - and how she then held an opposite pocket open, and \nseeming to descry it, like a pearl of great price, at the bottom, \ncleared away such intervening obstacles as a handkerchief, an end \nof wax candle, a flushed apple, an orange, a lucky penny, a cramp \nbone, a padlock, a pair of scissors in a sheath more expressively \ndescribable as promising young shears, a handful or so of loose \nbeads, several balls of cotton, a needle-case, a cabinet collection \nof curl-papers, and a biscuit, all of which articles she entrusted \nindividually and separately to Britain to hold, - is of no \nconsequence.\n\nNor how, in her determination to grasp this pocket by the throat \nand keep it prisoner (for it had a tendency to swing, and twist \nitself round the nearest corner), she assumed and calmly \nmaintained, an attitude apparently inconsistent with the human \nanatomy and the laws of gravity.  It is enough that at last she \ntriumphantly produced the thimble on her finger, and rattled the \nnutmeg-grater:  the literature of both those trinkets being \nobviously in course of wearing out and wasting away, through \nexcessive friction.\n\n\'That\'s the thimble, is it, young woman?\' said Mr. Snitchey, \ndiverting himself at her expense.  \'And what does the thimble say?\'\n\n\'It says,\' replied Clemency, reading slowly round as if it were a \ntower, \'For-get and For-give.\'\n\nSnitchey and Craggs laughed heartily.  \'So new!\' said Snitchey.  \n\'So easy!\' said Craggs.  \'Such a knowledge of human nature in it!\' \nsaid Snitchey.  \'So applicable to the affairs of life!\' said \nCraggs.\n\n\'And the nutmeg-grater?\' inquired the head of the Firm.\n\n\'The grater says,\' returned Clemency, \'Do as you - wold - be - done \nby.\'\n\n\'Do, or you\'ll be done brown, you mean,\' said Mr. Snitchey.\n\n\'I don\'t understand,\' retorted Clemency, shaking her head vaguely.  \n\'I an\'t no lawyer.\'\n\n\'I am afraid that if she was, Doctor,\' said Mr. Snitchey, turning \nto him suddenly, as if to anticipate any effect that might \notherwise be consequent on this retort, \'she\'d find it to be the \ngolden rule of half her clients.  They are serious enough in that - \nwhimsical as your world is - and lay the blame on us afterwards.  \nWe, in our profession, are little else than mirrors after all, Mr. \nAlfred; but, we are generally consulted by angry and quarrelsome \npeople who are not in their best looks, and it\'s rather hard to \nquarrel with us if we reflect unpleasant aspects.  I think,\' said \nMr. Snitchey, \'that I speak for Self and Craggs?\'\n\n\'Decidedly,\' said Craggs.\n\n\'And so, if Mr. Britain will oblige us with a mouthful of ink,\' \nsaid Mr. Snitchey, returning to the papers, \'we\'ll sign, seal, and \ndeliver as soon as possible, or the coach will be coming past \nbefore we know where we are.\'\n\nIf one might judge from his appearance, there was every probability \nof the coach coming past before Mr. Britain knew where HE was; for \nhe stood in a state of abstraction, mentally balancing the Doctor \nagainst the lawyers, and the lawyers against the Doctor, and their \nclients against both, and engaged in feeble attempts to make the \nthimble and nutmeg-grater (a new idea to him) square with anybody\'s \nsystem of philosophy; and, in short, bewildering himself as much as \never his great namesake has done with theories and schools.  But, \nClemency, who was his good Genius - though he had the meanest \npossible opinion of her understanding, by reason of her seldom \ntroubling herself with abstract speculations, and being always at \nhand to do the right thing at the right time - having produced the \nink in a twinkling, tendered him the further service of recalling \nhim to himself by the application of her elbows; with which gentle \nflappers she so jogged his memory, in a more literal construction \nof that phrase than usual, that he soon became quite fresh and \nbrisk.\n\nHow he laboured under an apprehension not uncommon to persons in \nhis degree, to whom the use of pen and ink is an event, that he \ncouldn\'t append his name to a document, not of his own writing, \nwithout committing himself in some shadowy manner, or somehow \nsigning away vague and enormous sums of money; and how he \napproached the deeds under protest, and by dint of the Doctor\'s \ncoercion, and insisted on pausing to look at them before writing \n(the cramped hand, to say nothing of the phraseology, being so much \nChinese to him), and also on turning them round to see whether \nthere was anything fraudulent underneath; and how, having signed \nhis name, he became desolate as one who had parted with his \nproperty and rights; I want the time to tell.  Also, how the blue \nbag containing his signature, afterwards had a mysterious interest \nfor him, and he couldn\'t leave it; also, how Clemency Newcome, in \nan ecstasy of laughter at the idea of her own importance and \ndignity, brooded over the whole table with her two elbows, like a \nspread eagle, and reposed her head upon her left arm as a \npreliminary to the formation of certain cabalistic characters, \nwhich required a deal of ink, and imaginary counterparts whereof \nshe executed at the same time with her tongue.  Also, how, having \nonce tasted ink, she became thirsty in that regard, as tame tigers \nare said to be after tasting another sort of fluid, and wanted to \nsign everything, and put her name in all kinds of places.  In \nbrief, the Doctor was discharged of his trust and all its \nresponsibilities; and Alfred, taking it on himself, was fairly \nstarted on the journey of life.\n\n\'Britain!\' said the Doctor.  \'Run to the gate, and watch for the \ncoach.  Time flies, Alfred.\'\n\n\'Yes, sir, yes,\' returned the young man, hurriedly.  \'Dear Grace! a \nmoment!  Marion - so young and beautiful, so winning and so much \nadmired, dear to my heart as nothing else in life is - remember!  I \nleave Marion to you!\'\n\n\'She has always been a sacred charge to me, Alfred.  She is doubly \nso, now.  I will be faithful to my trust, believe me.\'\n\n\'I do believe it, Grace.  I know it well.  Who could look upon your \nface, and hear your voice, and not know it!  Ah, Grace!  If I had \nyour well-governed heart, and tranquil mind, how bravely I would \nleave this place to-day!\'\n\n\'Would you?\' she answered with a quiet smile.\n\n\'And yet, Grace - Sister, seems the natural word.\'\n\n\'Use it!\' she said quickly.  \'I am glad to hear it.  Call me \nnothing else.\'\n\n\'And yet, sister, then,\' said Alfred, \'Marion and I had better have \nyour true and steadfast qualities serving us here, and making us \nboth happier and better.  I wouldn\'t carry them away, to sustain \nmyself, if I could!\'\n\n\'Coach upon the hill-top!\' exclaimed Britain.\n\n\'Time flies, Alfred,\' said the Doctor.\n\nMarion had stood apart, with her eyes fixed upon the ground; but, \nthis warning being given, her young lover brought her tenderly to \nwhere her sister stood, and gave her into her embrace.\n\n\'I have been telling Grace, dear Marion,\' he said, \'that you are \nher charge; my precious trust at parting.  And when I come back and \nreclaim you, dearest, and the bright prospect of our married life \nlies stretched before us, it shall be one of our chief pleasures to \nconsult how we can make Grace happy; how we can anticipate her \nwishes; how we can show our gratitude and love to her; how we can \nreturn her something of the debt she will have heaped upon us.\'\n\nThe younger sister had one hand in his; the other rested on her \nsister\'s neck.  She looked into that sister\'s eyes, so calm, \nserene, and cheerful, with a gaze in which affection, admiration, \nsorrow, wonder, almost veneration, were blended.  She looked into \nthat sister\'s face, as if it were the face of some bright angel.  \nCalm, serene, and cheerful, the face looked back on her and on her \nlover.\n\n\'And when the time comes, as it must one day,\' said Alfred, - \'I \nwonder it has never come yet, but Grace knows best, for Grace is \nalways right - when SHE will want a friend to open her whole heart \nto, and to be to her something of what she has been to us - then, \nMarion, how faithful we will prove, and what delight to us to know \nthat she, our dear good sister, loves and is loved again, as we \nwould have her!\'\n\nStill the younger sister looked into her eyes, and turned not - \neven towards him.  And still those honest eyes looked back, so \ncalm, serene, and cheerful, on herself and on her lover.\n\n\'And when all that is past, and we are old, and living (as we \nmust!) together - close together - talking often of old times,\' \nsaid Alfred - \'these shall be our favourite times among them - this \nday most of all; and, telling each other what we thought and felt, \nand hoped and feared at parting; and how we couldn\'t bear to say \ngood bye - \'\n\n\'Coach coming through the wood!\' cried Britain.\n\n\'Yes!  I am ready - and how we met again, so happily in spite of \nall; we\'ll make this day the happiest in all the year, and keep it \nas a treble birth-day.  Shall we, dear?\'\n\n\'Yes!\' interposed the elder sister, eagerly, and with a radiant \nsmile.  \'Yes!  Alfred, don\'t linger.  There\'s no time.  Say good \nbye to Marion.  And Heaven be with you!\'\n\nHe pressed the younger sister to his heart.  Released from his \nembrace, she again clung to her sister; and her eyes, with the same \nblended look, again sought those so calm, serene, and cheerful.\n\n\'Farewell, my boy!\' said the Doctor.  \'To talk about any serious \ncorrespondence or serious affections, and engagements and so forth, \nin such a - ha ha ha! - you know what I mean - why that, of course, \nwould be sheer nonsense.  All I can say is, that if you and Marion \nshould continue in the same foolish minds, I shall not object to \nhave you for a son-in-law one of these days.\'\n\n\'Over the bridge!\' cried Britain.\n\n\'Let it come!\' said Alfred, wringing the Doctor\'s hand stoutly.  \n\'Think of me sometimes, my old friend and guardian, as seriously as \nyou can!  Adieu, Mr. Snitchey!  Farewell, Mr. Craggs!\'\n\n\'Coming down the road!\' cried Britain.\n\n\'A kiss of Clemency Newcome for long acquaintance\' sake!  Shake \nhands, Britain!  Marion, dearest heart, good bye!  Sister Grace! \nremember!\'\n\nThe quiet household figure, and the face so beautiful in its \nserenity, were turned towards him in reply; but Marion\'s look and \nattitude remained unchanged.\n\nThe coach was at the gate.  There was a bustle with the luggage.  \nThe coach drove away.  Marion never moved.\n\n\'He waves his hat to you, my love,\' said Grace.  \'Your chosen \nhusband, darling.  Look!\'\n\nThe younger sister raised her head, and, for a moment, turned it.  \nThen, turning back again, and fully meeting, for the first time, \nthose calm eyes, fell sobbing on her neck.\n\n\'Oh, Grace.  God bless you!  But I cannot bear to see it, Grace!  \nIt breaks my heart.\'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II - Part The Second\n\n\n\nSNITCHEY AND CRAGGS had a snug little office on the old Battle \nGround, where they drove a snug little business, and fought a great \nmany small pitched battles for a great many contending parties.  \nThough it could hardly be said of these conflicts that they were \nrunning fights - for in truth they generally proceeded at a snail\'s \npace - the part the Firm had in them came so far within the general \ndenomination, that now they took a shot at this Plaintiff, and now \naimed a chop at that Defendant, now made a heavy charge at an \nestate in Chancery, and now had some light skirmishing among an \nirregular body of small debtors, just as the occasion served, and \nthe enemy happened to present himself.  The Gazette was an \nimportant and profitable feature in some of their fields, as in \nfields of greater renown; and in most of the Actions wherein they \nshowed their generalship, it was afterwards observed by the \ncombatants that they had had great difficulty in making each other \nout, or in knowing with any degree of distinctness what they were \nabout, in consequence of the vast amount of smoke by which they \nwere surrounded.\n\nThe offices of Messrs. Snitchey and Craggs stood convenient, with \nan open door down two smooth steps, in the market-place; so that \nany angry farmer inclining towards hot water, might tumble into it \nat once.  Their special council-chamber and hall of conference was \nan old back-room up-stairs, with a low dark ceiling, which seemed \nto be knitting its brows gloomily in the consideration of tangled \npoints of law.  It was furnished with some high-backed leathern \nchairs, garnished with great goggle-eyed brass nails, of which, \nevery here and there, two or three had fallen out - or had been \npicked out, perhaps, by the wandering thumbs and forefingers of \nbewildered clients.  There was a framed print of a great judge in \nit, every curl in whose dreadful wig had made a man\'s hair stand on \nend.  Bales of papers filled the dusty closets, shelves, and \ntables; and round the wainscot there were tiers of boxes, padlocked \nand fireproof, with people\'s names painted outside, which anxious \nvisitors felt themselves, by a cruel enchantment, obliged to spell \nbackwards and forwards, and to make anagrams of, while they sat, \nseeming to listen to Snitchey and Craggs, without comprehending one \nword of what they said.\n\nSnitchey and Craggs had each, in private life as in professional \nexistence, a partner of his own.  Snitchey and Craggs were the best \nfriends in the world, and had a real confidence in one another; but \nMrs. Snitchey, by a dispensation not uncommon in the affairs of \nlife, was on principle suspicious of Mr. Craggs; and Mrs. Craggs \nwas on principle suspicious of Mr. Snitchey.  \'Your Snitcheys \nindeed,\' the latter lady would observe, sometimes, to Mr. Craggs; \nusing that imaginative plural as if in disparagement of an \nobjectionable pair of pantaloons, or other articles not possessed \nof a singular number; \'I don\'t see what you want with your \nSnitcheys, for my part.  You trust a great deal too much to your \nSnitcheys, I think, and I hope you may never find my words come \ntrue.\'  While Mrs. Snitchey would observe to Mr. Snitchey, of \nCraggs, \'that if ever he was led away by man he was led away by \nthat man, and that if ever she read a double purpose in a mortal \neye, she read that purpose in Craggs\'s eye.\'  Notwithstanding this, \nhowever, they were all very good friends in general:  and Mrs. \nSnitchey and Mrs. Craggs maintained a close bond of alliance \nagainst \'the office,\' which they both considered the Blue chamber, \nand common enemy, full of dangerous (because unknown) machinations.\n\nIn this office, nevertheless, Snitchey and Craggs made honey for \ntheir several hives.  Here, sometimes, they would linger, of a fine \nevening, at the window of their council-chamber overlooking the old \nbattle-ground, and wonder (but that was generally at assize time, \nwhen much business had made them sentimental) at the folly of \nmankind, who couldn\'t always be at peace with one another and go to \nlaw comfortably.  Here, days, and weeks, and months, and years, \npassed over them:  their calendar, the gradually diminishing number \nof brass nails in the leathern chairs, and the increasing bulk of \npapers on the tables.  Here, nearly three years\' flight had thinned \nthe one and swelled the other, since the breakfast in the orchard; \nwhen they sat together in consultation at night.\n\nNot alone; but, with a man of about thirty, or that time of life, \nnegligently dressed, and somewhat haggard in the face, but well-\nmade, well-attired, and well-looking, who sat in the armchair of \nstate, with one hand in his breast, and the other in his \ndishevelled hair, pondering moodily.  Messrs. Snitchey and Craggs \nsat opposite each other at a neighbouring desk.  One of the \nfireproof boxes, unpadlocked and opened, was upon it; a part of its \ncontents lay strewn upon the table, and the rest was then in course \nof passing through the hands of Mr. Snitchey; who brought it to the \ncandle, document by document; looked at every paper singly, as he \nproduced it; shook his head, and handed it to Mr. Craggs; who \nlooked it over also, shook his head, and laid it down.  Sometimes, \nthey would stop, and shaking their heads in concert, look towards \nthe abstracted client.  And the name on the box being Michael \nWarden, Esquire, we may conclude from these premises that the name \nand the box were both his, and that the affairs of Michael Warden, \nEsquire, were in a bad way.\n\n\'That\'s all,\' said Mr. Snitchey, turning up the last paper.  \n\'Really there\'s no other resource.  No other resource.\'\n\n\'All lost, spent, wasted, pawned, borrowed, and sold, eh?\' said the \nclient, looking up.\n\n\'All,\' returned Mr. Snitchey.\n\n\'Nothing else to be done, you say?\'\n\n\'Nothing at all.\'\n\nThe client bit his nails, and pondered again.\n\n\'And I am not even personally safe in England?  You hold to that, \ndo you?\'\n\n\'In no part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,\' \nreplied Mr. Snitchey.\n\n\'A mere prodigal son with no father to go back to, no swine to \nkeep, and no husks to share with them?  Eh?\' pursued the client, \nrocking one leg over the other, and searching the ground with his \neyes.\n\nMr. Snitchey coughed, as if to deprecate the being supposed to \nparticipate in any figurative illustration of a legal position.  \nMr. Craggs, as if to express that it was a partnership view of the \nsubject, also coughed.\n\n\'Ruined at thirty!\' said the client.  \'Humph!\'\n\n\'Not ruined, Mr. Warden,\' returned Snitchey.  \'Not so bad as that.  \nYou have done a good deal towards it, I must say, but you are not \nruined.  A little nursing - \'\n\n\'A little Devil,\' said the client.\n\n\'Mr. Craggs,\' said Snitchey, \'will you oblige me with a pinch of \nsnuff?  Thank you, sir.\'\n\nAs the imperturbable lawyer applied it to his nose with great \napparent relish and a perfect absorption of his attention in the \nproceeding, the client gradually broke into a smile, and, looking \nup, said:\n\n\'You talk of nursing.  How long nursing?\'\n\n\'How long nursing?\' repeated Snitchey, dusting the snuff from his \nfingers, and making a slow calculation in his mind.  \'For your \ninvolved estate, sir?  In good hands? S. and C.\'s, say?  Six or \nseven years.\'\n\n\'To starve for six or seven years!\' said the client with a fretful \nlaugh, and an impatient change of his position.\n\n\'To starve for six or seven years, Mr. Warden,\' said Snitchey, \n\'would be very uncommon indeed.  You might get another estate by \nshowing yourself, the while.  But, we don\'t think you could do it - \nspeaking for Self and Craggs - and consequently don\'t advise it.\'\n\n\'What DO you advise?\'\n\n\'Nursing, I say,\' repeated Snitchey.  \'Some few years of nursing by \nSelf and Craggs would bring it round.  But to enable us to make \nterms, and hold terms, and you to keep terms, you must go away; you \nmust live abroad.  As to starvation, we could ensure you some \nhundreds a-year to starve upon, even in the beginning - I dare say, \nMr. Warden.\'\n\n\'Hundreds,\' said the client.  \'And I have spent thousands!\'\n\n\'That,\' retorted Mr. Snitchey, putting the papers slowly back into \nthe cast-iron box, \'there is no doubt about.  No doubt about,\' he \nrepeated to himself, as he thoughtfully pursued his occupation.\n\nThe lawyer very likely knew HIS man; at any rate his dry, shrewd, \nwhimsical manner, had a favourable influence on the client\'s moody \nstate, and disposed him to be more free and unreserved.  Or, \nperhaps the client knew HIS man, and had elicited such \nencouragement as he had received, to render some purpose he was \nabout to disclose the more defensible in appearance.  Gradually \nraising his head, he sat looking at his immovable adviser with a \nsmile, which presently broke into a laugh.\n\n\'After all,\' he said, \'my iron-headed friend - \'\n\nMr. Snitchey pointed out his partner.  \'Self and - excuse me - \nCraggs.\'\n\n\'I beg Mr. Craggs\'s pardon,\' said the client.  \'After all, my iron-\nheaded friends,\' he leaned forward in his chair, and dropped his \nvoice a little, \'you don\'t know half my ruin yet.\'\n\nMr. Snitchey stopped and stared at him.  Mr. Craggs also stared.\n\n\'I am not only deep in debt,\' said the client, \'but I am deep in - \n\'\n\n\'Not in love!\' cried Snitchey.\n\n\'Yes!\' said the client, falling back in his chair, and surveying \nthe Firm with his hands in his pockets.  \'Deep in love.\'\n\n\'And not with an heiress, sir?\' said Snitchey.\n\n\'Not with an heiress.\'\n\n\'Nor a rich lady?\'\n\n\'Nor a rich lady that I know of - except in beauty and merit.\'\n\n\'A single lady, I trust?\' said Mr. Snitchey, with great expression.\n\n\'Certainly.\'\n\n\'It\'s not one of Dr. Jeddler\'s daughters?\' said Snitchey, suddenly \nsquaring his elbows on his knees, and advancing his face at least a \nyard.\n\n\'Yes!\' returned the client.\n\n\'Not his younger daughter?\' said Snitchey.\n\n\'Yes!\' returned the client.\n\n\'Mr. Craggs,\' said Snitchey, much relieved, \'will you oblige me \nwith another pinch of snuff?  Thank you!  I am happy to say it \ndon\'t signify, Mr. Warden; she\'s engaged, sir, she\'s bespoke.  My \npartner can corroborate me.  We know the fact.\'\n\n\'We know the fact,\' repeated Craggs.\n\n\'Why, so do I perhaps,\' returned the client quietly.  \'What of \nthat!  Are you men of the world, and did you never hear of a woman \nchanging her mind?\'\n\n\'There certainly have been actions for breach,\' said Mr. Snitchey, \n\'brought against both spinsters and widows, but, in the majority of \ncases - \'\n\n\'Cases!\' interposed the client, impatiently.  \'Don\'t talk to me of \ncases.  The general precedent is in a much larger volume than any \nof your law books.  Besides, do you think I have lived six weeks in \nthe Doctor\'s house for nothing?\'\n\n\'I think, sir,\' observed Mr. Snitchey, gravely addressing himself \nto his partner, \'that of all the scrapes Mr. Warden\'s horses have \nbrought him into at one time and another - and they have been \npretty numerous, and pretty expensive, as none know better than \nhimself, and you, and I - the worst scrape may turn out to be, if \nhe talks in this way, this having ever been left by one of them at \nthe Doctor\'s garden wall, with three broken ribs, a snapped collar-\nbone, and the Lord knows how many bruises.  We didn\'t think so much \nof it, at the time when we knew he was going on well under the \nDoctor\'s hands and roof; but it looks bad now, sir.  Bad?  It looks \nvery bad.  Doctor Jeddler too - our client, Mr. Craggs.\'\n\n\'Mr. Alfred Heathfield too - a sort of client, Mr. Snitchey,\' said \nCraggs.\n\n\'Mr. Michael Warden too, a kind of client,\' said the careless \nvisitor, \'and no bad one either:  having played the fool for ten or \ntwelve years.  However, Mr. Michael Warden has sown his wild oats \nnow - there\'s their crop, in that box; and he means to repent and \nbe wise.  And in proof of it, Mr. Michael Warden means, if he can, \nto marry Marion, the Doctor\'s lovely daughter, and to carry her \naway with him.\'\n\n\'Really, Mr. Craggs,\' Snitchey began.\n\n\'Really, Mr. Snitchey, and Mr. Craggs, partners both,\' said the \nclient, interrupting him; \'you know your duty to your clients, and \nyou know well enough, I am sure, that it is no part of it to \ninterfere in a mere love affair, which I am obliged to confide to \nyou.  I am not going to carry the young lady off, without her own \nconsent.  There\'s nothing illegal in it.  I never was Mr. \nHeathfield\'s bosom friend.  I violate no confidence of his.  I love \nwhere he loves, and I mean to win where he would win, if I can.\'\n\n\'He can\'t, Mr. Craggs,\' said Snitchey, evidently anxious and \ndiscomfited.  \'He can\'t do it, sir.  She dotes on Mr. Alfred.\'\n\n\'Does she?\' returned the client.\n\n\'Mr. Craggs, she dotes on him, sir,\' persisted Snitchey.\n\n\'I didn\'t live six weeks, some few months ago, in the Doctor\'s \nhouse for nothing; and I doubted that soon,\' observed the client.  \n\'She would have doted on him, if her sister could have brought it \nabout; but I watched them.  Marion avoided his name, avoided the \nsubject:  shrunk from the least allusion to it, with evident \ndistress.\'\n\n\'Why should she, Mr. Craggs, you know?  Why should she, sir?\' \ninquired Snitchey.\n\n\'I don\'t know why she should, though there are many likely \nreasons,\' said the client, smiling at the attention and perplexity \nexpressed in Mr. Snitchey\'s shining eye, and at his cautious way of \ncarrying on the conversation, and making himself informed upon the \nsubject; \'but I know she does.  She was very young when she made \nthe engagement - if it may be called one, I am not even sure of \nthat - and has repented of it, perhaps.  Perhaps - it seems a \nfoppish thing to say, but upon my soul I don\'t mean it in that \nlight - she may have fallen in love with me, as I have fallen in \nlove with her.\'\n\n\'He, he!  Mr. Alfred, her old playfellow too, you remember, Mr. \nCraggs,\' said Snitchey, with a disconcerted laugh; \'knew her almost \nfrom a baby!\'\n\n\'Which makes it the more probable that she may be tired of his \nidea,\' calmly pursued the client, \'and not indisposed to exchange \nit for the newer one of another lover, who presents himself (or is \npresented by his horse) under romantic circumstances; has the not \nunfavourable reputation - with a country girl - of having lived \nthoughtlessly and gaily, without doing much harm to anybody; and \nwho, for his youth and figure, and so forth - this may seem foppish \nagain, but upon my soul I don\'t mean it in that light - might \nperhaps pass muster in a crowd with Mr. Alfred himself.\'\n\nThere was no gainsaying the last clause, certainly; and Mr. \nSnitchey, glancing at him, thought so.  There was something \nnaturally graceful and pleasant in the very carelessness of his \nair.  It seemed to suggest, of his comely face and well-knit \nfigure, that they might be greatly better if he chose:  and that, \nonce roused and made earnest (but he never had been earnest yet), \nhe could be full of fire and purpose.  \'A dangerous sort of \nlibertine,\' thought the shrewd lawyer, \'to seem to catch the spark \nhe wants, from a young lady\'s eyes.\'\n\n\'Now, observe, Snitchey,\' he continued, rising and taking him by \nthe button, \'and Craggs,\' taking him by the button also, and \nplacing one partner on either side of him, so that neither might \nevade him.  \'I don\'t ask you for any advice.  You are right to keep \nquite aloof from all parties in such a matter, which is not one in \nwhich grave men like you could interfere, on any side.  I am \nbriefly going to review in half-a-dozen words, my position and \nintention, and then I shall leave it to you to do the best for me, \nin money matters, that you can:  seeing, that, if I run away with \nthe Doctor\'s beautiful daughter (as I hope to do, and to become \nanother man under her bright influence), it will be, for the \nmoment, more chargeable than running away alone.  But I shall soon \nmake all that up in an altered life.\'\n\n\'I think it will be better not to hear this, Mr. Craggs?\' said \nSnitchey, looking at him across the client.\n\n\'I think not,\' said Craggs. - Both listened attentively.\n\n\'Well!  You needn\'t hear it,\' replied their client.  \'I\'ll mention \nit, however.  I don\'t mean to ask the Doctor\'s consent, because he \nwouldn\'t give it me.  But I mean to do the Doctor no wrong or harm, \nbecause (besides there being nothing serious in such trifles, as he \nsays) I hope to rescue his child, my Marion, from what I see - I \nKNOW - she dreads, and contemplates with misery:  that is, the \nreturn of this old lover.  If anything in the world is true, it is \ntrue that she dreads his return.  Nobody is injured so far.  I am \nso harried and worried here just now, that I lead the life of a \nflying-fish.  I skulk about in the dark, I am shut out of my own \nhouse, and warned off my own grounds; but, that house, and those \ngrounds, and many an acre besides, will come back to me one day, as \nyou know and say; and Marion will probably be richer - on your \nshowing, who are never sanguine - ten years hence as my wife, than \nas the wife of Alfred Heathfield, whose return she dreads (remember \nthat), and in whom or in any man, my passion is not surpassed.  Who \nis injured yet?  It is a fair case throughout.  My right is as good \nas his, if she decide in my favour; and I will try my right by her \nalone.  You will like to know no more after this, and I will tell \nyou no more.  Now you know my purpose, and wants.  When must I \nleave here?\'\n\n\'In a week,\' said Snitchey.  \'Mr. Craggs?\'\n\n\'In something less, I should say,\' responded Craggs.\n\n\'In a month,\' said the client, after attentively watching the two \nfaces.  \'This day month.  To-day is Thursday.  Succeed or fail, on \nthis day month I go.\'\n\n\'It\'s too long a delay,\' said Snitchey; \'much too long.  But let it \nbe so.  I thought he\'d have stipulated for three,\' he murmured to \nhimself.  \'Are you going?  Good night, sir!\'\n\n\'Good night!\' returned the client, shaking hands with the Firm.\n\n\'You\'ll live to see me making a good use of riches yet.  Henceforth \nthe star of my destiny is, Marion!\'\n\n\'Take care of the stairs, sir,\' replied Snitchey; \'for she don\'t \nshine there.  Good night!\'\n\n\'Good night!\'\n\nSo they both stood at the stair-head with a pair of office-candles, \nwatching him down.  When he had gone away, they stood looking at \neach other.\n\n\'What do you think of all this, Mr. Craggs?\' said Snitchey.\n\nMr. Craggs shook his head.\n\n\'It was our opinion, on the day when that release was executed, \nthat there was something curious in the parting of that pair; I \nrecollect,\' said Snitchey.\n\n\'It was,\' said Mr. Craggs.\n\n\'Perhaps he deceives himself altogether,\' pursued Mr. Snitchey, \nlocking up the fireproof box, and putting it away; \'or, if he \ndon\'t, a little bit of fickleness and perfidy is not a miracle, Mr. \nCraggs.  And yet I thought that pretty face was very true.  I \nthought,\' said Mr. Snitchey, putting on his great-coat (for the \nweather was very cold), drawing on his gloves, and snuffing out one \ncandle, \'that I had even seen her character becoming stronger and \nmore resolved of late.  More like her sister\'s.\'\n\n\'Mrs. Craggs was of the same opinion,\' returned Craggs.\n\n\'I\'d really give a trifle to-night,\' observed Mr. Snitchey, who was \na good-natured man, \'if I could believe that Mr. Warden was \nreckoning without his host; but, light-headed, capricious, and \nunballasted as he is, he knows something of the world and its \npeople (he ought to, for he has bought what he does know, dear \nenough); and I can\'t quite think that.  We had better not \ninterfere:  we can do nothing, Mr. Craggs, but keep quiet.\'\n\n\'Nothing,\' returned Craggs.\n\n\'Our friend the Doctor makes light of such things,\' said Mr. \nSnitchey, shaking his head.  \'I hope he mayn\'t stand in need of his \nphilosophy.  Our friend Alfred talks of the battle of life,\' he \nshook his head again, \'I hope he mayn\'t be cut down early in the \nday.  Have you got your hat, Mr. Craggs?  I am going to put the \nother candle out.\'  Mr. Craggs replying in the affirmative, Mr. \nSnitchey suited the action to the word, and they groped their way \nout of the council-chamber, now dark as the subject, or the law in \ngeneral.\n\n\nMy story passes to a quiet little study, where, on that same night, \nthe sisters and the hale old Doctor sat by a cheerful fireside.  \nGrace was working at her needle.  Marion read aloud from a book \nbefore her.  The Doctor, in his dressing-gown and slippers, with \nhis feet spread out upon the warm rug, leaned back in his easy-\nchair, and listened to the book, and looked upon his daughters.\n\nThey were very beautiful to look upon.  Two better faces for a \nfireside, never made a fireside bright and sacred.  Something of \nthe difference between them had been softened down in three years\' \ntime; and enthroned upon the clear brow of the younger sister, \nlooking through her eyes, and thrilling in her voice, was the same \nearnest nature that her own motherless youth had ripened in the \nelder sister long ago.  But she still appeared at once the lovelier \nand weaker of the two; still seemed to rest her head upon her \nsister\'s breast, and put her trust in her, and look into her eyes \nfor counsel and reliance.  Those loving eyes, so calm, serene, and \ncheerful, as of old.\n\n\'\"And being in her own home,\"\' read Marion, from the book; \'\"her \nhome made exquisitely dear by these remembrances, she now began to \nknow that the great trial of her heart must soon come on, and could \nnot be delayed.  O Home, our comforter and friend when others fall \naway, to part with whom, at any step between the cradle and the \ngrave\"\'-\n\n\'Marion, my love!\' said Grace.\n\n\'Why, Puss!\' exclaimed her father, \'what\'s the matter?\'\n\nShe put her hand upon the hand her sister stretched towards her, \nand read on; her voice still faltering and trembling, though she \nmade an effort to command it when thus interrupted.\n\n\'\"To part with whom, at any step between the cradle and the grave, \nis always sorrowful.  O Home, so true to us, so often slighted in \nreturn, be lenient to them that turn away from thee, and do not \nhaunt their erring footsteps too reproachfully!  Let no kind looks, \nno well-remembered smiles, be seen upon thy phantom face.  Let no \nray of affection, welcome, gentleness, forbearance, cordiality, \nshine from thy white head.  Let no old loving word, or tone, rise \nup in judgment against thy deserter; but if thou canst look harshly \nand severely, do, in mercy to the Penitent!\"\'\n\n\'Dear Marion, read no more to-night,\' said Grace for she was \nweeping.\n\n\'I cannot,\' she replied, and closed the book.  \'The words seem all \non fire!\'\n\nThe Doctor was amused at this; and laughed as he patted her on the \nhead.\n\n\'What! overcome by a story-book!\' said Doctor Jeddler.  \'Print and \npaper!  Well, well, it\'s all one.  It\'s as rational to make a \nserious matter of print and paper as of anything else.  But, dry \nyour eyes, love, dry your eyes.  I dare say the heroine has got \nhome again long ago, and made it up all round - and if she hasn\'t, \na real home is only four walls; and a fictitious one, mere rags and \nink.  What\'s the matter now?\'\n\n\'It\'s only me, Mister,\' said Clemency, putting in her head at the \ndoor.\n\n\'And what\'s the matter with YOU?\' said the Doctor.\n\n\'Oh, bless you, nothing an\'t the matter with me,\' returned Clemency \n- and truly too, to judge from her well-soaped face, in which there \ngleamed as usual the very soul of good-humour, which, ungainly as \nshe was, made her quite engaging.  Abrasions on the elbows are not \ngenerally understood, it is true, to range within that class of \npersonal charms called beauty-spots.  But, it is better, going \nthrough the world, to have the arms chafed in that narrow passage, \nthan the temper:  and Clemency\'s was sound and whole as any \nbeauty\'s in the land.\n\n\'Nothing an\'t the matter with me,\' said Clemency, entering, \'but - \ncome a little closer, Mister.\'\n\nThe Doctor, in some astonishment, complied with this invitation.\n\n\'You said I wasn\'t to give you one before them, you know,\' said \nClemency.\n\nA novice in the family might have supposed, from her extraordinary \nogling as she said it, as well as from a singular rapture or \necstasy which pervaded her elbows, as if she were embracing \nherself, that \'one,\' in its most favourable interpretation, meant a \nchaste salute.  Indeed the Doctor himself seemed alarmed, for the \nmoment; but quickly regained his composure, as Clemency, having had \nrecourse to both her pockets - beginning with the right one, going \naway to the wrong one, and afterwards coming back to the right one \nagain - produced a letter from the Post-office.\n\n\'Britain was riding by on a errand,\' she chuckled, handing it to \nthe Doctor, \'and see the mail come in, and waited for it.  There\'s \nA. H. in the corner.  Mr. Alfred\'s on his journey home, I bet.  We \nshall have a wedding in the house - there was two spoons in my \nsaucer this morning.  Oh Luck, how slow he opens it!\'\n\nAll this she delivered, by way of soliloquy, gradually rising \nhigher and higher on tiptoe, in her impatience to hear the news, \nand making a corkscrew of her apron, and a bottle of her mouth.  At \nlast, arriving at a climax of suspense, and seeing the Doctor still \nengaged in the perusal of the letter, she came down flat upon the \nsoles of her feet again, and cast her apron, as a veil, over her \nhead, in a mute despair, and inability to bear it any longer.\n\n\'Here!  Girls!\' cried the Doctor.  \'I can\'t help it:  I never could \nkeep a secret in my life.  There are not many secrets, indeed, \nworth being kept in such a - well! never mind that.  Alfred\'s \ncoming home, my dears, directly.\'\n\n\'Directly!\' exclaimed Marion.\n\n\'What!  The story-book is soon forgotten!\' said the Doctor, \npinching her cheek.  \'I thought the news would dry those tears.  \nYes.  \"Let it be a surprise,\" he says, here.  But I can\'t let it be \na surprise.  He must have a welcome.\'\n\n\'Directly!\' repeated Marion.\n\n\'Why, perhaps not what your impatience calls \"directly,\"\' returned \nthe doctor; \'but pretty soon too.  Let us see.  Let us see.  To-day \nis Thursday, is it not?  Then he promises to be here, this day \nmonth.\'\n\n\'This day month!\' repeated Marion, softly.\n\n\'A gay day and a holiday for us,\' said the cheerful voice of her \nsister Grace, kissing her in congratulation.  \'Long looked forward \nto, dearest, and come at last.\'\n\nShe answered with a smile; a mournful smile, but full of sisterly \naffection.  As she looked in her sister\'s face, and listened to the \nquiet music of her voice, picturing the happiness of this return, \nher own face glowed with hope and joy.\n\nAnd with a something else; a something shining more and more \nthrough all the rest of its expression; for which I have no name.  \nIt was not exultation, triumph, proud enthusiasm.  They are not so \ncalmly shown.  It was not love and gratitude alone, though love and \ngratitude were part of it.  It emanated from no sordid thought, for \nsordid thoughts do not light up the brow, and hover on the lips, \nand move the spirit like a fluttered light, until the sympathetic \nfigure trembles.\n\nDr. Jeddler, in spite of his system of philosophy - which he was \ncontinually contradicting and denying in practice, but more famous \nphilosophers have done that - could not help having as much \ninterest in the return of his old ward and pupil as if it had been \na serious event.  So he sat himself down in his easy-chair again, \nstretched out his slippered feet once more upon the rug, read the \nletter over and over a great many times, and talked it over more \ntimes still.\n\n\'Ah!  The day was,\' said the Doctor, looking at the fire, \'when you \nand he, Grace, used to trot about arm-in-arm, in his holiday time, \nlike a couple of walking dolls.  You remember?\'\n\n\'I remember,\' she answered, with her pleasant laugh, and plying her \nneedle busily.\n\n\'This day month, indeed!\' mused the Doctor.  \'That hardly seems a \ntwelve month ago.  And where was my little Marion then!\'\n\n\'Never far from her sister,\' said Marion, cheerily, \'however \nlittle.  Grace was everything to me, even when she was a young \nchild herself.\'\n\n\'True, Puss, true,\' returned the Doctor.  \'She was a staid little \nwoman, was Grace, and a wise housekeeper, and a busy, quiet, \npleasant body; bearing with our humours and anticipating our \nwishes, and always ready to forget her own, even in those times.  I \nnever knew you positive or obstinate, Grace, my darling, even then, \non any subject but one.\'\n\n\'I am afraid I have changed sadly for the worse, since,\' laughed \nGrace, still busy at her work.  \'What was that one, father?\'\n\n\'Alfred, of course,\' said the Doctor.  \'Nothing would serve you but \nyou must be called Alfred\'s wife; so we called you Alfred\'s wife; \nand you liked it better, I believe (odd as it seems now), than \nbeing called a Duchess, if we could have made you one.\'\n\n\'Indeed?\' said Grace, placidly.\n\n\'Why, don\'t you remember?\' inquired the Doctor.\n\n\'I think I remember something of it,\' she returned, \'but not much.  \nIt\'s so long ago.\'  And as she sat at work, she hummed the burden \nof an old song, which the Doctor liked.\n\n\'Alfred will find a real wife soon,\' she said, breaking off; \'and \nthat will be a happy time indeed for all of us.  My three years\' \ntrust is nearly at an end, Marion.  It has been a very easy one.  I \nshall tell Alfred, when I give you back to him, that you have loved \nhim dearly all the time, and that he has never once needed my good \nservices.  May I tell him so, love?\'\n\n\'Tell him, dear Grace,\' replied Marion, \'that there never was a \ntrust so generously, nobly, steadfastly discharged; and that I have \nloved YOU, all the time, dearer and dearer every day; and O! how \ndearly now!\'\n\n\'Nay,\' said her cheerful sister, returning her embrace, \'I can \nscarcely tell him that; we will leave my deserts to Alfred\'s \nimagination.  It will be liberal enough, dear Marion; like your \nown.\'\n\nWith that, she resumed the work she had for a moment laid down, \nwhen her sister spoke so fervently:  and with it the old song the \nDoctor liked to hear.  And the Doctor, still reposing in his easy-\nchair, with his slippered feet stretched out before him on the rug, \nlistened to the tune, and beat time on his knee with Alfred\'s \nletter, and looked at his two daughters, and thought that among the \nmany trifles of the trifling world, these trifles were agreeable \nenough.\n\nClemency Newcome, in the meantime, having accomplished her mission \nand lingered in the room until she had made herself a party to the \nnews, descended to the kitchen, where her coadjutor, Mr. Britain, \nwas regaling after supper, surrounded by such a plentiful \ncollection of bright pot-lids, well-scoured saucepans, burnished \ndinner-covers, gleaming kettles, and other tokens of her \nindustrious habits, arranged upon the walls and shelves, that he \nsat as in the centre of a hall of mirrors.  The majority did not \ngive forth very flattering portraits of him, certainly; nor were \nthey by any means unanimous in their reflections; as some made him \nvery long-faced, others very broad-faced, some tolerably well-\nlooking, others vastly ill-looking, according to their several \nmanners of reflecting:  which were as various, in respect of one \nfact, as those of so many kinds of men.  But they all agreed that \nin the midst of them sat, quite at his ease, an individual with a \npipe in his mouth, and a jug of beer at his elbow, who nodded \ncondescendingly to Clemency, when she stationed herself at the same \ntable.\n\n\'Well, Clemmy,\' said Britain, \'how are you by this time, and what\'s \nthe news?\'\n\nClemency told him the news, which he received very graciously.  A \ngracious change had come over Benjamin from head to foot.  He was \nmuch broader, much redder, much more cheerful, and much jollier in \nall respects.  It seemed as if his face had been tied up in a knot \nbefore, and was now untwisted and smoothed out.\n\n\'There\'ll be another job for Snitchey and Craggs, I suppose,\' he \nobserved, puffing slowly at his pipe.  \'More witnessing for you and \nme, perhaps, Clemmy!\'\n\n\'Lor!\' replied his fair companion, with her favourite twist of her \nfavourite joints.  \'I wish it was me, Britain!\'\n\n\'Wish what was you?\'\n\n\'A-going to be married,\' said Clemency.\n\nBenjamin took his pipe out of his mouth and laughed heartily.  \n\'Yes! you\'re a likely subject for that!\' he said.  \'Poor Clem!\'  \nClemency for her part laughed as heartily as he, and seemed as much \namused by the idea.  \'Yes,\' she assented, \'I\'m a likely subject for \nthat; an\'t I?\'\n\n\'YOU\'LL never be married, you know,\' said Mr. Britain, resuming his \npipe.\n\n\'Don\'t you think I ever shall though?\' said Clemency, in perfect \ngood faith.\n\nMr. Britain shook his head.  \'Not a chance of it!\'\n\n\'Only think!\' said Clemency.  \'Well! - I suppose you mean to, \nBritain, one of these days; don\'t you?\'\n\nA question so abrupt, upon a subject so momentous, required \nconsideration.  After blowing out a great cloud of smoke, and \nlooking at it with his head now on this side and now on that, as if \nit were actually the question, and he were surveying it in various \naspects, Mr. Britain replied that he wasn\'t altogether clear about \nit, but - ye-es - he thought he might come to that at last.\n\n\'I wish her joy, whoever she may be!\' cried Clemency.\n\n\'Oh she\'ll have that,\' said Benjamin, \'safe enough.\'\n\n\'But she wouldn\'t have led quite such a joyful life as she will \nlead, and wouldn\'t have had quite such a sociable sort of husband \nas she will have,\' said Clemency, spreading herself half over the \ntable, and staring retrospectively at the candle, \'if it hadn\'t \nbeen for - not that I went to do it, for it was accidental, I am \nsure - if it hadn\'t been for me; now would she, Britain?\'\n\n\'Certainly not,\' returned Mr. Britain, by this time in that high \nstate of appreciation of his pipe, when a man can open his mouth \nbut a very little way for speaking purposes; and sitting \nluxuriously immovable in his chair, can afford to turn only his \neyes towards a companion, and that very passively and gravely.  \n\'Oh!  I\'m greatly beholden to you, you know, Clem.\'\n\n\'Lor, how nice that is to think of!\' said Clemency.\n\nAt the same time, bringing her thoughts as well as her sight to \nbear upon the candle-grease, and becoming abruptly reminiscent of \nits healing qualities as a balsam, she anointed her left elbow with \na plentiful application of that remedy.\n\n\'You see I\'ve made a good many investigations of one sort and \nanother in my time,\' pursued Mr. Britain, with the profundity of a \nsage, \'having been always of an inquiring turn of mind; and I\'ve \nread a good many books about the general Rights of things and \nWrongs of things, for I went into the literary line myself, when I \nbegan life.\'\n\n\'Did you though!\' cried the admiring Clemency.\n\n\'Yes,\' said Mr. Britain:  \'I was hid for the best part of two years \nbehind a bookstall, ready to fly out if anybody pocketed a volume; \nand after that, I was light porter to a stay and mantua maker, in \nwhich capacity I was employed to carry about, in oilskin baskets, \nnothing but deceptions - which soured my spirits and disturbed my \nconfidence in human nature; and after that, I heard a world of \ndiscussions in this house, which soured my spirits fresh; and my \nopinion after all is, that, as a safe and comfortable sweetener of \nthe same, and as a pleasant guide through life, there\'s nothing \nlike a nutmeg-grater.\'\n\nClemency was about to offer a suggestion, but he stopped her by \nanticipating it.\n\n\'Com-bined,\' he added gravely, \'with a thimble.\'\n\n\'Do as you wold, you know, and cetrer, eh!\' observed Clemency, \nfolding her arms comfortably in her delight at this avowal, and \npatting her elbows.  \'Such a short cut, an\'t it?\'\n\n\'I\'m not sure,\' said Mr. Britain, \'that it\'s what would be \nconsidered good philosophy.  I\'ve my doubts about that; but it \nwears well, and saves a quantity of snarling, which the genuine \narticle don\'t always.\'\n\n\'See how you used to go on once, yourself, you know!\' said \nClemency.\n\n\'Ah!\' said Mr. Britain.  \'But the most extraordinary thing, Clemmy, \nis that I should live to be brought round, through you.  That\'s the \nstrange part of it.  Through you!  Why, I suppose you haven\'t so \nmuch as half an idea in your head.\'\n\nClemency, without taking the least offence, shook it, and laughed \nand hugged herself, and said, \'No, she didn\'t suppose she had.\'\n\n\'I\'m pretty sure of it,\' said Mr. Britain.\n\n\'Oh!  I dare say you\'re right,\' said Clemency.  \'I don\'t pretend to \nnone.  I don\'t want any.\'\n\nBenjamin took his pipe from his lips, and laughed till the tears \nran down his face.  \'What a natural you are, Clemmy!\' he said, \nshaking his head, with an infinite relish of the joke, and wiping \nhis eyes.  Clemency, without the smallest inclination to dispute \nit, did the like, and laughed as heartily as he.\n\n\'I can\'t help liking you,\' said Mr. Britain; \'you\'re a regular good \ncreature in your way, so shake hands, Clem.  Whatever happens, I\'ll \nalways take notice of you, and be a friend to you.\'\n\n\'Will you?\' returned Clemency.  \'Well! that\'s very good of you.\'\n\n\'Yes, yes,\' said Mr. Britain, giving her his pipe to knock the \nashes out of it; \'I\'ll stand by you.  Hark!  That\'s a curious \nnoise!\'\n\n\'Noise!\' repeated Clemency.\n\n\'A footstep outside.  Somebody dropping from the wall, it sounded \nlike,\' said Britain.  \'Are they all abed up-stairs?\'\n\n\'Yes, all abed by this time,\' she replied.\n\n\'Didn\'t you hear anything?\'\n\n\'No.\'\n\nThey both listened, but heard nothing.\n\n\'I tell you what,\' said Benjamin, taking down a lantern.  \'I\'ll \nhave a look round, before I go to bed myself, for satisfaction\'s \nsake.  Undo the door while I light this, Clemmy.\'\n\nClemency complied briskly; but observed as she did so, that he \nwould only have his walk for his pains, that it was all his fancy, \nand so forth.  Mr. Britain said \'very likely;\' but sallied out, \nnevertheless, armed with the poker, and casting the light of the \nlantern far and near in all directions.\n\n\'It\'s as quiet as a churchyard,\' said Clemency, looking after him; \n\'and almost as ghostly too!\'\n\nGlancing back into the kitchen, she cried fearfully, as a light \nfigure stole into her view, \'What\'s that!\'\n\n\'Hush!\' said Marion in an agitated whisper.  \'You have always loved \nme, have you not!\'\n\n\'Loved you, child!  You may be sure I have.\'\n\n\'I am sure.  And I may trust you, may I not?  There is no one else \njust now, in whom I CAN trust.\'\n\n\'Yes,\' said Clemency, with all her heart.\n\n\'There is some one out there,\' pointing to the door, \'whom I must \nsee, and speak with, to-night.  Michael Warden, for God\'s sake \nretire!  Not now!\'\n\nClemency started with surprise and trouble as, following the \ndirection of the speaker\'s eyes, she saw a dark figure standing in \nthe doorway.\n\n\'In another moment you may be discovered,\' said Marion.  \'Not now!  \nWait, if you can, in some concealment.  I will come presently.\'\n\nHe waved his hand to her, and was gone.  \'Don\'t go to bed.  Wait \nhere for me!\' said Marion, hurriedly.  \'I have been seeking to \nspeak to you for an hour past.  Oh, be true to me!\'\n\nEagerly seizing her bewildered hand, and pressing it with both her \nown to her breast - an action more expressive, in its passion of \nentreaty, than the most eloquent appeal in words, - Marion \nwithdrew; as the light of the returning lantern flashed into the \nroom.\n\n\'All still and peaceable.  Nobody there.  Fancy, I suppose,\' said \nMr. Britain, as he locked and barred the door.  \'One of the effects \nof having a lively imagination.  Halloa!  Why, what\'s the matter?\'\n\nClemency, who could not conceal the effects of her surprise and \nconcern, was sitting in a chair:  pale, and trembling from head to \nfoot.\n\n\'Matter!\' she repeated, chafing her hands and elbows, nervously, \nand looking anywhere but at him.  \'That\'s good in you, Britain, \nthat is!  After going and frightening one out of one\'s life with \nnoises and lanterns, and I don\'t know what all.  Matter!  Oh, yes!\'\n\n\'If you\'re frightened out of your life by a lantern, Clemmy,\' said \nMr. Britain, composedly blowing it out and hanging it up again, \n\'that apparition\'s very soon got rid of.  But you\'re as bold as \nbrass in general,\' he said, stopping to observe her; \'and were, \nafter the noise and the lantern too.  What have you taken into your \nhead?  Not an idea, eh?\'\n\nBut, as Clemency bade him good night very much after her usual \nfashion, and began to bustle about with a show of going to bed \nherself immediately, Little Britain, after giving utterance to the \noriginal remark that it was impossible to account for a woman\'s \nwhims, bade her good night in return, and taking up his candle \nstrolled drowsily away to bed.\n\nWhen all was quiet, Marion returned.\n\n\'Open the door,\' she said; \'and stand there close beside me, while \nI speak to him, outside.\'\n\nTimid as her manner was, it still evinced a resolute and settled \npurpose, such as Clemency could not resist.  She softly unbarred \nthe door:  but before turning the key, looked round on the young \ncreature waiting to issue forth when she should open it.\n\nThe face was not averted or cast down, but looking full upon her, \nin its pride of youth and beauty.  Some simple sense of the \nslightness of the barrier that interposed itself between the happy \nhome and honoured love of the fair girl, and what might be the \ndesolation of that home, and shipwreck of its dearest treasure, \nsmote so keenly on the tender heart of Clemency, and so filled it \nto overflowing with sorrow and compassion, that, bursting into \ntears, she threw her arms round Marion\'s neck.\n\n\'It\'s little that I know, my dear,\' cried Clemency, \'very little; \nbut I know that this should not be.  Think of what you do!\'\n\n\'I have thought of it many times,\' said Marion, gently.\n\n\'Once more,\' urged Clemency.  \'Till to-morrow.\'  Marion shook her \nhead.\n\n\'For Mr. Alfred\'s sake,\' said Clemency, with homely earnestness.  \n\'Him that you used to love so dearly, once!\'\n\nShe hid her face, upon the instant, in her hands, repeating \'Once!\' \nas if it rent her heart.\n\n\'Let me go out,\' said Clemency, soothing her.  \'I\'ll tell him what \nyou like.  Don\'t cross the door-step to-night.  I\'m sure no good \nwill come of it.  Oh, it was an unhappy day when Mr. Warden was \never brought here!  Think of your good father, darling - of your \nsister.\'\n\n\'I have,\' said Marion, hastily raising her head.  \'You don\'t know \nwhat I do.  I MUST speak to him.  You are the best and truest \nfriend in all the world for what you have said to me, but I must \ntake this step.  Will you go with me, Clemency,\' she kissed her on \nher friendly face, \'or shall I go alone?\'\n\nSorrowing and wondering, Clemency turned the key, and opened the \ndoor.  Into the dark and doubtful night that lay beyond the \nthreshold, Marion passed quickly, holding by her hand.\n\nIn the dark night he joined her, and they spoke together earnestly \nand long; and the hand that held so fast by Clemeney\'s, now \ntrembled, now turned deadly cold, now clasped and closed on hers, \nin the strong feeling of the speech it emphasised unconsciously.  \nWhen they returned, he followed to the door, and pausing there a \nmoment, seized the other hand, and pressed it to his lips.  Then, \nstealthily withdrew.\n\nThe door was barred and locked again, and once again she stood \nbeneath her father\'s roof.  Not bowed down by the secret that she \nbrought there, though so young; but, with that same expression on \nher face for which I had no name before, and shining through her \ntears.\n\nAgain she thanked and thanked her humble friend, and trusted to \nher, as she said, with confidence, implicitly.  Her chamber safely \nreached, she fell upon her knees; and with her secret weighing on \nher heart, could pray!\n\nCould rise up from her prayers, so tranquil and serene, and bending \nover her fond sister in her slumber, look upon her face and smile - \nthough sadly:  murmuring as she kissed her forehead, how that Grace \nhad been a mother to her, ever, and she loved her as a child!\n\nCould draw the passive arm about her neck when lying down to rest - \nit seemed to cling there, of its own will, protectingly and \ntenderly even in sleep - and breathe upon the parted lips, God \nbless her!\n\nCould sink into a peaceful sleep, herself; but for one dream, in \nwhich she cried out, in her innocent and touching voice, that she \nwas quite alone, and they had all forgotten her.\n\nA month soon passes, even at its tardiest pace.  The month \nappointed to elapse between that night and the return, was quick of \nfoot, and went by, like a vapour.\n\nThe day arrived.  A raging winter day, that shook the old house, \nsometimes, as if it shivered in the blast.  A day to make home \ndoubly home.  To give the chimney-corner new delights.  To shed a \nruddier glow upon the faces gathered round the hearth, and draw \neach fireside group into a closer and more social league, against \nthe roaring elements without.  Such a wild winter day as best \nprepares the way for shut-out night; for curtained rooms, and \ncheerful looks; for music, laughter, dancing, light, and jovial \nentertainment!\n\nAll these the Doctor had in store to welcome Alfred back.  They \nknew that he could not arrive till night; and they would make the \nnight air ring, he said, as he approached.  All his old friends \nshould congregate about him.  He should not miss a face that he had \nknown and liked.  No!  They should every one be there!\n\nSo, guests were bidden, and musicians were engaged, and tables \nspread, and floors prepared for active feet, and bountiful \nprovision made, of every hospitable kind.  Because it was the \nChristmas season, and his eyes were all unused to English holly and \nits sturdy green, the dancing-room was garlanded and hung with it; \nand the red berries gleamed an English welcome to him, peeping from \namong the leaves.\n\nIt was a busy day for all of them:  a busier day for none of them \nthan Grace, who noiselessly presided everywhere, and was the \ncheerful mind of all the preparations.  Many a time that day (as \nwell as many a time within the fleeting month preceding it), did \nClemency glance anxiously, and almost fearfully, at Marion.  She \nsaw her paler, perhaps, than usual; but there was a sweet composure \non her face that made it lovelier than ever.\n\nAt night when she was dressed, and wore upon her head a wreath that \nGrace had proudly twined about it - its mimic flowers were Alfred\'s \nfavourites, as Grace remembered when she chose them - that old \nexpression, pensive, almost sorrowful, and yet so spiritual, high, \nand stirring, sat again upon her brow, enhanced a hundred-fold.\n\n\'The next wreath I adjust on this fair head, will be a marriage \nwreath,\' said Grace; \'or I am no true prophet, dear.\'\n\nHer sister smiled, and held her in her arms.\n\n\'A moment, Grace.  Don\'t leave me yet.  Are you sure that I want \nnothing more?\'\n\nHer care was not for that.  It was her sister\'s face she thought \nof, and her eyes were fixed upon it, tenderly.\n\n\'My art,\' said Grace, \'can go no farther, dear girl; nor your \nbeauty.  I never saw you look so beautiful as now.\'\n\n\'I never was so happy,\' she returned.\n\n\'Ay, but there is a greater happiness in store.  In such another \nhome, as cheerful and as bright as this looks now,\' said Grace, \n\'Alfred and his young wife will soon be living.\'\n\nShe smiled again.  \'It is a happy home, Grace, in your fancy.  I \ncan see it in your eyes.  I know it WILL be happy, dear.  How glad \nI am to know it.\'\n\n\'Well,\' cried the Doctor, bustling in.  \'Here we are, all ready for \nAlfred, eh?  He can\'t be here until pretty late - an hour or so \nbefore midnight - so there\'ll be plenty of time for making merry \nbefore he comes.  He\'ll not find us with the ice unbroken.  Pile up \nthe fire here, Britain!  Let it shine upon the holly till it winks \nagain.  It\'s a world of nonsense, Puss; true lovers and all the \nrest of it - all nonsense; but we\'ll be nonsensical with the rest \nof \'em, and give our true lover a mad welcome.  Upon my word!\' said \nthe old Doctor, looking at his daughters proudly, \'I\'m not clear \nto-night, among other absurdities, but that I\'m the father of two \nhandsome girls.\'\n\n\'All that one of them has ever done, or may do - may do, dearest \nfather - to cause you pain or grief, forgive her,\' said Marion, \n\'forgive her now, when her heart is full.  Say that you forgive \nher.  That you will forgive her.  That she shall always share your \nlove, and -,\' and the rest was not said, for her face was hidden on \nthe old man\'s shoulder.\n\n\'Tut, tut, tut,\' said the Doctor gently.  \'Forgive!  What have I to \nforgive?  Heyday, if our true lovers come back to flurry us like \nthis, we must hold \'em at a distance; we must send expresses out to \nstop \'em short upon the road, and bring \'em on a mile or two a day, \nuntil we\'re properly prepared to meet \'em.  Kiss me, Puss.  \nForgive!  Why, what a silly child you are!  If you had vexed and \ncrossed me fifty times a day, instead of not at all, I\'d forgive \nyou everything, but such a supplication.  Kiss me again, Puss.  \nThere!  Prospective and retrospective - a clear score between us.  \nPile up the fire here!  Would you freeze the people on this bleak \nDecember night!  Let us be light, and warm, and merry, or I\'ll not \nforgive some of you!\'\n\nSo gaily the old Doctor carried it!  And the fire was piled up, and \nthe lights were bright, and company arrived, and a murmuring of \nlively tongues began, and already there was a pleasant air of \ncheerful excitement stirring through all the house.\n\nMore and more company came flocking in.  Bright eyes sparkled upon \nMarion; smiling lips gave her joy of his return; sage mothers \nfanned themselves, and hoped she mightn\'t be too youthful and \ninconstant for the quiet round of home; impetuous fathers fell into \ndisgrace for too much exaltation of her beauty; daughters envied \nher; sons envied him; innumerable pairs of lovers profited by the \noccasion; all were interested, animated, and expectant.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Craggs came arm in arm, but Mrs. Snitchey came alone.  \n\'Why, what\'s become of HIM?\' inquired the Doctor.\n\nThe feather of a Bird of Paradise in Mrs. Snitchey\'s turban, \ntrembled as if the Bird of Paradise were alive again, when she said \nthat doubtless Mr. Craggs knew.  SHE was never told.\n\n\'That nasty office,\' said Mrs. Craggs.\n\n\'I wish it was burnt down,\' said Mrs. Snitchey.\n\n\'He\'s - he\'s - there\'s a little matter of business that keeps my \npartner rather late,\' said Mr. Craggs, looking uneasily about him.\n\n\'Oh-h!  Business.  Don\'t tell me!\' said Mrs. Snitchey.\n\n\'WE know what business means,\' said Mrs. Craggs.\n\nBut their not knowing what it meant, was perhaps the reason why \nMrs. Snitchey\'s Bird of Paradise feather quivered so portentously, \nand why all the pendant bits on Mrs. Craggs\'s ear-rings shook like \nlittle bells.\n\n\'I wonder YOU could come away, Mr. Craggs,\' said his wife.\n\n\'Mr. Craggs is fortunate, I\'m sure!\' said Mrs. Snitchey.\n\n\'That office so engrosses \'em,\' said Mrs. Craggs.\n\n\'A person with an office has no business to be married at all,\' \nsaid Mrs. Snitchey.\n\nThen, Mrs. Snitchey said, within herself, that that look of hers \nhad pierced to Craggs\'s soul, and he knew it; and Mrs. Craggs \nobserved to Craggs, that \'his Snitcheys\' were deceiving him behind \nhis back, and he would find it out when it was too late.\n\nStill, Mr. Craggs, without much heeding these remarks, looked \nuneasily about until his eye rested on Grace, to whom he \nimmediately presented himself.\n\n\'Good evening, ma\'am,\' said Craggs.  \'You look charmingly.  Your - \nMiss - your sister, Miss Marion, is she - \'\n\n\'Oh, she\'s quite well, Mr. Craggs.\'\n\n\'Yes - I - is she here?\' asked Craggs.\n\n\'Here!  Don\'t you see her yonder?  Going to dance?\' said Grace.\n\nMr. Craggs put on his spectacles to see the better; looked at her \nthrough them, for some time; coughed; and put them, with an air of \nsatisfaction, in their sheath again, and in his pocket.\n\nNow the music struck up, and the dance commenced.  The bright fire \ncrackled and sparkled, rose and fell, as though it joined the dance \nitself, in right good fellowship.  Sometimes, it roared as if it \nwould make music too.  Sometimes, it flashed and beamed as if it \nwere the eye of the old room:  it winked too, sometimes, like a \nknowing patriarch, upon the youthful whisperers in corners.  \nSometimes, it sported with the holly-boughs; and, shining on the \nleaves by fits and starts, made them look as if they were in the \ncold winter night again, and fluttering in the wind.  Sometimes its \ngenial humour grew obstreperous, and passed all bounds; and then it \ncast into the room, among the twinkling feet, with a loud burst, a \nshower of harmless little sparks, and in its exultation leaped and \nbounded, like a mad thing, up the broad old chimney.\n\nAnother dance was near its close, when Mr. Snitchey touched his \npartner, who was looking on, upon the arm.\n\nMr. Craggs started, as if his familiar had been a spectre.\n\n\'Is he gone?\' he asked.\n\n\'Hush!  He has been with me,\' said Snitchey, \'for three hours and \nmore.  He went over everything.  He looked into all our \narrangements for him, and was very particular indeed.  He - Humph!\'\n\nThe dance was finished.  Marion passed close before him, as he \nspoke.  She did not observe him, or his partner; but, looked over \nher shoulder towards her sister in the distance, as she slowly made \nher way into the crowd, and passed out of their view.\n\n\'You see!  All safe and well,\' said Mr. Craggs.  \'He didn\'t recur \nto that subject, I suppose?\'\n\n\'Not a word.\'\n\n\'And is he really gone?  Is he safe away?\'\n\n\'He keeps to his word.  He drops down the river with the tide in \nthat shell of a boat of his, and so goes out to sea on this dark \nnight! - a dare-devil he is - before the wind.  There\'s no such \nlonely road anywhere else.  That\'s one thing.  The tide flows, he \nsays, an hour before midnight - about this time.  I\'m glad it\'s \nover.\'  Mr. Snitchey wiped his forehead, which looked hot and \nanxious.\n\n\'What do you think,\' said Mr. Craggs, \'about - \'\n\n\'Hush!\' replied his cautious partner, looking straight before him.  \n\'I understand you.  Don\'t mention names, and don\'t let us, seem to \nbe talking secrets.  I don\'t know what to think; and to tell you \nthe truth, I don\'t care now.  It\'s a great relief.  His self-love \ndeceived him, I suppose.  Perhaps the young lady coquetted a \nlittle.  The evidence would seem to point that way.  Alfred not \narrived?\'\n\n\'Not yet,\' said Mr. Craggs.  \'Expected every minute.\'\n\n\'Good.\' Mr. Snitchey wiped his forehead again.  \'It\'s a great \nrelief.  I haven\'t been so nervous since we\'ve been in partnership.  \nI intend to spend the evening now, Mr. Craggs.\'\n\nMrs. Craggs and Mrs. Snitchey joined them as he announced this \nintention.  The Bird of Paradise was in a state of extreme \nvibration, and the little bells were ringing quite audibly.\n\n\'It has been the theme of general comment, Mr. Snitchey,\' said Mrs. \nSnitchey.  \'I hope the office is satisfied.\'\n\n\'Satisfied with what, my dear?\' asked Mr. Snitchey.\n\n\'With the exposure of a defenceless woman to ridicule and remark,\' \nreturned his wife.  \'That is quite in the way of the office, THAT \nis.\'\n\n\'I really, myself,\' said Mrs. Craggs, \'have been so long accustomed \nto connect the office with everything opposed to domesticity, that \nI am glad to know it as the avowed enemy of my peace.  There is \nsomething honest in that, at all events.\'\n\n\'My dear,\' urged Mr. Craggs, \'your good opinion is invaluable, but \nI never avowed that the office was the enemy of your peace.\'\n\n\'No,\' said Mrs. Craggs, ringing a perfect peal upon the little \nbells.  \'Not you, indeed.  You wouldn\'t be worthy of the office, if \nyou had the candour to.\'\n\n\'As to my having been away to-night, my dear,\' said Mr. Snitchey, \ngiving her his arm, \'the deprivation has been mine, I\'m sure; but, \nas Mr. Craggs knows - \'\n\nMrs. Snitchey cut this reference very short by hitching her husband \nto a distance, and asking him to look at that man.  To do her the \nfavour to look at him!\n\n\'At which man, my dear?\' said Mr. Snitchey.\n\n\'Your chosen companion; I\'M no companion to you, Mr. Snitchey.\'\n\n\'Yes, yes, you are, my dear,\' he interposed.\n\n\'No, no, I\'m not,\' said Mrs. Snitchey with a majestic smile.  \'I \nknow my station.  Will you look at your chosen companion, Mr. \nSnitchey; at your referee, at the keeper of your secrets, at the \nman you trust; at your other self, in short?\'\n\nThe habitual association of Self with Craggs, occasioned Mr. \nSnitchey to look in that direction.\n\n\'If you can look that man in the eye this night,\' said Mrs. \nSnitchey, \'and not know that you are deluded, practised upon, made \nthe victim of his arts, and bent down prostrate to his will by some \nunaccountable fascination which it is impossible to explain and \nagainst which no warning of mine is of the least avail, all I can \nsay is - I pity you!\'\n\nAt the very same moment Mrs. Craggs was oracular on the cross \nsubject.  Was it possible, she said, that Craggs could so blind \nhimself to his Snitcheys, as not to feel his true position?  Did he \nmean to say that he had seen his Snitcheys come into that room, and \ndidn\'t plainly see that there was reservation, cunning, treachery, \nin the man? Would he tell her that his very action, when he wiped \nhis forehead and looked so stealthily about him, didn\'t show that \nthere was something weighing on the conscience of his precious \nSnitcheys (if he had a conscience), that wouldn\'t bear the light?  \nDid anybody but his Snitcheys come to festive entertainments like a \nburglar? - which, by the way, was hardly a clear illustration of \nthe case, as he had walked in very mildly at the door.  And would \nhe still assert to her at noon-day (it being nearly midnight), that \nhis Snitcheys were to be justified through thick and thin, against \nall facts, and reason, and experience?\n\nNeither Snitchey nor Craggs openly attempted to stem the current \nwhich had thus set in, but, both were content to be carried gently \nalong it, until its force abated.  This happened at about the same \ntime as a general movement for a country dance; when Mr. Snitchey \nproposed himself as a partner to Mrs. Craggs, and Mr. Craggs \ngallantly offered himself to Mrs. Snitchey; and after some such \nslight evasions as \'why don\'t you ask somebody else?\' and \'you\'ll \nbe glad, I know, if I decline,\' and \'I wonder you can dance out of \nthe office\' (but this jocosely now), each lady graciously accepted, \nand took her place.\n\nIt was an old custom among them, indeed, to do so, and to pair off, \nin like manner, at dinners and suppers; for they were excellent \nfriends, and on a footing of easy familiarity.  Perhaps the false \nCraggs and the wicked Snitchey were a recognised fiction with the \ntwo wives, as Doe and Roe, incessantly running up and down \nbailiwicks, were with the two husbands:  or, perhaps the ladies had \ninstituted, and taken upon themselves, these two shares in the \nbusiness, rather than be left out of it altogether.  But, certain \nit is, that each wife went as gravely and steadily to work in her \nvocation as her husband did in his, and would have considered it \nalmost impossible for the Firm to maintain a successful and \nrespectable existence, without her laudable exertions.\n\nBut, now, the Bird of Paradise was seen to flutter down the middle; \nand the little bells began to bounce and jingle in poussette; and \nthe Doctor\'s rosy face spun round and round, like an expressive \npegtop highly varnished; and breathless Mr. Craggs began to doubt \nalready, whether country dancing had been made \'too easy,\' like the \nrest of life; and Mr. Snitchey, with his nimble cuts and capers, \nfooted it for Self and Craggs, and half-a-dozen more.\n\nNow, too, the fire took fresh courage, favoured by the lively wind \nthe dance awakened, and burnt clear and high.  It was the Genius of \nthe room, and present everywhere.  It shone in people\'s eyes, it \nsparkled in the jewels on the snowy necks of girls, it twinkled at \ntheir ears as if it whispered to them slyly, it flashed about their \nwaists, it flickered on the ground and made it rosy for their feet, \nit bloomed upon the ceiling that its glow might set off their \nbright faces, and it kindled up a general illumination in Mrs. \nCraggs\'s little belfry.\n\nNow, too, the lively air that fanned it, grew less gentle as the \nmusic quickened and the dance proceeded with new spirit; and a \nbreeze arose that made the leaves and berries dance upon the wall, \nas they had often done upon the trees; and the breeze rustled in \nthe room as if an invisible company of fairies, treading in the \nfoot-steps of the good substantial revellers, were whirling after \nthem.  Now, too, no feature of the Doctor\'s face could be \ndistinguished as he spun and spun; and now there seemed a dozen \nBirds of Paradise in fitful flight; and now there were a thousand \nlittle bells at work; and now a fleet of flying skirts was ruffled \nby a little tempest, when the music gave in, and the dance was \nover.\n\nHot and breathless as the Doctor was, it only made him the more \nimpatient for Alfred\'s coming.\n\n\'Anything been seen, Britain?  Anything been heard?\'\n\n\'Too dark to see far, sir.  Too much noise inside the house to \nhear.\'\n\n\'That\'s right!  The gayer welcome for him.  How goes the time?\'\n\n\'Just twelve, sir.  He can\'t be long, sir.\'\n\n\'Stir up the fire, and throw another log upon it,\' said the Doctor.  \n\'Let him see his welcome blazing out upon the night - good boy! - \nas he comes along!\'\n\nHe saw it - Yes!  From the chaise he caught the light, as he turned \nthe corner by the old church.  He knew the room from which it \nshone.  He saw the wintry branches of the old trees between the \nlight and him.  He knew that one of those trees rustled musically \nin the summer time at the window of Marion\'s chamber.\n\nThe tears were in his eyes.  His heart throbbed so violently that \nhe could hardly bear his happiness.  How often he had thought of \nthis time - pictured it under all circumstances - feared that it \nmight never come - yearned, and wearied for it - far away!\n\nAgain the light!  Distinct and ruddy; kindled, he knew, to give him \nwelcome, and to speed him home.  He beckoned with his hand, and \nwaved his hat, and cheered out, loud, as if the light were they, \nand they could see and hear him, as he dashed towards them through \nthe mud and mire, triumphantly.\n\nStop!  He knew the Doctor, and understood what he had done.  He \nwould not let it be a surprise to them.  But he could make it one, \nyet, by going forward on foot.  If the orchard-gate were open, he \ncould enter there; if not, the wall was easily climbed, as he knew \nof old; and he would be among them in an instant.\n\nHe dismounted from the chaise, and telling the driver - even that \nwas not easy in his agitation - to remain behind for a few minutes, \nand then to follow slowly, ran on with exceeding swiftness, tried \nthe gate, scaled the wall, jumped down on the other side, and stood \npanting in the old orchard.\n\nThere was a frosty rime upon the trees, which, in the faint light \nof the clouded moon, hung upon the smaller branches like dead \ngarlands.  Withered leaves crackled and snapped beneath his feet, \nas he crept softly on towards the house.  The desolation of a \nwinter night sat brooding on the earth, and in the sky.  But, the \nred light came cheerily towards him from the windows; figures \npassed and repassed there; and the hum and murmur of voices greeted \nhis ear sweetly.\n\nListening for hers:  attempting, as he crept on, to detach it from \nthe rest, and half believing that he heard it:  he had nearly \nreached the door, when it was abruptly opened, and a figure coming \nout encountered his.  It instantly recoiled with a half-suppressed \ncry.\n\n\'Clemency,\' he said, \'don\'t you know me?\'\n\n\'Don\'t come in!\' she answered, pushing him back.  \'Go away.  Don\'t \nask me why.  Don\'t come in.\'\n\n\'What is the matter?\' he exclaimed.\n\n\'I don\'t know.  I - I am afraid to think.  Go back.  Hark!\'\n\nThere was a sudden tumult in the house.  She put her hands upon her \nears.  A wild scream, such as no hands could shut out, was heard; \nand Grace - distraction in her looks and manner - rushed out at the \ndoor.\n\n\'Grace!\'  He caught her in his arms.  \'What is it!  Is she dead!\'\n\nShe disengaged herself, as if to recognise his face, and fell down \nat his feet.\n\nA crowd of figures came about them from the house.  Among them was \nher father, with a paper in his hand.\n\n\'What is it!\' cried Alfred, grasping his hair with his hands, and \nlooking in an agony from face to face, as he bent upon his knee \nbeside the insensible girl.  \'Will no one look at me?  Will no one \nspeak to me?  Does no one know me?  Is there no voice among you \nall, to tell me what it is!\'\n\nThere was a murmur among them.  \'She is gone.\'\n\n\'Gone!\' he echoed.\n\n\'Fled, my dear Alfred!\' said the Doctor, in a broken voice, and \nwith his hands before his face.  \'Gone from her home and us.  To-\nnight!  She writes that she has made her innocent and blameless \nchoice - entreats that we will forgive her - prays that we will not \nforget her - and is gone.\'\n\n\'With whom?  Where?\'\n\nHe started up, as if to follow in pursuit; but, when they gave way \nto let him pass, looked wildly round upon them, staggered back, and \nsunk down in his former attitude, clasping one of Grace\'s cold \nhands in his own.\n\nThere was a hurried running to and fro, confusion, noise, disorder, \nand no purpose.  Some proceeded to disperse themselves about the \nroads, and some took horse, and some got lights, and some conversed \ntogether, urging that there was no trace or track to follow.  Some \napproached him kindly, with the view of offering consolation; some \nadmonished him that Grace must be removed into the house, and that \nhe prevented it.  He never heard them, and he never moved.\n\nThe snow fell fast and thick.  He looked up for a moment in the \nair, and thought that those white ashes strewn upon his hopes and \nmisery, were suited to them well.  He looked round on the whitening \nground, and thought how Marion\'s foot-prints would be hushed and \ncovered up, as soon as made, and even that remembrance of her \nblotted out.  But he never felt the weather and he never stirred.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III - Part The Third\n\n\n\nTHE world had grown six years older since that night of the return.  \nIt was a warm autumn afternoon, and there had been heavy rain.  The \nsun burst suddenly from among the clouds; and the old battle-\nground, sparkling brilliantly and cheerfully at sight of it in one \ngreen place, flashed a responsive welcome there, which spread along \nthe country side as if a joyful beacon had been lighted up, and \nanswered from a thousand stations.\n\nHow beautiful the landscape kindling in the light, and that \nluxuriant influence passing on like a celestial presence, \nbrightening everything!  The wood, a sombre mass before, revealed \nits varied tints of yellow, green, brown, red:  its different forms \nof trees, with raindrops glittering on their leaves and twinkling \nas they fell.  The verdant meadow-land, bright and glowing, seemed \nas if it had been blind, a minute since, and now had found a sense \nof sight where-with to look up at the shining sky.  Corn-fields, \nhedge-rows, fences, homesteads, and clustered roofs, the steeple of \nthe church, the stream, the water-mill, all sprang out of the \ngloomy darkness smiling.  Birds sang sweetly, flowers raised their \ndrooping heads, fresh scents arose from the invigorated ground; the \nblue expanse above extended and diffused itself; already the sun\'s \nslanting rays pierced mortally the sullen bank of cloud that \nlingered in its flight; and a rainbow, spirit of all the colours \nthat adorned the earth and sky, spanned the whole arch with its \ntriumphant glory.\n\nAt such a time, one little roadside Inn, snugly sheltered behind a \ngreat elm-tree with a rare seat for idlers encircling its capacious \nbole, addressed a cheerful front towards the traveller, as a house \nof entertainment ought, and tempted him with many mute but \nsignificant assurances of a comfortable welcome.  The ruddy sign-\nboard perched up in the tree, with its golden letters winking in \nthe sun, ogled the passer-by, from among the green leaves, like a \njolly face, and promised good cheer.  The horse-trough, full of \nclear fresh water, and the ground below it sprinkled with droppings \nof fragrant hay, made every horse that passed, prick up his ears.  \nThe crimson curtains in the lower rooms, and the pure white \nhangings in the little bed-chambers above, beckoned, Come in! with \nevery breath of air.  Upon the bright green shutters, there were \ngolden legends about beer and ale, and neat wines, and good beds; \nand an affecting picture of a brown jug frothing over at the top.  \nUpon the window-sills were flowering plants in bright red pots, \nwhich made a lively show against the white front of the house; and \nin the darkness of the doorway there were streaks of light, which \nglanced off from the surfaces of bottles and tankards.\n\nOn the door-step, appeared a proper figure of a landlord, too; for, \nthough he was a short man, he was round and broad, and stood with \nhis hands in his pockets, and his legs just wide enough apart to \nexpress a mind at rest upon the subject of the cellar, and an easy \nconfidence - too calm and virtuous to become a swagger - in the \ngeneral resources of the Inn.  The superabundant moisture, \ntrickling from everything after the late rain, set him off well.  \nNothing near him was thirsty.  Certain top-heavy dahlias, looking \nover the palings of his neat well-ordered garden, had swilled as \nmuch as they could carry - perhaps a trifle more - and may have \nbeen the worse for liquor; but the sweet-briar, roses, wall-\nflowers, the plants at the windows, and the leaves on the old tree, \nwere in the beaming state of moderate company that had taken no \nmore than was wholesome for them, and had served to develop their \nbest qualities.  Sprinkling dewy drops about them on the ground, \nthey seemed profuse of innocent and sparkling mirth, that did good \nwhere it lighted, softening neglected corners which the steady rain \ncould seldom reach, and hurting nothing.\n\nThis village Inn had assumed, on being established, an uncommon \nsign.  It was called The Nutmeg-Grater.  And underneath that \nhousehold word, was inscribed, up in the tree, on the same flaming \nboard, and in the like golden characters, By Benjamin Britain.\n\nAt a second glance, and on a more minute examination of his face, \nyou might have known that it was no other than Benjamin Britain \nhimself who stood in the doorway - reasonably changed by time, but \nfor the better; a very comfortable host indeed.\n\n\'Mrs. B.,\' said Mr. Britain, looking down the road, \'is rather \nlate.  It\'s tea-time.\'\n\nAs there was no Mrs. Britain coming, he strolled leisurely out into \nthe road and looked up at the house, very much to his satisfaction.  \n\'It\'s just the sort of house,\' said Benjamin, \'I should wish to \nstop at, if I didn\'t keep it.\'\n\nThen, he strolled towards the garden-paling, and took a look at the \ndahlias.  They looked over at him, with a helpless drowsy hanging \nof their heads:  which bobbed again, as the heavy drops of wet \ndripped off them.\n\n\'You must be looked after,\' said Benjamin.  \'Memorandum, not to \nforget to tell her so.  She\'s a long time coming!\'\n\nMr. Britain\'s better half seemed to be by so very much his better \nhalf, that his own moiety of himself was utterly cast away and \nhelpless without her.\n\n\'She hadn\'t much to do, I think,\' said Ben.  \'There were a few \nlittle matters of business after market, but not many.  Oh! here we \nare at last!\'\n\nA chaise-cart, driven by a boy, came clattering along the road:  \nand seated in it, in a chair, with a large well-saturated umbrella \nspread out to dry behind her, was the plump figure of a matronly \nwoman, with her bare arms folded across a basket which she carried \non her knee, several other baskets and parcels lying crowded around \nher, and a certain bright good nature in her face and contented \nawkwardness in her manner, as she jogged to and fro with the motion \nof her carriage, which smacked of old times, even in the distance.  \nUpon her nearer approach, this relish of by-gone days was not \ndiminished; and when the cart stopped at the Nutmeg-Grater door, a \npair of shoes, alighting from it, slipped nimbly through Mr. \nBritain\'s open arms, and came down with a substantial weight upon \nthe pathway, which shoes could hardly have belonged to any one but \nClemency Newcome.\n\nIn fact they did belong to her, and she stood in them, and a rosy \ncomfortable-looking soul she was:  with as much soap on her glossy \nface as in times of yore, but with whole elbows now, that had grown \nquite dimpled in her improved condition.\n\n\'You\'re late, Clemmy!\' said Mr. Britain.\n\n\'Why, you see, Ben, I\'ve had a deal to do!\' she replied, looking \nbusily after the safe removal into the house of all the packages \nand baskets:  \'eight, nine, ten - where\'s eleven?  Oh! my basket\'s \neleven!  It\'s all right.  Put the horse up, Harry, and if he coughs \nagain give him a warm mash to-night.  Eight, nine, ten.  Why, \nwhere\'s eleven?  Oh! forgot, it\'s all right.  How\'s the children, \nBen?\'\n\n\'Hearty, Clemmy, hearty.\'\n\n\'Bless their precious faces!\' said Mrs. Britain, unbonneting her \nown round countenance (for she and her husband were by this time in \nthe bar), and smoothing her hair with her open hands.  \'Give us a \nkiss, old man!\'\n\nMr. Britain promptly complied.\n\n\'I think,\' said Mrs. Britain, applying herself to her pockets and \ndrawing forth an immense bulk of thin books and crumpled papers:  a \nvery kennel of dogs\'-ears:  \'I\'ve done everything.  Bills all \nsettled - turnips sold - brewer\'s account looked into and paid - \n\'bacco pipes ordered - seventeen pound four, paid into the Bank - \nDoctor Heathfield\'s charge for little Clem - you\'ll guess what that \nis - Doctor Heathfield won\'t take nothing again, Ben.\'\n\n\'I thought he wouldn\'t,\' returned Ben.\n\n\'No.  He says whatever family you was to have, Ben, he\'d never put \nyou to the cost of a halfpenny.  Not if you was to have twenty.\'\n\nMr. Britain\'s face assumed a serious expression, and he looked hard \nat the wall.\n\n\'An\'t it kind of him?\' said Clemency.\n\n\'Very,\' returned Mr. Britain.  \'It\'s the sort of kindness that I \nwouldn\'t presume upon, on any account.\'\n\n\'No,\' retorted Clemency.  \'Of course not.  Then there\'s the pony - \nhe fetched eight pound two; and that an\'t bad, is it?\'\n\n\'It\'s very good,\' said Ben.\n\n\'I\'m glad you\'re pleased!\' exclaimed his wife.  \'I thought you \nwould be; and I think that\'s all, and so no more at present from \nyours and cetrer, C. Britain.  Ha ha ha! There!  Take all the \npapers, and lock \'em up.  Oh!  Wait a minute.  Here\'s a printed \nbill to stick on the wall.  Wet from the printer\'s.  How nice it \nsmells!\'\n\n\'What\'s this?\' said Ben, looking over the document.\n\n\'I don\'t know,\' replied his wife.  \'I haven\'t read a word of it.\'\n\n\'\"To be sold by Auction,\"\' read the host of the Nutmeg-Grater, \n\'\"unless previously disposed of by private contract.\"\'\n\n\'They always put that,\' said Clemency.\n\n\'Yes, but they don\'t always put this,\' he returned.  \'Look here, \n\"Mansion,\" &c. - \"offices,\" &c., \"shrubberies,\" &c., \"ring fence,\" \n&c. \"Messrs. Snitchey and Craggs,\" &c., \"ornamental portion of the \nunencumbered freehold property of Michael Warden, Esquire, \nintending to continue to reside abroad\"!\'\n\n\'Intending to continue to reside abroad!\' repeated Clemency.\n\n\'Here it is,\' said Britain.  \'Look!\'\n\n\'And it was only this very day that I heard it whispered at the old \nhouse, that better and plainer news had been half promised of her, \nsoon!\' said Clemency, shaking her head sorrowfully, and patting her \nelbows as if the recollection of old times unconsciously awakened \nher old habits.  \'Dear, dear, dear!  There\'ll be heavy hearts, Ben, \nyonder.\'\n\nMr. Britain heaved a sigh, and shook his head, and said he couldn\'t \nmake it out:  he had left off trying long ago.  With that remark, \nhe applied himself to putting up the bill just inside the bar \nwindow.  Clemency, after meditating in silence for a few moments, \nroused herself, cleared her thoughtful brow, and bustled off to \nlook after the children.\n\nThough the host of the Nutmeg-Grater had a lively regard for his \ngood-wife, it was of the old patronising kind, and she amused him \nmightily.  Nothing would have astonished him so much, as to have \nknown for certain from any third party, that it was she who managed \nthe whole house, and made him, by her plain straightforward thrift, \ngood-humour, honesty, and industry, a thriving man.  So easy it is, \nin any degree of life (as the world very often finds it), to take \nthose cheerful natures that never assert their merit, at their own \nmodest valuation; and to conceive a flippant liking of people for \ntheir outward oddities and eccentricities, whose innate worth, if \nwe would look so far, might make us blush in the comparison!\n\nIt was comfortable to Mr. Britain, to think of his own \ncondescension in having married Clemency.  She was a perpetual \ntestimony to him of the goodness of his heart, and the kindness of \nhis disposition; and he felt that her being an excellent wife was \nan illustration of the old precept that virtue is its own reward.\n\nHe had finished wafering up the bill, and had locked the vouchers \nfor her day\'s proceedings in the cupboard - chuckling all the time, \nover her capacity for business - when, returning with the news that \nthe two Master Britains were playing in the coach-house under the \nsuperintendence of one Betsey, and that little Clem was sleeping \n\'like a picture,\' she sat down to tea, which had awaited her \narrival, on a little table.  It was a very neat little bar, with \nthe usual display of bottles and glasses; a sedate clock, right to \nthe minute (it was half-past five); everything in its place, and \neverything furbished and polished up to the very utmost.\n\n\'It\'s the first time I\'ve sat down quietly to-day, I declare,\' said \nMrs. Britain, taking a long breath, as if she had sat down for the \nnight; but getting up again immediately to hand her husband his \ntea, and cut him his bread-and-butter; \'how that bill does set me \nthinking of old times!\'\n\n\'Ah!\' said Mr. Britain, handling his saucer like an oyster, and \ndisposing of its contents on the same principle.\n\n\'That same Mr. Michael Warden,\' said Clemency, shaking her head at \nthe notice of sale, \'lost me my old place.\'\n\n\'And got you your husband,\' said Mr. Britain.\n\n\'Well!  So he did,\' retorted Clemency, \'and many thanks to him.\'\n\n\'Man\'s the creature of habit,\' said Mr. Britain, surveying her, \nover his saucer.  \'I had somehow got used to you, Clem; and I found \nI shouldn\'t be able to get on without you.  So we went and got made \nman and wife.  Ha! ha!  We!  Who\'d have thought it!\'\n\n\'Who indeed!\' cried Clemency.  \'It was very good of you, Ben.\'\n\n\'No, no, no,\' replied Mr. Britain, with an air of self-denial.  \n\'Nothing worth mentioning.\'\n\n\'Oh yes it was, Ben,\' said his wife, with great simplicity; \'I\'m \nsure I think so, and am very much obliged to you.  Ah!\' looking \nagain at the bill; \'when she was known to be gone, and out of \nreach, dear girl, I couldn\'t help telling - for her sake quite as \nmuch as theirs - what I knew, could I?\'\n\n\'You told it, anyhow,\' observed her husband.\n\n\'And Dr. Jeddler,\' pursued Clemency, putting down her tea-cup, and \nlooking thoughtfully at the bill, \'in his grief and passion turned \nme out of house and home!  I never have been so glad of anything in \nall my life, as that I didn\'t say an angry word to him, and hadn\'t \nany angry feeling towards him, even then; for he repented that \ntruly, afterwards.  How often he has sat in this room, and told me \nover and over again he was sorry for it! - the last time, only \nyesterday, when you were out.  How often he has sat in this room, \nand talked to me, hour after hour, about one thing and another, in \nwhich he made believe to be interested! - but only for the sake of \nthe days that are gone by, and because he knows she used to like \nme, Ben!\'\n\n\'Why, how did you ever come to catch a glimpse of that, Clem?\' \nasked her husband:  astonished that she should have a distinct \nperception of a truth which had only dimly suggested itself to his \ninquiring mind.\n\n\'I don\'t know, I\'m sure,\' said Clemency, blowing her tea, to cool \nit.  \'Bless you, I couldn\'t tell you, if you was to offer me a \nreward of a hundred pound.\'\n\nHe might have pursued this metaphysical subject but for her \ncatching a glimpse of a substantial fact behind him, in the shape \nof a gentleman attired in mourning, and cloaked and booted like a \nrider on horseback, who stood at the bar-door.  He seemed attentive \nto their conversation, and not at all impatient to interrupt it.\n\nClemency hastily rose at this sight.  Mr. Britain also rose and \nsaluted the guest.  \'Will you please to walk up-stairs, sir?  \nThere\'s a very nice room up-stairs, sir.\'\n\n\'Thank you,\' said the stranger, looking earnestly at Mr. Britain\'s \nwife.  \'May I come in here?\'\n\n\'Oh, surely, if you like, sir,\' returned Clemency, admitting him.\n\n\'What would you please to want, sir?\'\n\nThe bill had caught his eye, and he was reading it.\n\n\'Excellent property that, sir,\' observed Mr. Britain.\n\nHe made no answer; but, turning round, when he had finished \nreading, looked at Clemency with the same observant curiosity as \nbefore.  \'You were asking me,\' - he said, still looking at her, - \n\'What you would please to take, sir,\' answered Clemency, stealing a \nglance at him in return.\n\n\'If you will let me have a draught of ale,\' he said, moving to a \ntable by the window, \'and will let me have it here, without being \nany interruption to your meal, I shall be much obliged to you.\'  He \nsat down as he spoke, without any further parley, and looked out at \nthe prospect.  He was an easy, well-knit figure of a man in the \nprime of life.  His face, much browned by the sun, was shaded by a \nquantity of dark hair; and he wore a moustache.  His beer being set \nbefore him, he filled out a glass, and drank, good-humouredly, to \nthe house; adding, as he put the tumbler down again:\n\n\'It\'s a new house, is it not?\'\n\n\'Not particularly new, sir,\' replied Mr. Britain.\n\n\'Between five and six years old,\' said Clemency; speaking very \ndistinctly.\n\n\'I think I heard you mention Dr. Jeddler\'s name, as I came in,\' \ninquired the stranger.  \'That bill reminds me of him; for I happen \nto know something of that story, by hearsay, and through certain \nconnexions of mine. - Is the old man living?\'\n\n\'Yes, he\'s living, sir,\' said Clemency.\n\n\'Much changed?\'\n\n\'Since when, sir?\' returned Clemency, with remarkable emphasis and \nexpression.\n\n\'Since his daughter - went away.\'\n\n\'Yes! he\'s greatly changed since then,\' said Clemency.  \'He\'s grey \nand old, and hasn\'t the same way with him at all; but, I think he\'s \nhappy now.  He has taken on with his sister since then, and goes to \nsee her very often.  That did him good, directly.  At first, he was \nsadly broken down; and it was enough to make one\'s heart bleed, to \nsee him wandering about, railing at the world; but a great change \nfor the better came over him after a year or two, and then he began \nto like to talk about his lost daughter, and to praise her, ay and \nthe world too! and was never tired of saying, with the tears in his \npoor eyes, how beautiful and good she was.  He had forgiven her \nthen.  That was about the same time as Miss Grace\'s marriage.  \nBritain, you remember?\'\n\nMr. Britain remembered very well.\n\n\'The sister is married then,\' returned the stranger.  He paused for \nsome time before he asked, \'To whom?\'\n\nClemency narrowly escaped oversetting the tea-board, in her emotion \nat this question.\n\n\'Did YOU never hear?\' she said.\n\n\'I should like to hear,\' he replied, as he filled his glass again, \nand raised it to his lips.\n\n\'Ah!  It would be a long story, if it was properly told,\' said \nClemency, resting her chin on the palm of her left hand, and \nsupporting that elbow on her right hand, as she shook her head, and \nlooked back through the intervening years, as if she were looking \nat a fire.  \'It would be a long story, I am sure.\'\n\n\'But told as a short one,\' suggested the stranger.\n\nTold as a short one,\' repeated Clemency in the same thoughtful \ntone, and without any apparent reference to him, or consciousness \nof having auditors, \'what would there be to tell?  That they \ngrieved together, and remembered her together, like a person dead; \nthat they were so tender of her, never would reproach her, called \nher back to one another as she used to be, and found excuses for \nher!  Every one knows that.  I\'m sure I do.  No one better,\' added \nClemency, wiping her eyes with her hand.\n\n\'And so,\' suggested the stranger.\n\n\'And so,\' said Clemency, taking him up mechanically, and without \nany change in her attitude or manner, \'they at last were married.  \nThey were married on her birth-day - it comes round again to-morrow \n- very quiet, very humble like, but very happy.  Mr. Alfred said, \none night when they were walking in the orchard, \"Grace, shall our \nwedding-day be Marion\'s birth-day?\"  And it was.\'\n\n\'And they have lived happily together?\' said the stranger.\n\n\'Ay,\' said Clemency.  \'No two people ever more so.  They have had \nno sorrow but this.\'\n\nShe raised her head as with a sudden attention to the circumstances \nunder which she was recalling these events, and looked quickly at \nthe stranger.  Seeing that his face was turned toward the window, \nand that he seemed intent upon the prospect, she made some eager \nsigns to her husband, and pointed to the bill, and moved her mouth \nas if she were repeating with great energy, one word or phrase to \nhim over and over again.  As she uttered no sound, and as her dumb \nmotions like most of her gestures were of a very extraordinary \nkind, this unintelligible conduct reduced Mr. Britain to the \nconfines of despair.  He stared at the table, at the stranger, at \nthe spoons, at his wife - followed her pantomime with looks of deep \namazement and perplexity - asked in the same language, was it \nproperty in danger, was it he in danger, was it she - answered her \nsignals with other signals expressive of the deepest distress and \nconfusion - followed the motions of her lips - guessed half aloud \n\'milk and water,\' \'monthly warning,\' \'mice and walnuts\' - and \ncouldn\'t approach her meaning.\n\nClemency gave it up at last, as a hopeless attempt; and moving her \nchair by very slow degrees a little nearer to the stranger, sat \nwith her eyes apparently cast down but glancing sharply at him now \nand then, waiting until he should ask some other question.  She had \nnot to wait long; for he said, presently:\n\n\'And what is the after history of the young lady who went away?  \nThey know it, I suppose?\'\n\nClemency shook her head.  \'I\'ve heard,\' she said, \'that Doctor \nJeddler is thought to know more of it than he tells.  Miss Grace \nhas had letters from her sister, saying that she was well and \nhappy, and made much happier by her being married to Mr. Alfred:  \nand has written letters back.  But there\'s a mystery about her life \nand fortunes, altogether, which nothing has cleared up to this \nhour, and which - \'\n\nShe faltered here, and stopped.\n\n\'And which\' - repeated the stranger.\n\n\'Which only one other person, I believe, could explain,\' said \nClemency, drawing her breath quickly.\n\n\'Who may that be?\' asked the stranger.\n\n\'Mr. Michael Warden!\' answered Clemency, almost in a shriek:  at \nonce conveying to her husband what she would have had him \nunderstand before, and letting Michael Warden know that he was \nrecognised.\n\n\'You remember me, sir?\' said Clemency, trembling with emotion; \'I \nsaw just now you did!  You remember me, that night in the garden.  \nI was with her!\'\n\n\'Yes.  You were,\' he said.\n\n\'Yes, sir,\' returned Clemency.  \'Yes, to be sure.  This is my \nhusband, if you please.  Ben, my dear Ben, run to Miss Grace - run \nto Mr. Alfred - run somewhere, Ben!  Bring somebody here, \ndirectly!\'\n\n\'Stay!\' said Michael Warden, quietly interposing himself between \nthe door and Britain.  \'What would you do?\'\n\n\'Let them know that you are here, sir,\' answered Clemency, clapping \nher hands in sheer agitation.  \'Let them know that they may hear of \nher, from your own lips; let them know that she is not quite lost \nto them, but that she will come home again yet, to bless her father \nand her loving sister - even her old servant, even me,\' she struck \nherself upon the breast with both hands, \'with a sight of her sweet \nface.  Run, Ben, run!\'  And still she pressed him on towards the \ndoor, and still Mr. Warden stood before it, with his hand stretched \nout, not angrily, but sorrowfully.\n\n\'Or perhaps,\' said Clemency, running past her husband, and catching \nin her emotion at Mr. Warden\'s cloak, \'perhaps she\'s here now; \nperhaps she\'s close by.  I think from your manner she is.  Let me \nsee her, sir, if you please.  I waited on her when she was a little \nchild.  I saw her grow to be the pride of all this place.  I knew \nher when she was Mr. Alfred\'s promised wife.  I tried to warn her \nwhen you tempted her away.  I know what her old home was when she \nwas like the soul of it, and how it changed when she was gone and \nlost.  Let me speak to her, if you please!\'\n\nHe gazed at her with compassion, not unmixed with wonder:  but, he \nmade no gesture of assent.\n\n\'I don\'t think she CAN know,\' pursued Clemency, \'how truly they \nforgive her; how they love her; what joy it would be to them, to \nsee her once more.  She may be timorous of going home.  Perhaps if \nshe sees me, it may give her new heart.  Only tell me truly, Mr. \nWarden, is she with you?\'\n\n\'She is not,\' he answered, shaking his head.\n\nThis answer, and his manner, and his black dress, and his coming \nback so quietly, and his announced intention of continuing to live \nabroad, explained it all.  Marion was dead.\n\nHe didn\'t contradict her; yes, she was dead!  Clemency sat down, \nhid her face upon the table, and cried.\n\nAt that moment, a grey-headed old gentleman came running in:  quite \nout of breath, and panting so much that his voice was scarcely to \nbe recognised as the voice of Mr. Snitchey.\n\n\'Good Heaven, Mr. Warden!\' said the lawyer, taking him aside, \'what \nwind has blown - \'  He was so blown himself, that he couldn\'t get \non any further until after a pause, when he added, feebly, \'you \nhere?\'\n\n\'An ill-wind, I am afraid,\' he answered.  \'If you could have heard \nwhat has just passed - how I have been besought and entreated to \nperform impossibilities - what confusion and affliction I carry \nwith me!\'\n\n\'I can guess it all.  But why did you ever come here, my good sir?\' \nretorted Snitchey.\n\n\'Come!  How should I know who kept the house?  When I sent my \nservant on to you, I strolled in here because the place was new to \nme; and I had a natural curiosity in everything new and old, in \nthese old scenes; and it was outside the town.  I wanted to \ncommunicate with you, first, before appearing there.  I wanted to \nknow what people would say to me.  I see by your manner that you \ncan tell me.  If it were not for your confounded caution, I should \nhave been possessed of everything long ago.\'\n\n\'Our caution!\' returned the lawyer, \'speaking for Self and Craggs - \ndeceased,\' here Mr. Snitchey, glancing at his hat-band, shook his \nhead, \'how can you reasonably blame us, Mr. Warden?  It was \nunderstood between us that the subject was never to be renewed, and \nthat it wasn\'t a subject on which grave and sober men like us (I \nmade a note of your observations at the time) could interfere.  Our \ncaution too!  When Mr. Craggs, sir, went down to his respected \ngrave in the full belief - \'\n\n\'I had given a solemn promise of silence until I should return, \nwhenever that might be,\' interrupted Mr. Warden; \'and I have kept \nit.\'\n\n\'Well, sir, and I repeat it,\' returned Mr. Snitchey, \'we were bound \nto silence too.  We were bound to silence in our duty towards \nourselves, and in our duty towards a variety of clients, you among \nthem, who were as close as wax.  It was not our place to make \ninquiries of you on such a delicate subject.  I had my suspicions, \nsir; but, it is not six months since I have known the truth, and \nbeen assured that you lost her.\'\n\n\'By whom?\' inquired his client.\n\n\'By Doctor Jeddler himself, sir, who at last reposed that \nconfidence in me voluntarily.  He, and only he, has known the whole \ntruth, years and years.\'\n\n\'And you know it?\' said his client.\n\n\'I do, sir!\' replied Snitchey; \'and I have also reason to know that \nit will be broken to her sister to-morrow evening.  They have given \nher that promise.  In the meantime, perhaps you\'ll give me the \nhonour of your company at my house; being unexpected at your own.  \nBut, not to run the chance of any more such difficulties as you \nhave had here, in case you should be recognised - though you\'re a \ngood deal changed; I think I might have passed you myself, Mr. \nWarden - we had better dine here, and walk on in the evening.  It\'s \na very good place to dine at, Mr. Warden:  your own property, by-\nthe-bye.  Self and Craggs (deceased) took a chop here sometimes, \nand had it very comfortably served.  Mr. Craggs, sir,\' said \nSnitchey, shutting his eyes tight for an instant, and opening them \nagain, \'was struck off the roll of life too soon.\'\n\n\'Heaven forgive me for not condoling with you,\' returned Michael \nWarden, passing his hand across his forehead, \'but I\'m like a man \nin a dream at present.  I seem to want my wits.  Mr. Craggs - yes - \nI am very sorry we have lost Mr. Craggs.\'  But he looked at \nClemency as he said it, and seemed to sympathise with Ben, \nconsoling her.\n\n\'Mr. Craggs, sir,\' observed Snitchey, \'didn\'t find life, I regret \nto say, as easy to have and to hold as his theory made it out, or \nhe would have been among us now.  It\'s a great loss to me.  He was \nmy right arm, my right leg, my right ear, my right eye, was Mr. \nCraggs.  I am paralytic without him.  He bequeathed his share of \nthe business to Mrs. Craggs, her executors, administrators, and \nassigns.  His name remains in the Firm to this hour.  I try, in a \nchildish sort of a way, to make believe, sometimes, he\'s alive.  \nYou may observe that I speak for Self and Craggs - deceased, sir - \ndeceased,\' said the tender-hearted attorney, waving his pocket-\nhandkerchief.\n\nMichael Warden, who had still been observant of Clemency, turned to \nMr. Snitchey when he ceased to speak, and whispered in his ear.\n\n\'Ah, poor thing!\' said Snitchey, shaking his head.  \'Yes.  She was \nalways very faithful to Marion.  She was always very fond of her.  \nPretty Marion!  Poor Marion!  Cheer up, Mistress - you are married \nnow, you know, Clemency.\'\n\nClemency only sighed, and shook her head.\n\n\'Well, well!  Wait till to-morrow,\' said the lawyer, kindly.\n\n\'To-morrow can\'t bring back\' the dead to life, Mister,\' said \nClemency, sobbing.\n\n\'No.  It can\'t do that, or it would bring back Mr. Craggs, \ndeceased,\' returned the lawyer.  \'But it may bring some soothing \ncircumstances; it may bring some comfort.  Wait till to-morrow!\'\n\nSo Clemency, shaking his proffered hand, said she would; and \nBritain, who had been terribly cast down at sight of his despondent \nwife (which was like the business hanging its head), said that was \nright; and Mr. Snitchey and Michael Warden went up-stairs; and \nthere they were soon engaged in a conversation so cautiously \nconducted, that no murmur of it was audible above the clatter of \nplates and dishes, the hissing of the frying-pan, the bubbling of \nsaucepans, the low monotonous waltzing of the jack - with a \ndreadful click every now and then as if it had met with some mortal \naccident to its head, in a fit of giddiness - and all the other \npreparations in the kitchen for their dinner.\n\n\nTo-morrow was a bright and peaceful day; and nowhere were the \nautumn tints more beautifully seen, than from the quiet orchard of \nthe Doctor\'s house.  The snows of many winter nights had melted \nfrom that ground, the withered leaves of many summer times had \nrustled there, since she had fled.  The honey-suckle porch was \ngreen again, the trees cast bountiful and changing shadows on the \ngrass, the landscape was as tranquil and serene as it had ever \nbeen; but where was she!\n\nNot there.  Not there.  She would have been a stranger sight in her \nold home now, even than that home had been at first, without her.  \nBut, a lady sat in the familiar place, from whose heart she had \nnever passed away; in whose true memory she lived, unchanging, \nyouthful, radiant with all promise and all hope; in whose affection \n- and it was a mother\'s now, there was a cherished little daughter \nplaying by her side - she had no rival, no successor; upon whose \ngentle lips her name was trembling then.\n\nThe spirit of the lost girl looked out of those eyes.  Those eyes \nof Grace, her sister, sitting with her husband in the orchard, on \ntheir wedding-day, and his and Marion\'s birth-day.\n\nHe had not become a great man; he had not grown rich; he had not \nforgotten the scenes and friends of his youth; he had not fulfilled \nany one of the Doctor\'s old predictions.  But, in his useful, \npatient, unknown visiting of poor men\'s homes; and in his watching \nof sick beds; and in his daily knowledge of the gentleness and \ngoodness flowering the by-paths of this world, not to be trodden \ndown beneath the heavy foot of poverty, but springing up, elastic, \nin its track, and making its way beautiful; he had better learned \nand proved, in each succeeding year, the truth of his old faith.  \nThe manner of his life, though quiet and remote, had shown him how \noften men still entertained angels, unawares, as in the olden time; \nand how the most unlikely forms - even some that were mean and ugly \nto the view, and poorly clad - became irradiated by the couch of \nsorrow, want, and pain, and changed to ministering spirits with a \nglory round their heads.\n\nHe lived to better purpose on the altered battle-ground, perhaps, \nthan if he had contended restlessly in more ambitious lists; and he \nwas happy with his wife, dear Grace.\n\nAnd Marion.  Had HE forgotten her?\n\n\'The time has flown, dear Grace,\' he said, \'since then;\' they had \nbeen talking of that night; \'and yet it seems a long long while \nago.  We count by changes and events within us.  Not by years.\'\n\n\'Yet we have years to count by, too, since Marion was with us,\' \nreturned Grace.  \'Six times, dear husband, counting to-night as \none, we have sat here on her birth-day, and spoken together of that \nhappy return, so eagerly expected and so long deferred.  Ah when \nwill it be!  When will it be!\'\n\nHer husband attentively observed her, as the tears collected in her \neyes; and drawing nearer, said:\n\n\'But, Marion told you, in that farewell letter which she left for \nyou upon your table, love, and which you read so often, that years \nmust pass away before it COULD be.  Did she not?\'\n\nShe took a letter from her breast, and kissed it, and said \'Yes.\'\n\n\'That through these intervening years, however happy she might be, \nshe would look forward to the time when you would meet again, and \nall would be made clear; and that she prayed you, trustfully and \nhopefully to do the same.  The letter runs so, does it not, my \ndear?\'\n\n\'Yes, Alfred.\'\n\n\'And every other letter she has written since?\'\n\n\'Except the last - some months ago - in which she spoke of you, and \nwhat you then knew, and what I was to learn to-night.\'\n\nHe looked towards the sun, then fast declining, and said that the \nappointed time was sunset.\n\n\'Alfred!\' said Grace, laying her hand upon his shoulder earnestly, \n\'there is something in this letter - this old letter, which you say \nI read so often - that I have never told you.  But, to-night, dear \nhusband, with that sunset drawing near, and all our life seeming to \nsoften and become hushed with the departing day, I cannot keep it \nsecret.\'\n\n\'What is it, love?\'\n\n\'When Marion went away, she wrote me, here, that you had once left \nher a sacred trust to me, and that now she left you, Alfred, such a \ntrust in my hands:  praying and beseeching me, as I loved her, and \nas I loved you, not to reject the affection she believed (she knew, \nshe said) you would transfer to me when the new wound was healed, \nbut to encourage and return it.\'\n\n\' - And make me a proud, and happy man again, Grace.  Did she say \nso?\'\n\n\'She meant, to make myself so blest and honoured in your love,\' was \nhis wife\'s answer, as he held her in his arms.\n\n\'Hear me, my dear!\' he said. - \'No.  Hear me so!\' - and as he \nspoke, he gently laid the head she had raised, again upon his \nshoulder.  \'I know why I have never heard this passage in the \nletter, until now.  I know why no trace of it ever showed itself in \nany word or look of yours at that time.  I know why Grace, although \nso true a friend to me, was hard to win to be my wife.  And knowing \nit, my own! I know the priceless value of the heart I gird within \nmy arms, and thank GOD for the rich possession!\'\n\nShe wept, but not for sorrow, as he pressed her to his heart.  \nAfter a brief space, he looked down at the child, who was sitting \nat their feet playing with a little basket of flowers, and bade her \nlook how golden and how red the sun was.\n\n\'Alfred,\' said Grace, raising her head quickly at these words.  \n\'The sun is going down.  You have not forgotten what I am to know \nbefore it sets.\'\n\n\'You are to know the truth of Marion\'s history, my love,\' he \nanswered.\n\n\'All the truth,\' she said, imploringly.  \'Nothing veiled from me, \nany more.  That was the promise.  Was it not?\'\n\n\'It was,\' he answered.\n\n\'Before the sun went down on Marion\'s birth-day.  And you see it, \nAlfred?  It is sinking fast.\'\n\nHe put his arm about her waist, and, looking steadily into her \neyes, rejoined:\n\n\'That truth is not reserved so long for me to tell, dear Grace.  It \nis to come from other lips.\'\n\n\'From other lips!\' she faintly echoed.\n\n\'Yes.  I know your constant heart, I know how brave you are, I know \nthat to you a word of preparation is enough.  You have said, truly, \nthat the time is come.  It is.  Tell me that you have present \nfortitude to bear a trial - a surprise - a shock:  and the \nmessenger is waiting at the gate.\'\n\n\'What messenger?\' she said.  \'And what intelligence does he bring?\'\n\n\'I am pledged,\' he answered her, preserving his steady look, \'to \nsay no more.  Do you think you understand me?\'\n\n\'I am afraid to think,\' she said.\n\nThere was that emotion in his face, despite its steady gaze, which \nfrightened her.  Again she hid her own face on his shoulder, \ntrembling, and entreated him to pause - a moment.\n\n\'Courage, my wife!  When you have firmness to receive the \nmessenger, the messenger is waiting at the gate.  The sun is \nsetting on Marion\'s birth-day.  Courage, courage, Grace!\'\n\nShe raised her head, and, looking at him, told him she was ready.  \nAs she stood, and looked upon him going away, her face was so like \nMarion\'s as it had been in her later days at home, that it was \nwonderful to see.  He took the child with him.  She called her back \n- she bore the lost girl\'s name - and pressed her to her bosom.  \nThe little creature, being released again, sped after him, and \nGrace was left alone.\n\nShe knew not what she dreaded, or what hoped; but remained there, \nmotionless, looking at the porch by which they had disappeared.\n\nAh! what was that, emerging from its shadow; standing on its \nthreshold!  That figure, with its white garments rustling in the \nevening air; its head laid down upon her father\'s breast, and \npressed against it to his loving heart!  O God! was it a vision \nthat came bursting from the old man\'s arms, and with a cry, and \nwith a waving of its hands, and with a wild precipitation of itself \nupon her in its boundless love, sank down in her embrace!\n\n\'Oh, Marion, Marion!  Oh, my sister!  Oh, my heart\'s dear love!  \nOh, joy and happiness unutterable, so to meet again!\'\n\nIt was no dream, no phantom conjured up by hope and fear, but \nMarion, sweet Marion!  So beautiful, so happy, so unalloyed by care \nand trial, so elevated and exalted in her loveliness, that as the \nsetting sun shone brightly on her upturned face, she might have \nbeen a spirit visiting the earth upon some healing mission.\n\nClinging to her sister, who had dropped upon a seat and bent down \nover her - and smiling through her tears - and kneeling, close \nbefore her, with both arms twining round her, and never turning for \nan instant from her face - and with the glory of the setting sun \nupon her brow, and with the soft tranquillity of evening gathering \naround them - Marion at length broke silence; her voice, so calm, \nlow, clear, and pleasant, well-tuned to the time.\n\n\'When this was my dear home, Grace, as it will be now again - \'\n\n\'Stay, my sweet love!  A moment!  O Marion, to hear you speak \nagain.\'\n\nShe could not bear the voice she loved so well, at first.\n\n\'When this was my dear home, Grace, as it will be now again, I \nloved him from my soul.  I loved him most devotedly.  I would have \ndied for him, though I was so young.  I never slighted his \naffection in my secret breast for one brief instant.  It was far \nbeyond all price to me.  Although it is so long ago, and past, and \ngone, and everything is wholly changed, I could not bear to think \nthat you, who love so well, should think I did not truly love him \nonce.  I never loved him better, Grace, than when he left this very \nscene upon this very day.  I never loved him better, dear one, than \nI did that night when I left here.\'\n\nHer sister, bending over her, could look into her face, and hold \nher fast.\n\n\'But he had gained, unconsciously,\' said Marion, with a gentle \nsmile, \'another heart, before I knew that I had one to give him.  \nThat heart - yours, my sister! - was so yielded up, in all its \nother tenderness, to me; was so devoted, and so noble; that it \nplucked its love away, and kept its secret from all eyes but mine - \nAh! what other eyes were quickened by such tenderness and \ngratitude! - and was content to sacrifice itself to me.  But, I \nknew something of its depths.  I knew the struggle it had made.  I \nknew its high, inestimable worth to him, and his appreciation of \nit, let him love me as he would.  I knew the debt I owed it.  I had \nits great example every day before me.  What you had done for me, I \nknew that I could do, Grace, if I would, for you.  I never laid my \nhead down on my pillow, but I prayed with tears to do it.  I never \nlaid my head down on my pillow, but I thought of Alfred\'s own words \non the day of his departure, and how truly he had said (for I knew \nthat, knowing you) that there were victories gained every day, in \nstruggling hearts, to which these fields of battle were nothing.  \nThinking more and more upon the great endurance cheerfully \nsustained, and never known or cared for, that there must be, every \nday and hour, in that great strife of which he spoke, my trial \nseemed to grow light and easy.  And He who knows our hearts, my \ndearest, at this moment, and who knows there is no drop of \nbitterness or grief - of anything but unmixed happiness - in mine, \nenabled me to make the resolution that I never would be Alfred\'s \nwife.  That he should be my brother, and your husband, if the \ncourse I took could bring that happy end to pass; but that I never \nwould (Grace, I then loved him dearly, dearly!) be his wife!\'\n\n\'O Marion!  O Marion!\'\n\n\'I had tried to seem indifferent to him;\' and she pressed her \nsister\'s face against her own; \'but that was hard, and you were \nalways his true advocate.  I had tried to tell you of my \nresolution, but you would never hear me; you would never understand \nme.  The time was drawing near for his return.  I felt that I must \nact, before the daily intercourse between us was renewed.  I knew \nthat one great pang, undergone at that time, would save a \nlengthened agony to all of us.  I knew that if I went away then, \nthat end must follow which HAS followed, and which has made us both \nso happy, Grace!  I wrote to good Aunt Martha, for a refuge in her \nhouse:  I did not then tell her all, but something of my story, and \nshe freely promised it.  While I was contesting that step with \nmyself, and with my love of you, and home, Mr. Warden, brought here \nby an accident, became, for some time, our companion.\'\n\n\'I have sometimes feared of late years, that this might have been,\' \nexclaimed her sister; and her countenance was ashy-pale.  \'You \nnever loved him - and you married him in your self-sacrifice to \nme!\'\n\n\'He was then,\' said Marion, drawing her sister closer to her, \'on \nthe eve of going secretly away for a long time.  He wrote to me, \nafter leaving here; told me what his condition and prospects really \nwere; and offered me his hand.  He told me he had seen I was not \nhappy in the prospect of Alfred\'s return.  I believe he thought my \nheart had no part in that contract; perhaps thought I might have \nloved him once, and did not then; perhaps thought that when I tried \nto seem indifferent, I tried to hide indifference - I cannot tell.  \nBut I wished that you should feel me wholly lost to Alfred - \nhopeless to him - dead.  Do you understand me, love?\'\n\nHer sister looked into her face, attentively.  She seemed in doubt.\n\n\'I saw Mr. Warden, and confided in his honour; charged him with my \nsecret, on the eve of his and my departure.  He kept it.  Do you \nunderstand me, dear?\'\n\nGrace looked confusedly upon her.  She scarcely seemed to hear.\n\n\'My love, my sister!\' said Marion, \'recall your thoughts a moment; \nlisten to me.  Do not look so strangely on me.  There are \ncountries, dearest, where those who would abjure a misplaced \npassion, or would strive, against some cherished feeling of their \nhearts and conquer it, retire into a hopeless solitude, and close \nthe world against themselves and worldly loves and hopes for ever.  \nWhen women do so, they assume that name which is so dear to you and \nme, and call each other Sisters.  But, there may be sisters, Grace, \nwho, in the broad world out of doors, and underneath its free sky, \nand in its crowded places, and among its busy life, and trying to \nassist and cheer it and to do some good, - learn the same lesson; \nand who, with hearts still fresh and young, and open to all \nhappiness and means of happiness, can say the battle is long past, \nthe victory long won.  And such a one am I!  You understand me \nnow?\'\n\nStill she looked fixedly upon her, and made no reply.\n\n\'Oh Grace, dear Grace,\' said Marion, clinging yet more tenderly and \nfondly to that breast from which she had been so long exiled, \'if \nyou were not a happy wife and mother - if I had no little namesake \nhere - if Alfred, my kind brother, were not your own fond husband - \nfrom whence could I derive the ecstasy I feel to-night!  But, as I \nleft here, so I have returned.  My heart has known no other love, \nmy hand has never been bestowed apart from it.  I am still your \nmaiden sister, unmarried, unbetrothed:  your own loving old Marion, \nin whose affection you exist alone and have no partner, Grace!\'\n\nShe understood her now.  Her face relaxed:  sobs came to her \nrelief; and falling on her neck, she wept and wept, and fondled her \nas if she were a child again.\n\nWhen they were more composed, they found that the Doctor, and his \nsister good Aunt Martha, were standing near at hand, with Alfred.\n\n\'This is a weary day for me,\' said good Aunt Martha, smiling \nthrough her tears, as she embraced her nieces; \'for I lose my dear \ncompanion in making you all happy; and what can you give me, in \nreturn for my Marion?\'\n\n\'A converted brother,\' said the Doctor.\n\n\'That\'s something, to be sure,\' retorted Aunt Martha, \'in such a \nfarce as - \'\n\n\'No, pray don\'t,\' said the doctor penitently.\n\n\'Well, I won\'t,\' replied Aunt Martha.  \'But, I consider myself ill \nused.  I don\'t know what\'s to become of me without my Marion, after \nwe have lived together half-a-dozen years.\'\n\n\'You must come and live here, I suppose,\' replied the Doctor.  \'We \nshan\'t quarrel now, Martha.\'\n\n\'Or you must get married, Aunt,\' said Alfred.\n\n\'Indeed,\' returned the old lady, \'I think it might be a good \nspeculation if I were to set my cap at Michael Warden, who, I hear, \nis come home much the better for his absence in all respects.  But \nas I knew him when he was a boy, and I was not a very young woman \nthen, perhaps he mightn\'t respond.  So I\'ll make up my mind to go \nand live with Marion, when she marries, and until then (it will not \nbe very long, I dare say) to live alone.  What do YOU say, \nBrother?\'\n\n\'I\'ve a great mind to say it\'s a ridiculous world altogether, and \nthere\'s nothing serious in it,\' observed the poor old Doctor.\n\n\'You might take twenty affidavits of it if you chose, Anthony,\' \nsaid his sister; \'but nobody would believe you with such eyes as \nthose.\'\n\n\'It\'s a world full of hearts,\' said the Doctor, hugging his \nyoungest daughter, and bending across her to hug Grace - for he \ncouldn\'t separate the sisters; \'and a serious world, with all its \nfolly - even with mine, which was enough to have swamped the whole \nglobe; and it is a world on which the sun never rises, but it looks \nupon a thousand bloodless battles that are some set-off against the \nmiseries and wickedness of Battle-Fields; and it is a world we need \nbe careful how we libel, Heaven forgive us, for it is a world of \nsacred mysteries, and its Creator only knows what lies beneath the \nsurface of His lightest image!\'\n\n\nYou would not be the better pleased with my rude pen, if it \ndissected and laid open to your view the transports of this family, \nlong severed and now reunited.  Therefore, I will not follow the \npoor Doctor through his humbled recollection of the sorrow he had \nhad, when Marion was lost to him; nor, will I tell how serious he \nhad found that world to be, in which some love, deep-anchored, is \nthe portion of all human creatures; nor, how such a trifle as the \nabsence of one little unit in the great absurd account, had \nstricken him to the ground.  Nor, how, in compassion for his \ndistress, his sister had, long ago, revealed the truth to him by \nslow degrees, and brought him to the knowledge of the heart of his \nself-banished daughter, and to that daughter\'s side.\n\nNor, how Alfred Heathfield had been told the truth, too, in the \ncourse of that then current year; and Marion had seen him, and had \npromised him, as her brother, that on her birth-day, in the \nevening, Grace should know it from her lips at last.\n\n\'I beg your pardon, Doctor,\' said Mr. Snitchey, looking into the \norchard, \'but have I liberty to come in?\'\n\nWithout waiting for permission, he came straight to Marion, and \nkissed her hand, quite joyfully.\n\n\'If Mr. Craggs had been alive, my dear Miss Marion,\' said Mr. \nSnitchey, \'he would have had great interest in this occasion.  It \nmight have suggested to him, Mr. Alfred, that our life is not too \neasy perhaps:  that, taken altogether, it will bear any little \nsmoothing we can give it; but Mr. Craggs was a man who could endure \nto be convinced, sir.  He was always open to conviction.  If he \nwere open to conviction, now, I - this is weakness.  Mrs. Snitchey, \nmy dear,\' - at his summons that lady appeared from behind the door, \n\'you are among old friends.\'\n\nMrs. Snitchey having delivered her congratulations, took her \nhusband aside.\n\n\'One moment, Mr. Snitchey,\' said that lady.  \'It is not in my \nnature to rake up the ashes of the departed.\'\n\n\'No, my dear,\' returned her husband.\n\n\'Mr. Craggs is - \'\n\n\'Yes, my dear, he is deceased,\' said Snitchey.\n\n\'But I ask you if you recollect,\' pursued his wife, \'that evening \nof the ball?  I only ask you that.  If you do; and if your memory \nhas not entirely failed you, Mr. Snitchey; and if you are not \nabsolutely in your dotage; I ask you to connect this time with that \n- to remember how I begged and prayed you, on my knees - \'\n\n\'Upon your knees, my dear?\' said Mr. Snitchey.\n\n\'Yes,\' said Mrs. Snitchey, confidently, \'and you know it - to \nbeware of that man - to observe his eye - and now to tell me \nwhether I was right, and whether at that moment he knew secrets \nwhich he didn\'t choose to tell.\'\n\n\'Mrs. Snitchey,\' returned her husband, in her ear, \'Madam.  Did you \never observe anything in MY eye?\'\n\n\'No,\' said Mrs. Snitchey, sharply.  \'Don\'t flatter yourself.\'\n\n\'Because, Madam, that night,\' he continued, twitching her by the \nsleeve, \'it happens that we both knew secrets which we didn\'t \nchoose to tell, and both knew just the same professionally.  And so \nthe less you say about such things the better, Mrs. Snitchey; and \ntake this as a warning to have wiser and more charitable eyes \nanother time.  Miss Marion, I brought a friend of yours along with \nme.  Here!  Mistress!\'\n\nPoor Clemency, with her apron to her eyes, came slowly in, escorted \nby her husband; the latter doleful with the presentiment, that if \nshe abandoned herself to grief, the Nutmeg-Grater was done for.\n\n\'Now, Mistress,\' said the lawyer, checking Marion as she ran \ntowards her, and interposing himself between them, \'what\'s the \nmatter with YOU?\'\n\n\'The matter!\' cried poor Clemency. - When, looking up in wonder, \nand in indignant remonstrance, and in the added emotion of a great \nroar from Mr. Britain, and seeing that sweet face so well \nremembered close before her, she stared, sobbed, laughed, cried, \nscreamed, embraced her, held her fast, released her, fell on Mr. \nSnitchey and embraced him (much to Mrs. Snitchey\'s indignation), \nfell on the Doctor and embraced him, fell on Mr. Britain and \nembraced him, and concluded by embracing herself, throwing her \napron over her head, and going into hysterics behind it.\n\nA stranger had come into the orchard, after Mr. Snitchey, and had \nremained apart, near the gate, without being observed by any of the \ngroup; for they had little spare attention to bestow, and that had \nbeen monopolised by the ecstasies of Clemency.  He did not appear \nto wish to be observed, but stood alone, with downcast eyes; and \nthere was an air of dejection about him (though he was a gentleman \nof a gallant appearance) which the general happiness rendered more \nremarkable.\n\nNone but the quick eyes of Aunt Martha, however, remarked him at \nall; but, almost as soon as she espied him, she was in conversation \nwith him.  Presently, going to where Marion stood with Grace and \nher little namesake, she whispered something in Marion\'s ear, at \nwhich she started, and appeared surprised; but soon recovering from \nher confusion, she timidly approached the stranger, in Aunt \nMartha\'s company, and engaged in conversation with him too.\n\n\'Mr. Britain,\' said the lawyer, putting his hand in his pocket, and \nbringing out a legal-looking document, while this was going on, \'I \ncongratulate you.  You are now the whole and sole proprietor of \nthat freehold tenement, at present occupied and held by yourself as \na licensed tavern, or house of public entertainment, and commonly \ncalled or known by the sign of the Nutmeg-Grater.  Your wife lost \none house, through my client Mr. Michael Warden; and now gains \nanother.  I shall have the pleasure of canvassing you for the \ncounty, one of these fine mornings.\'\n\n\'Would it make any difference in the vote if the sign was altered, \nsir?\' asked Britain.\n\n\'Not in the least,\' replied the lawyer.\n\n\'Then,\' said Mr. Britain, handing him back the conveyance, \'just \nclap in the words, \"and Thimble,\" will you be so good; and I\'ll \nhave the two mottoes painted up in the parlour instead of my wife\'s \nportrait.\'\n\n\'And let me,\' said a voice behind them; it was the stranger\'s - \nMichael Warden\'s; \'let me claim the benefit of those inscriptions.  \nMr. Heathfield and Dr. Jeddler, I might have deeply wronged you \nboth.  That I did not, is no virtue of my own.  I will not say that \nI am six years wiser than I was, or better.  But I have known, at \nany rate, that term of self-reproach.  I can urge no reason why you \nshould deal gently with me.  I abused the hospitality of this \nhouse; and learnt by my own demerits, with a shame I never have \nforgotten, yet with some profit too, I would fain hope, from one,\' \nhe glanced at Marion, \'to whom I made my humble supplication for \nforgiveness, when I knew her merit and my deep unworthiness.  In a \nfew days I shall quit this place for ever.  I entreat your pardon.  \nDo as you would be done by!  Forget and Forgive!\'\n\n\nTIME - from whom I had the latter portion of this story, and with \nwhom I have the pleasure of a personal acquaintance of some five-\nand-thirty years\' duration - informed me, leaning easily upon his \nscythe, that Michael Warden never went away again, and never sold \nhis house, but opened it afresh, maintained a golden means of \nhospitality, and had a wife, the pride and honour of that \ncountryside, whose name was Marion.  But, as I have observed that \nTime confuses facts occasionally, I hardly know what weight to give \nto his authority.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg Etext of The Battle of Life by Charles Dickens\n\n*The Project Gutenberg Etext of Bleak House by Charles Dickens*\n#33 in our series by Charles Dickens\n\n\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check\nthe copyright laws for your country before posting these files!!\n\nPlease take a look at the important information in this header.\nWe encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an\nelectronic path open for the next readers.

FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS*Ver.04.29.93*END*\n\n\n\n\n\nThis etext was prepared by Donald Lainson, Toronto, Canada\n(charlie@idirect.com)\n\n\n\n\n\nBLEAK HOUSE\n\nby Charles Dickens\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nA Chancery judge once had the kindness to inform me, as one of a \ncompany of some hundred and fifty men and women not labouring under \nany suspicions of lunacy, that the Court of Chancery, though the \nshining subject of much popular prejudice (at which point I thought \nthe judge\'s eye had a cast in my direction), was almost immaculate.  \nThere had been, he admitted, a trivial blemish or so in its rate of \nprogress, but this was exaggerated and had been entirely owing to \nthe \"parsimony of the public,\" which guilty public, it appeared, \nhad been until lately bent in the most determined manner on by no \nmeans enlarging the number of Chancery judges appointed--I believe \nby Richard the Second, but any other king will do as well.\n\nThis seemed to me too profound a joke to be inserted in the body of \nthis book or I should have restored it to Conversation Kenge or to \nMr. Vholes, with one or other of whom I think it must have \noriginated.  In such mouths I might have coupled it with an apt \nquotation from one of Shakespeare\'s sonnets:\n\n\"My nature is subdued\nTo what it works in, like the dyer\'s hand:\nPity me, then, and wish I were renewed!\"\n\nBut as it is wholesome that the parsimonious public should know \nwhat has been doing, and still is doing, in this connexion, I \nmention here that everything set forth in these pages concerning \nthe Court of Chancery is substantially true, and within the truth.  \nThe case of Gridley is in no essential altered from one of actual \noccurrence, made public by a disinterested person who was \nprofessionally acquainted with the whole of the monstrous wrong \nfrom beginning to end.  At the present moment (August, 1853) there \nis a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years \nago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to \nappear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount \nof seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is \n(I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was \nbegun.  There is another well-known suit in Chancery, not yet \ndecided, which was commenced before the close of the last century \nand in which more than double the amount of seventy thousand pounds \nhas been swallowed up in costs.  If I wanted other authorities for \nJarndyce and Jarndyce, I could rain them on these pages, to the \nshame of--a parsimonious public.\n\nThere is only one other point on which I offer a word of remark.  \nThe possibility of what is called spontaneous combustion has been \ndenied since the death of Mr. Krook; and my good friend Mr. Lewes \n(quite mistaken, as he soon found, in supposing the thing to have \nbeen abandoned by all authorities) published some ingenious letters \nto me at the time when that event was chronicled, arguing that \nspontaneous combustion could not possibly be.  I have no need to \nobserve that I do not wilfully or negligently mislead my readers \nand that before I wrote that description I took pains to \ninvestigate the subject.  There are about thirty cases on record, \nof which the most famous, that of the Countess Cornelia de Baudi \nCesenate, was minutely investigated and described by Giuseppe \nBianchini, a prebendary of Verona, otherwise distinguished in \nletters, who published an account of it at Verona in 1731, which he \nafterwards republished at Rome.  The appearances, beyond all \nrational doubt, observed in that case are the appearances observed \nin Mr. Krook\'s case.  The next most famous instance happened at \nRheims six years earlier, and the historian in that case is Le Cat, \none of the most renowned surgeons produced by France.  The subject \nwas a woman, whose husband was ignorantly convicted of having \nmurdered her; but on solemn appeal to a higher court, he was \nacquitted because it was shown upon the evidence that she had died \nthe death of which this name of spontaneous combustion is given.  I \ndo not think it necessary to add to these notable facts, and that \ngeneral reference to the authorities which will be found at page \n30, vol. ii.,* the recorded opinions and experiences of \ndistinguished medical professors, French, English, and Scotch, in \nmore modern days, contenting myself with observing that I shall not \nabandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable \nspontaneous combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences \nare usually received.\n\nIn Bleak House I have purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of \nfamiliar things.\n\n\n1853\n\n\n* Another case, very clearly described by a dentist, occurred at \nthe town of Columbus, in the United States of America, quite \nrecently.  The subject was a German who kept a liquor-shop aud was \nan inveterate drunkard.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIn Chancery\n\n\nLondon.  Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor \nsitting in Lincoln\'s Inn Hall.  Implacable November weather.  As \nmuch mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from \nthe face of the earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a \nMegalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine \nlizard up Holborn Hill.  Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, \nmaking a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as \nfull-grown snowflakes--gone into mourning, one might imagine, for \nthe death of the sun.  Dogs, undistinguishable in mire.  Horses, \nscarcely better; splashed to their very blinkers.  Foot passengers, \njostling one another\'s umbrellas in a general infection of ill \ntemper, and losing their foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of \nthousands of other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding \nsince the day broke (if this day ever broke), adding new deposits \nto the crust upon crust of mud, sticking at those points \ntenaciously to the pavement, and accumulating at compound interest.\n\nFog everywhere.  Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits \nand meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls deified among the \ntiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and \ndirty) city.  Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights.  \nFog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on \nthe yards and hovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping \non the gunwales of barges and small boats.  Fog in the eyes and \nthroats of ancient Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides \nof their wards; fog in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of \nthe wrathful skipper, down in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching \nthe toes and fingers of his shivering little \'prentice boy on deck.  \nChance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a \nnether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a \nballoon and hanging in the misty clouds.\n\nGas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much \nas the sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by \nhusbandman and ploughboy.  Most of the shops lighted two hours \nbefore their time--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard \nand unwilling look.\n\nThe raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the \nmuddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction, \nappropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old \ncorporation, Temple Bar.  And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln\'s Inn \nHall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor \nin his High Court of Chancery.\n\nNever can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and \nmire too deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition \nwhich this High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, \nholds this day in the sight of heaven and earth.\n\nOn such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be \nsitting her--as here he is--with a foggy glory round his head, \nsoftly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a \nlarge advocate with great whiskers, a little voice, and an \ninterminable brief, and outwardly directing his contemplation to \nthe lantern in the roof, where he can see nothing but fog.  On such \nan afternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery \nbar ought to be--as here they are--mistily engaged in one of the \nten thousand stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on \nslippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running \ntheir goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words \nand making a pretence of equity with serious faces, as players \nmight.  On such an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause, \nsome two or three of whom have inherited it from their fathers, who \nmade a fortune by it, ought to be--as are they not?--ranged in a \nline, in a long matted well (but you might look in vain for truth \nat the bottom of it) between the registrar\'s red table and the silk \ngowns, with bills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders, injunctions, \naffidavits, issues, references to masters, masters\' reports, \nmountains of costly nonsense, piled before them.  Well may the \ncourt be dim, with wasting candles here and there; well may the fog \nhang heavy in it, as if it would never get out; well may the \nstained-glass windows lose their colour and admit no light of day \ninto the place; well may the uninitiated from the streets, who peep \nin through the glass panes in the door, be deterred from entrance \nby its owlish aspect and by the drawl, languidly echoing to the \nroof from the padded dais where the Lord High Chancellor looks into \nthe lantern that has no light in it and where the attendant wigs \nare all stuck in a fog-bank!  This is the Court of Chancery, which \nhas its decaying houses and its blighted lands in every shire, \nwhich has its worn-out lunatic in every madhouse and its dead in \nevery churchyard, which has its ruined suitor with his slipshod \nheels and threadbare dress borrowing and begging through the round \nof every man\'s acquaintance, which gives to monied might the means \nabundantly of wearying out the right, which so exhausts finances, \npatience, courage, hope, so overthrows the brain and breaks the \nheart, that there is not an honourable man among its practitioners \nwho would not give--who does not often give--the warning, \"Suffer \nany wrong that can be done you rather than come here!\"\n\nWho happen to be in the Lord Chancellor\'s court this murky \nafternoon besides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, \ntwo or three counsel who are never in any cause, and the well of \nsolicitors before mentioned?  There is the registrar below the \njudge, in wig and gown; and there are two or three maces, or petty-\nbags, or privy purses, or whatever they may be, in legal court \nsuits.  These are all yawning, for no crumb of amusement ever falls \nfrom Jarndyce and Jarndyce (the cause in hand), which was squeezed \ndry years upon years ago.  The short-hand writers, the reporters of \nthe court, and the reporters of the newspapers invariably decamp \nwith the rest of the regulars when Jarndyce and Jarndyce comes on.  \nTheir places are a blank.  Standing on a seat at the side of the \nhall, the better to peer into the curtained sanctuary, is a little \nmad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is always in court, from its \nsitting to its rising, and always expecting some incomprehensible \njudgment to be given in her favour.  Some say she really is, or \nwas, a party to a suit, but no one knows for certain because no one \ncares.  She carries some small litter in a reticule which she calls \nher documents, principally consisting of paper matches and dry \nlavender.  A sallow prisoner has come up, in custody, for the half-\ndozenth time to make a personal application \"to purge himself of \nhis contempt,\" which, being a solitary surviving executor who has \nfallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts of which it is \nnot pretended that he had ever any knowledge, he is not at all \nlikely ever to do.  In the meantime his prospects in life are \nended.  Another ruined suitor, who periodically appears from \nShropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at \nthe close of the day\'s business and who can by no means be made to \nunderstand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence \nafter making it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself \nin a good place and keeps an eye on the judge, ready to call out \n\"My Lord!\" in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his \nrising.  A few lawyers\' clerks and others who know this suitor by \nsight linger on the chance of his furnishing some fun and \nenlivening the dismal weather a little.\n\nJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on.  This scarecrow of a suit has, in \ncourse of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what \nit means.  The parties to it understand it least, but it has been \nobserved that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five \nminutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the \npremises.  Innumerable children have been born into the cause; \ninnumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old \npeople have died out of it.  Scores of persons have deliriously \nfound themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without \nknowing how or why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds \nwith the suit.  The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised \na new rocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled \nhas grown up, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away \ninto the other world.  Fair wards of court have faded into mothers \nand grandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and \ngone out; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed \ninto mere bills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left \nupon the earth perhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his \nbrains out at a coffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and \nJarndyce still drags its dreary length before the court, \nperennially hopeless.\n\nJarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke.  That is the only \ngood that has ever come of it.  It has been death to many, but it \nis a joke in the profession.  Every master in Chancery has had a \nreference out of it.  Every Chancellor was \"in it,\" for somebody or \nother, when he was counsel at the bar.  Good things have been said \nabout it by blue-nosed, bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port-\nwine committee after dinner in hall.  Articled clerks have been in \nthe habit of fleshing their legal wit upon it.  The last Lord \nChancellor handled it neatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers, the \neminent silk gown who said that such a thing might happen when the \nsky rained potatoes, he observed, \"or when we get through Jarndyce \nand Jarndyce, Mr. Blowers\"--a pleasantry that particularly tickled \nthe maces, bags, and purses.\n\nHow many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched \nforth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very \nwide question.  From the master upon whose impaling files reams of \ndusty warrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into \nmany shapes, down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks\' Office \nwho has copied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under \nthat eternal heading, no man\'s nature has been made better by it.  \nIn trickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, \nunder false pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can \nnever come to good.  The very solicitors\' boys who have kept the \nwretched suitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. \nChizzle, Mizzle, or otherwise was particularly engaged and had \nappointments until dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and \nshuffle into themselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce.  The receiver \nin the cause has acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has \nacquired too a distrust of his own mother and a contempt for his \nown kind.  Chizzle, Mizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit \nof vaguely promising themselves that they will look into that \noutstanding little matter and see what can be done for Drizzle--who \nwas not well used--when Jarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of \nthe office.  Shirking and sharking in all their many varieties have \nbeen sown broadcast by the ill-fated cause; and even those who have \ncontemplated its history from the outermost circle of such evil \nhave been insensibly tempted into a loose way of letting bad things \nalone to take their own bad course, and a loose belief that if the \nworld go wrong it was in some off-hand manner never meant to go \nright.\n\nThus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog, sits the \nLord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.\n\n\"Mr. Tangle,\" says the Lord High Chancellor, latterly something \nrestless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman.\n\n\"Mlud,\" says Mr. Tangle.  Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and \nJarndyce than anybody.  He is famous for it--supposed never to have \nread anything else since he left school.\n\n\"Have you nearly concluded your argument?\"\n\n\"Mlud, no--variety of points--feel it my duty tsubmit--ludship,\" is \nthe reply that slides out of Mr. Tangle.\n\n\"Several members of the bar are still to be heard, I believe?\" says \nthe Chancellor with a slight smile.\n\nEighteen of Mr. Tangle\'s learned friends, each armed with a little \nsummary of eighteen hundred sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in \na pianoforte, make eighteen bows, and drop into their eighteen \nplaces of obscurity.\n\n\"We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight,\" says the \nChancellor.  For the question at issue is only a question of costs, \na mere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and really will \ncome to a settlement one of these days.\n\nThe Chancellor rises; the bar rises; the prisoner is brought \nforward in a hurry; the man from Shropshire cries, \"My lord!\"  \nMaces, bags, and purses indignantly proclaim silence and frown at \nthe man from Shropshire.\n\n\"In reference,\" proceeds the Chancellor, still on Jarndyce and \nJarndyce, \"to the young girl--\" \n\n\"Begludship\'s pardon--boy,\" says Mr. Tangle prematurely.  \"In \nreference,\" proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness, \"to \nthe young girl and boy, the two young people\"--Mr. Tangle crushed--\n\"whom I directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my \nprivate room, I will see them and satisfy myself as to the \nexpediency of making the order for their residing with their \nuncle.\"\n\nMr. Tangle on his legs again.  \"Begludship\'s pardon--dead.\"\n\n\"With their\"--Chancellor looking through his double eyeglass at the \npapers on his desk--\"grandfather.\"\n\n\"Begludship\'s pardon--victim of rash action--brains.\"\n\nSuddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises, \nfully inflated, in the back settlements of the fog, and says, \"Will \nyour lordship allow me?  I appear for him.  He is a cousin, several \ntimes removed.  I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court \nin what exact remove he is a cousin, but he IS a cousin.\n\nLeaving this address (delivered like a sepulchral message) ringing \nin the rafters of the roof, the very little counsel drops, and the \nfog knows him no more.  Everybody looks for him.  Nobody can see \nhim.\n\n\"I will speak with both the young people,\" says the Chancellor \nanew, \"and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with \ntheir cousin.  I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I \ntake my seat.\"\n\nThe Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is \npresented.  Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner\'s \nconglomeration but his being sent back to prison, which is soon \ndone.  The man from Shropshire ventures another remonstrative \"My \nlord!\" but the Chancellor, being aware of him, has dexterously \nvanished.  Everybody else quickly vanishes too.  A battery of blue \nbags is loaded with heavy charges of papers and carried off by \nclerks; the little mad old woman marches off with her documents; \nthe empty court is locked up.  If all the injustice it has \ncommitted and all the misery it has caused could only be locked up \nwith it, and the whole burnt away in a great funeral pyre--why so \nmuch the better for other parties than the parties in Jarndyce and \nJarndyce!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIn Fashion\n\n\nIt is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this \nsame miry afternoon.  It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but \nthat we may pass from the one scene to the other, as the crow \nflies.  Both the world of fashion and the Court of Chancery are \nthings of precedent and usage: oversleeping Rip Van Winkles who \nhave played at strange games through a deal of thundery weather; \nsleeping beauties whom the knight will wake one day, when all the \nstopped spits in the kitchen shall begin to turn prodigiously!\n\nIt is not a large world.  Relatively even to this world of ours, \nwhich has its limits too (as your Highness shall find when you have \nmade the tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond), \nit is a very little speck.  There is much good in it; there are \nmany good and true people in it; it has its appointed place.  But \nthe evil of it is that it is a world wrapped up in too much \njeweller\'s cotton and fine wool, and cannot hear the rushing of the \nlarger worlds, and cannot see them as they circle round the sun.  \nIt is a deadened world, and its growth is sometimes unhealthy for \nwant of air.\n\nMy Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days \nprevious to her departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to \nstay some weeks, after which her movements are uncertain.  The \nfashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians, \nand it knows all fashionable things.  To know things otherwise were \nto be unfashionable.  My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she \ncalls, in familiar conversation, her \"place\" in Lincolnshire.  The \nwaters are out in Lincolnshire.  An arch of the bridge in the park \nhas been sapped and sopped away.  The adjacent low-lying ground for \nhalf a mile in breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees \nfor islands in it and a surface punctured all over, all day long, \nwith falling rain.  My Lady Dedlock\'s place has been extremely \ndreary.  The weather for many a day and night has been so wet that \nthe trees seem wet through, and the soft loppings and prunings of \nthe woodman\'s axe can make no crash or crackle as they fall.  The \ndeer, looking soaked, leave quagmires where they pass.  The shot of \na rifle loses its sharpness in the moist air, and its smoke moves \nin a tardy little cloud towards the green rise, coppice-topped, \nthat makes a background for the falling rain.  The view from my \nLady Dedlock\'s own windows is alternately a lead-coloured view and \na view in Indian ink.  The vases on the stone terrace in the \nforeground catch the rain all day; and the heavy drops fall--drip, \ndrip, drip--upon the broad flagged pavement, called from old time \nthe Ghost\'s Walk, all night.  On Sundays the little church in the \npark is mouldy; the oaken pulpit breaks out into a cold sweat; and \nthere is a general smell and taste as of the ancient Dedlocks in \ntheir graves.  My Lady Dedlock (who is childless), looking out in \nthe early twilight from her boudoir at a keeper\'s lodge and seeing \nthe light of a fire upon the latticed panes, and smoke rising from \nthe chimney, and a child, chased by a woman, running out into the \nrain to meet the shining figure of a wrapped-up man coming through \nthe gate, has been put quite out of temper.  My Lady Dedlock says \nshe has been \"bored to death.\"\n\nTherefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in \nLincolnshire and has left it to the rain, and the crows, and the \nrabbits, and the deer, and the partridges and pheasants.  The \npictures of the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into \nthe damp walls in mere lowness of spirits, as the housekeeper has \npassed along the old rooms shutting up the shutters.  And when they \nwill next come forth again, the fashionable intelligence--which, \nlike the fiend, is omniscient of the past and present, but not the \nfuture--cannot yet undertake to say.\n\nSir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet, but there is no mightier \nbaronet than he.  His family is as old as the hills, and infinitely \nmore respectable.  He has a general opinion that the world might \nget on without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks.  He \nwould on the whole admit nature to be a good idea (a little low, \nperhaps, when not enclosed with a park-fence), but an idea \ndependent for its execution on your great county families.  He is a \ngentleman of strict conscience, disdainful of all littleness and \nmeanness and ready on the shortest notice to die any death you may \nplease to mention rather than give occasion for the least \nimpeachment of his integrity.  He is an honourable, obstinate, \ntruthful, high-spirited, intensely prejudiced, perfectly \nunreasonable man.\n\nSir Leicester is twenty years, full measure, older than my Lady.  \nHe will never see sixty-five again, nor perhaps sixty-six, nor yet \nsixty-seven.  He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a \nlittle stiffly.  He is of a worthy presence, with his light-grey \nhair and whiskers, his fine shirt-frill, his pure-white waistcoat, \nand his blue coat with bright buttons always buttoned.  He is \nceremonious, stately, most polite on every occasion to my Lady, and \nholds her personal attractions in the highest estimation.  His \ngallantry to my Lady, which has never changed since he courted her, \nis the one little touch of romantic fancy in him.\n\nIndeed, he married her for love.  A whisper still goes about that \nshe had not even family; howbeit, Sir Leicester had so much family \nthat perhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more.  But \nshe had beauty, pride, ambition, insolent resolve, and sense enough \nto portion out a legion of fine ladies.  Wealth and station, added \nto these, soon floated her upward, and for years now my Lady \nDedlock has been at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and \nat the top of the fashionable tree.\n\nHow Alexander wept when he had no more worlds to conquer, everybody \nknows--or has some reason to know by this time, the matter having \nbeen rather frequently mentioned.  My Lady Dedlock, having \nconquered HER world, fell not into the melting, but rather into the \nfreezing, mood.  An exhausted composure, a worn-out placidity, an \nequanimity of fatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction, \nare the trophies of her victory.  She is perfectly well-bred.  \nIf she could be translated to heaven to-morrow, she might be \nexpected to ascend without any rapture.\n\nShe has beauty still, and if it be not in its heyday, it is not yet \nin its autumn.  She has a fine face--originally of a character that \nwould be rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved into \nclassicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state.  \nHer figure is elegant and has the effect of being tall.  Not that \nshe is so, but that \"the most is made,\" as the Honourable Bob \nStables has frequently asserted upon oath, \"of all her points.\"  \nThe same authority observes that she is perfectly got up and \nremarks in commendation of her hair especially that she is the \nbest-groomed woman in the whole stud.\n\nWith all her perfections on her head, my Lady Dedlock has come up \nfrom her place in Lincolnshire (hotly pursued by the fashionable \nintelligence) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to \nher departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some \nweeks, after which her movements are uncertain.  And at her house \nin town, upon this muddy, murky afternoon, presents himself an old-\nfashioned old gentleman, attorney-at-law and eke solicitor of the \nHigh Court of Chancery, who has the honour of acting as legal \nadviser of the Dedlocks and has as many cast-iron boxes in his \noffice with that name outside as if the present baronet were the \ncoin of the conjuror\'s trick and were constantly being juggled \nthrough the whole set.  Across the hall, and up the stairs, and \nalong the passages, and through the rooms, which are very brilliant \nin the season and very dismal out of it--fairy-land to visit, but a \ndesert to live in--the old gentleman is conducted by a Mercury in \npowder to my Lady\'s presence.\n\nThe old gentleman is rusty to look at, but is reputed to have made \ngood thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and \naristocratic wills, and to be very rich.  He is surrounded by a \nmysterious halo of family confidences, of which he is known to be \nthe silent depository.  There are noble mausoleums rooted for \ncenturies in retired glades of parks among the growing timber and \nthe fern, which perhaps hold fewer noble secrets than walk abroad \namong men, shut up in the breast of Mr. Tulkinghorn.  He is of what \nis called the old school--a phrase generally meaning any school \nthat seems never to have been young--and wears knee-breeches tied \nwith ribbons, and gaiters or stockings.  One peculiarity of his \nblack clothes and of his black stockings, be they silk or worsted, \nis that they never shine.  Mute, close, irresponsive to any \nglancing light, his dress is like himself.  He never converses when \nnot professionaly consulted.  He is found sometimes, speechless but \nquite at home, at corners of dinner-tables in great country houses \nand near doors of drawing-rooms, concerning which the fashionable \nintelligence is eloquent, where everybody knows him and where half \nthe Peerage stops to say \"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\"  He \nreceives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with \nthe rest of his knowledge.\n\nSir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr. \nTulkinghorn.  There is an air of prescription about him which is \nalways agreeable to Sir Leicester; he receives it as a kind of \ntribute.  He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn\'s dress; there is a kind of \ntribute in that too.  It is eminently respectable, and likewise, in \na general way, retainer-like.  It expresses, as it were, the \nsteward of the legal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar, of \nthe Dedlocks.\n\nHas Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself?  It may be so, or it \nmay not, but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in \neverything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class--as \none of the leaders and representatives of her little world.  She \nsupposes herself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach \nand ken of ordinary mortals--seeing herself in her glass, where \nindeed she looks so.  Yet every dim little star revolving about \nher, from her maid to the manager of the Italian Opera, knows her \nweaknesses, prejudices, follies, haughtinesses, and caprices and \nlives upon as accurate a calculation and as nice a measure of her \nmoral nature as her dressmaker takes of her physical proportions.  \nIs a new dress, a new custom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new \nform of jewellery, a new dwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new \nanything, to be set up?  There are deferential people in a dozen \ncallings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects of nothing but prostration \nbefore her, who can tell you how to manage her as if she were a \nbaby, who do nothing but nurse her all their lives, who, humbly \naffecting to follow with profound subservience, lead her and her \nwhole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook all and bear them \noff as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet of the majestic \nLilliput.  \"If you want to address our people, sir,\" say Blaze and \nSparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady Dedlock and the \nrest--\"you must remember that you are not dealing with the general \npublic; you must hit our people in their weakest place, and their \nweakest place is such a place.\"  \"To make this article go down, \ngentlemen,\" say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to their friends the \nmanufacturers, \"you must come to us, because we know where to have \nthe fashionable people, and we can make it fashionable.\"  \"If you \nwant to get this print upon the tables of my high connexion, sir,\" \nsays Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, \"or if you want to get this dwarf \nor giant into the houses of my high connexion, sir, or if you want \nto secure to this entertainment the patronage of my high connexion, \nsir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for I have been \naccustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion, sir, and I \nmay tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my finger\"--\nin which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not exaggerate at \nall.\n\nTherefore, while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in \nthe Dedlock mind at present, it is very possible that he may.\n\n\"My Lady\'s cause has been again before the Chancellor, has it, Mr. \nTulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his hand.\n\n\"Yes.  It has been on again to-day,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, \nmaking one of his quiet bows to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the \nfire, shading her face with a hand-screen.\n\n\"It would be useless to ask,\" says my Lady with the dreariness of \nthe place in Lincolnshire still upon her, \"whether anything has \nbeen done.\"\n\n\"Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day,\" \nreplies Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\n\"Nor ever will be,\" says my Lady.\n\nSir Leicester has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit.  \nIt is a slow, expensive, British, constitutional kind of thing.  To \nbe sure, he has not a vital interest in the suit in question, her \npart in which was the only property my Lady brought him; and he has \na shadowy impression that for his name--the name of Dedlock--to be \nin a cause, and not in the title of that cause, is a most \nridiculous accident.  But he regards the Court of Chancery, even if \nit should involve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling \namount of confusion, as a something devised in conjunction with a \nvariety of other somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for \nthe eternal settlement (humanly speaking) of everything.  And he is \nupon the whole of a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his \ncountenance to any complaints respecting it would be to encourage \nsome person in the lower classes to rise up somewhere--like Wat \nTyler.\n\n\"As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file,\" says Mr. \nTulkinghorn, \"and as they are short, and as I proceed upon the \ntroublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with \nany new proceedings in a cause\"--cautious man Mr. Tulkinghorn, \ntaking no more responsibility than necessary--\"and further, as I \nsee you are going to Paris, I have brought them in my pocket.\"\n\n(Sir Leicester was going to Paris too, by the by, but the delight \nof the fashionable intelligence was in his Lady.)\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers, asks permission to place them \non a golden talisman of a table at my Lady\'s elbow, puts on his \nspectacles, and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp.\n\n\"\'In Chancery.  Between John Jarndyce--\'\"\n\nMy Lady interrupts, requesting him to miss as many of the formal \nhorrors as he can.\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower \ndown.  My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention.  \nSir Leicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to \nhave a stately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as \nranging among the national bulwarks.  It happens that the fire is \nhot where my Lady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful \nthan useful, being priceless but small.  My Lady, changing her \nposition, sees the papers on the table--looks at them nearer--looks \nat them nearer still--asks impulsively, \"Who copied that?\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn stops short, surprised by my Lady\'s animation and \nher unusual tone.\n\n\"Is it what you people call law-hand?\" she asks, looking full at \nhim in her careless way again and toying with her screen.\n\n\"Not quite.  Probably\"--Mr. Tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks--\n\"the legal character which it has was acquired after the original \nhand was formed.  Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Anything to vary this detestable monotony.  Oh, go on, do!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn reads again.  The heat is greater; my Lady screens \nher face.  Sir Leicester dozes, starts up suddenly, and cries, \"Eh?  \nWhat do you say?\"\n\n\"I say I am afraid,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who had risen hastily, \n\"that Lady Dedlock is ill.\"\n\n\"Faint,\" my Lady murmurs with white lips, \"only that; but it is \nlike the faintness of death.  Don\'t speak to me.  Ring, and take me \nto my room!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber; bells ring, feet \nshuffle and patter, silence ensues.  Mercury at last begs Mr. \nTulkinghorn to return.\n\n\"Better now,\" quoth Sir Leicester, motioning the lawyer to sit down \nand read to him alone.  \"I have been quite alarmed.  I never knew \nmy Lady swoon before.  But the weather is extremely trying, and she \nreally has been bored to death down at our place in Lincolnshire.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA Progress\n\n\nI have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion \nof these pages, for I know I am not clever.  I always knew that.  I \ncan remember, when I was a very little girl indeed, I used to say \nto my doll when we were alone together, \"Now, Dolly, I am not \nclever, you know very well, and you must be patient with me, like a \ndear!\"  And so she used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, \nwith her beautiful complexion and rosy lips, staring at me--or not \nso much at me, I think, as at nothing--while I busily stitched away \nand told her every one of my secrets.\n\nMy dear old doll!  I was such a shy little thing that I seldom \ndared to open my lips, and never dared to open my heart, to anybody \nelse.  It almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be \nto me when I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my \nroom and say, \"Oh, you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would be \nexpecting me!\" and then to sit down on the floor, leaning on the \nelbow of her great chair, and tell her all I had noticed since we \nparted.  I had always rather a noticing way--not a quick way, oh, \nno!--a silent way of noticing what passed before me and thinking I \nshould like to understand it better.  I have not by any means a \nquick understanding.  When I love a person very tenderly indeed, it \nseems to brighten.  But even that may be my vanity.\n\nI was brought up, from my earliest remembrance--like some of the \nprincesses in the fairy stories, only I was not charming--by my \ngodmother.  At least, I only knew her as such.  She was a good, \ngood woman!  She went to church three times every Sunday, and to \nmorning prayers on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures whenever \nthere were lectures; and never missed.  She was handsome; and if \nshe had ever smiled, would have been (I used to think) like an \nangel--but she never smiled.  She was always grave and strict.  She \nwas so very good herself, I thought, that the badness of other \npeople made her frown all her life.  I felt so different from her, \neven making every allowance for the differences between a child and \na woman; I felt so poor, so trifling, and so far off that I never \ncould be unrestrained with her--no, could never even love her as I \nwished.  It made me very sorry to consider how good she was and how \nunworthy of her I was, and I used ardently to hope that I might \nhave a better heart; and I talked it over very often with the dear \nold doll, but I never loved my godmother as I ought to have loved \nher and as I felt I must have loved her if I had been a better \ngirl.\n\nThis made me, I dare say, more timid and retiring than I naturally \nwas and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at \nease.  But something happened when I was still quite a little thing \nthat helped it very much.\n\nI had never heard my mama spoken of.  I had never heard of my papa \neither, but I felt more interested about my mama.  I had never worn \na black frock, that I could recollect.  I had never been shown my \nmama\'s grave.  I had never been told where it was.  Yet I had never \nbeen taught to pray for any relation but my godmother.  I had more \nthan once approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael, \nour only servant, who took my light away when I was in bed (another \nvery good woman, but austere to me), and she had only said, \n\"Esther, good night!\" and gone away and left me.\n\nAlthough there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I \nwas a day boarder, and although they called me little Esther \nSummerson, I knew none of them at home.  All of them were older \nthan I, to be sure (I was the youngest there by a good deal), but \nthere seemed to be some other separation between us besides that, \nand besides their being far more clever than I was and knowing much \nmore than I did.  One of them in the first week of my going to the \nschool (I remember it very well) invited me home to a little party, \nto my great joy.  But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining \nfor me, and I never went.  I never went out at all.\n\nIt was my birthday.  There were holidays at school on other \nbirthdays--none on mine.  There were rejoicings at home on other \nbirthdays, as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one \nanother--there were none on mine.  My birthday was the most \nmelancholy day at home in the whole year.\n\nI have mentioned that unless my vanity should deceive me (as I know \nit may, for I may be very vain without suspecting it, though indeed \nI don\'t), my comprehension is quickened when my affection is.  My \ndisposition is very affectionate, and perhaps I might still feel \nsuch a wound if such a wound could be received more than once with \nthe quickness of that birthday.\n\nDinner was over, and my godmother and I were sitting at the table \nbefore the fire.  The clock ticked, the fire clicked; not another \nsound had been heard in the room or in the house for I don\'t know \nhow long.  I happened to look timidly up from my stitching, across \nthe table at my godmother, and I saw in her face, looking gloomily \nat me, \"It would have been far better, little Esther, that you had \nhad no birthday, that you had never been born!\"\n\nI broke out crying and sobbing, and I said, \"Oh, dear godmother, \ntell me, pray do tell me, did Mama die on my birthday?\"\n\n\"No,\" she returned.  \"Ask me no more, child!\"\n\n\"Oh, do pray tell me something of her.  Do now, at last, dear \ngodmother, if you please!  What did I do to her?  How did I lose \nher?  Why am I so different from other children, and why is it my \nfault, dear godmother?  No, no, no, don\'t go away.  Oh, speak to \nme!\"\n\nI was in a kind of fright beyond my grief, and I caught hold of her \ndress and was kneeling to her.  She had been saying all the while, \n\"Let me go!\"  But now she stood still.\n\nHer darkened face had such power over me that it stopped me in the \nmidst of my vehemence.  I put up my trembling little hand to clasp \nhers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might, but \nwithdrew it as she looked at me, and laid it on my fluttering \nheart.  She raised me, sat in her chair, and standing me before \nher, said slowly in a cold, low voice--I see her knitted brow and \npointed finger--\"Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you \nwere hers.  The time will come--and soon enough--when you will \nunderstand this better and will feel it too, as no one save a woman \ncan.  I have forgiven her\"--but her face did not relent--\"the wrong \nshe did to me, and I say no more of it, though it was greater than \nyou will ever know--than any one will ever know but I, the \nsufferer.  For yourself, unfortunate girl, orphaned and degraded \nfrom the first of these evil anniversaries, pray daily that the \nsins of others be not visited upon your head, according to what is \nwritten.  Forget your mother and leave all other people to forget \nher who will do her unhappy child that greatest kindness.  Now, \ngo!\"\n\nShe checked me, however, as I was about to depart from her--so \nfrozen as I was!--and added this, \"Submission, self-denial, \ndiligent work, are the preparations for a life begun with such a \nshadow on it.  You are different from other children, Esther, \nbecause you were not born, like them, in common sinfulness and \nwrath.  You are set apart.\"\n\nI went up to my room, and crept to bed, and laid my doll\'s cheek \nagainst mine wet with tears, and holding that solitary friend upon \nmy bosom, cried myself to sleep.  Imperfect as my understanding of \nmy sorrow was, I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to \nanybody\'s heart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was \nto me.\n\nDear, dear, to think how much time we passed alone together \nafterwards, and how often I repeated to the doll the story of my \nbirthday and confided to her that I would try as hard as ever I \ncould to repair the fault I had been born with (of which I \nconfessedly felt guilty and yet innocent) and would strive as I \ngrew up to be industrious, contented, and kind-hearted and to do \nsome good to some one, and win some love to myself if I could.  I \nhope it is not self-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it.  \nI am very thankful, I am very cheerful, but I cannot quite help \ntheir coming to my eyes.\n\nThere! I have wiped them away now and can go on again properly.\n\nI felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more \nafter the birthday, and felt so sensible of filling a place in her \nhouse which ought to have been empty, that I found her more \ndifficult of approach, though I was fervently grateful to her in my \nheart, than ever.  I felt in the same way towards my school \ncompanions; I felt in the same way towards Mrs. Rachael, who was a \nwidow; and oh, towards her daughter, of whom she was proud, who \ncame to see her once a fortnight!  I was very retired and quiet, \nand tried to be very diligent.\n\nOne sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books \nand portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was \ngliding upstairs to my room as usual, my godmother looked out of \nthe parlour-door and called me back.  Sitting with her, I found--\nwhich was very unusual indeed--a stranger.  A portly, important-\nlooking gentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large \ngold watch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring \nupon his little finger.\n\n\"This,\" said my godmother in an undertone, \"is the child.\"  Then \nshe said in her naturally stern way of speaking, \"This is Esther, \nsir.\"\n\nThe gentleman put up his eye-glasses to look at me and said, \"Come \nhere, my dear!\"  He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my \nbonnet, looking at me all the while.  When I had complied, he said, \n\"Ah!\" and afterwards \"Yes!\"  And then, taking off his eye-glasses \nand folding them in a red case, and leaning back in his arm-chair, \nturning the case about in his two hands, he gave my godmother a \nnod.  Upon that, my godmother said, \"You may go upstairs, Esther!\"  \nAnd I made him my curtsy and left him.\n\nIt must have been two years afterwards, and I was almost fourteen, \nwhen one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside.  I \nwas reading aloud, and she was listening.  I had come down at nine \no\'clock as I always did to read the Bible to her, and was reading \nfrom St. John how our Saviour stooped down, writing with his finger \nin the dust, when they brought the sinful woman to him.\n\n\"\'So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said \nunto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a \nstone at her!\'\"\n\nI was stopped by my godmother\'s rising, putting her hand to her \nhead, and crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of \nthe book, \"\'Watch ye, therefore, lest coming suddenly he find you \nsleeping.  And what I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!\'\"\n\nIn an instant, while she stood before me repeating these words, she \nfell down on the floor.  I had no need to cry out; her voice had \nsounded through the house and been heard in the street.\n\nShe was laid upon her bed.  For more than a week she lay there, \nlittle altered outwardly, with her old handsome resolute frown that \nI so well knew carved upon her face.  Many and many a time, in the \nday and in the night, with my head upon the pillow by her that my \nwhispers might be plainer to her, I kissed her, thanked her, prayed \nfor her, asked her for her blessing and forgiveness, entreated her \nto give me the least sign that she knew or heard me.  No, no, no.  \nHer face was immovable.  To the very last, and even afterwards, her \nfrown remained unsoftened.\n\nOn the day after my poor good godmother was buried, the gentleman \nin black with the white neckcloth reappeared.  I was sent for by \nMrs. Rachael, and found him in the same place, as if he had never \ngone away.\n\n\"My name is Kenge,\" he said; \"you may remember it, my child; Kenge \nand Carboy, Lincoln\'s Inn.\"\n\nI replied that I remembered to have seen him once before.\n\n\"Pray be seated--here near me.  Don\'t distress yourself; it\'s of no \nuse.  Mrs. Rachael, I needn\'t inform you who were acquainted with \nthe late Miss Barbary\'s affairs, that her means die with her and \nthat this young lady, now her aunt is dead--\"\n\n\"My aunt, sir!\"\n\n\"It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is \nto be gained by it,\" said Mr. Kenge smoothly, \"Aunt in fact, though \nnot in law.  Don\'t distress yourself!  Don\'t weep!  Don\'t tremble!  \nMrs. Rachael, our young friend has no doubt heard of--the--a--\nJarndyce and Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Mrs. Rachael.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" pursued Mr. Kenge, putting up his eye-glasses, \n\"that our young friend--I BEG you won\'t distress yourself!--never \nheard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\"\n\nI shook my head, wondering even what it was.\n\n\"Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?\" said Mr. Kenge, looking over his \nglasses at me and softly turning the case about and about as if he \nwere petting something.  \"Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits \nknown?  Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce--the--a--in itself a monument \nof Chancery practice.  In which (I would say) every difficulty, \nevery contingency, every masterly fiction, every form of procedure \nknown in that court, is represented over and over again?  It is a \ncause that could not exist out of this free and great country.  I \nshould say that the aggregate of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, \nMrs. Rachael\"--I was afraid he addressed himself to her because I \nappeared inattentive\"--amounts at the present hour to from SIX-ty \nto SEVEN-ty THOUSAND POUNDS!\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning back in his \nchair.\n\nI felt very ignorant, but what could I do?  I was so entirely \nunacquainted with the subject that I understood nothing about it \neven then.\n\n\"And she really never heard of the cause!\" said Mr. Kenge.  \n\"Surprising!\"\n\n\"Miss Barbary, sir,\" returned Mrs. Rachael, \"who is now among the \nSeraphim--\"\n\n\"I hope so, I am sure,\" said Mr. Kenge politely.\n\n\"--Wished Esther only to know what would be serviceable to her.  \nAnd she knows, from any teaching she has had here, nothing more.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Kenge.  \"Upon the whole, very proper.  Now to the \npoint,\" addressing me.  \"Miss Barbary, your sole relation (in fact \nthat is, for I am bound to observe that in law you had none) being \ndeceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs. \nRachael--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no!\" said Mrs. Rachael quickly.\n\n\"Quite so,\" assented Mr. Kenge; \"--that Mrs. Rachael should charge \nherself with your maintenance and support (I beg you won\'t distress \nyourself), you are in a position to receive the renewal of an offer \nwhich I was instructed to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago \nand which, though rejected then, was understood to be renewable \nunder the lamentable circumstances that have since occurred.  Now, \nif I avow that I represent, in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise, \na highly humane, but at the same time singular, man, shall I \ncompromise myself by any stretch of my professional caution?\" said \nMr. Kenge, leaning back in his chair again and looking calmly at us \nboth.\n\nHe appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his own voice.  \nI couldn\'t wonder at that, for it was mellow and full and gave \ngreat importance to every word he uttered.  He listened to himself \nwith obvious satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to his own \nmusic with his head or rounded a sentence with his hand.  I was \nvery much impressed by him--even then, before I knew that he formed \nhimself on the model of a great lord who was his client and that he \nwas generally called Conversation Kenge.\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he pursued, \"being aware of the--I would say, \ndesolate--position of our young friend, offers to place her at a \nfirst-rate establishment where her education shall be completed, \nwhere her comfort shall be secured, where her reasonable wants \nshall be anticipated, where she shall be eminently qualified to \ndischarge her duty in that station of life unto which it has \npleased--shall I say Providence?--to call her.\"\n\nMy heart was filled so full, both by what he said and by his \naffecting manner of saying it, that I was not able to speak, though \nI tried.\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he went on, \"makes no condition beyond expressing \nhis expectation that our young friend will not at any time remove \nherself from the establishment in question without his knowledge \nand concurrence.  That she will faithfully apply herself to the \nacquisition of those accomplishments, upon the exercise of which \nshe will be ultimately dependent.  That she will tread in the paths \nof virtue and honour, and--the--a--so forth.\"\n\nI was still less able to speak than before.\n\n\"Now, what does our young friend say?\" proceeded Mr, Kenge.  \"Take \ntime, take time!  I pause for her reply.  But take time!\"\n\nWhat the destitute subject of such an offer tried to say, I need \nnot repeat.  What she did say, I could more easily tell, if it were \nworth the telling.  What she felt, and will feel to her dying hour, \nI could never relate.\n\nThis interview took place at Windsor, where I had passed (as far as \nI knew) my whole life.  On that day week, amply provided with all \nnecessaries, I left it, inside the stagecoach, for Reading.\n\nMrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting, but I was \nnot so good, and wept bitterly.  I thought that I ought to have \nknown her better after so many years and ought to have made myself \nenough of a favourite with her to make her sorry then.  When she \ngave me one cold parting kiss upon my forehead, like a thaw-drop \nfrom the stone porch--it was a very frosty day--I felt so miserable \nand self-reproachful that I clung to her and told her it was my \nfault, I knew, that she could say good-bye so easily!\n\n\"No, Esther!\" she returned.  \"It is your misfortune!\"\n\nThe coach was at the little lawn-gate--we had not come out until we \nheard the wheels--and thus I left her, with a sorrowful heart.  She \nwent in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof and shut the \ndoor.  As long as I could see the house, I looked back at it from \nthe window through my tears.  My godmother had left Mrs. Rachael \nall the little property she possessed; and there was to be a sale; \nand an old hearth-rug with roses on it, which always seemed to me \nthe first thing in the world I had ever seen, was hanging outside \nin the frost and snow.  A day or two before, I had wrapped the dear \nold doll in her own shawl and quietly laid her--I am half ashamed \nto tell it--in the garden-earth under the tree that shaded my old \nwindow.  I had no companion left but my bird, and him I carried \nwith me in his cage.\n\nWhen the house was out of sight, I sat, with my bird-cage in the \nstraw at my feet, forward on the low seat to look out of the high \nwindow, watching the frosty trees, that were like beautiful pieces \nof spar, and the fields all smooth and white with last night\'s \nsnow, and the sun, so red but yielding so little heat, and the ice, \ndark like metal where the skaters and sliders had brushed the snow \naway.  There was a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite \nseat and looked very large in a quantity of wrappings, but he sat \ngazing out of the other window and took no notice of me.\n\nI thought of my dead godmother, of the night when I read to her, of \nher frowning so fixedly and sternly in her bed, of the strange \nplace I was going to, of the people I should find there, and what \nthey would be like, and what they would say to me, when a voice in \nthe coach gave me a terrible start.\n\nIt said, \"What the de-vil are you crying for?\"\n\nI was so frightened that I lost my voice and could only answer in a \nwhisper, \"Me, sir?\"  For of course I knew it must have been the \ngentleman in the quantity of wrappings, though he was still looking \nout of his window.\n\n\"Yes, you,\" he said, turning round.\n\n\"I didn\'t know I was crying, sir,\" I faltered.\n\n\"But you are!\" said the gentleman.  \"Look here!\"  He came quite \nopposite to me from the other corner of the coach, brushed one of \nhis large furry cuffs across my eyes (but without hurting me), and \nshowed me that it was wet.\n\n\"There!  Now you know you are,\" he said.  \"Don\'t you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"And what are you crying for?\" said the genfleman, \"Don\'t you want \nto go there?\"\n\n\"Where, sir?\"\n\n\"Where?  Why, wherever you are going,\" said the gentleman.\n\n\"I am very glad to go there, sir,\" I answered.\n\n\"Well, then!  Look glad!\" said the gentleman.\n\nI thought he was very strange, or at least that what I could see of \nhim was very strange, for he was wrapped up to the chin, and his \nface was almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur straps at the \nside of his head fastened under his chin; but I was composed again, \nand not afraid of him.  So I told him that I thought I must have \nbeen crying because of my godmother\'s death and because of Mrs. \nRachael\'s not being sorry to part with me.\n\n\"Confound Mrs. Rachael!\" said the gentleman.  \"Let her fly away in \na high wind on a broomstick!\"\n\nI began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the \ngreatest astonishment.  But I thought that he had pleasant eyes, \nalthough he kept on muttering to himself in an angry manner and \ncalling Mrs. Rachael names.\n\nAfter a little while he opened his outer wrapper, which appeared to \nme large enough to wrap up the whole coach, and put his arm down \ninto a deep pocket in the side.\n\n\"Now, look here!\" he said.  \"In this paper,\" which was nicely \nfolded, \"is a piece of the best plum-cake that can be got for \nmoney--sugar on the outside an inch thick, like fat on mutton \nchops.  Here\'s a little pie (a gem this is, both for size and \nquality), made in France.  And what do you suppose it\'s made of?  \nLivers of fat geese.  There\'s a pie!  Now let\'s see you eat \'em.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I replied; \"thank you very much indeed, but I \nhope you won\'t be offended--they are too rich for me.\"\n\n\"Floored again!\" said the gentleman, which I didn\'t at all \nunderstand, and threw them both out of window.\n\nHe did not speak to me any more until he got out of the coach a \nlittle way short of Reading, when he advised me to be a good girl \nand to be studious, and shook hands with me.  I must say I was \nrelieved by his departure.  We left him at a milestone.  I often \nwalked past it afterwards, and never for a long time without \nthinking of him and half expecting to meet him.  But I never did; \nand so, as time went on, he passed out of my mind.\n\nWhen the coach stopped, a very neat lady looked up at the window \nand said, \"Miss Donny.\"\n\n\"No, ma\'am, Esther Summerson.\"\n\n\"That is quite right,\" said the lady, \"Miss Donny.\"\n\nI now understood that she introduced herself by that name, and \nbegged Miss Donny\'s pardon for my mistake, and pointed out my boxes \nat her request.  Under the direction of a very neat maid, they were \nput outside a very small green carriage; and then Miss Donny, the \nmaid, and I got inside and were driven away.\n\n\"Everything is ready for you, Esther,\" said Miss Donny, \"and the \nscheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact accordance with \nthe wishes of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"Of--did you say, ma\'am?\"\n\n\"Of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Miss Donny.\n\nI was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too \nsevere for me and lent me her smelling-bottle.\n\n\"Do you know my--guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, ma\'am?\" I asked after a \ngood deal of hesitation.\n\n\"Not personally, Esther,\" said Miss Donny; \"merely through his \nsolicitors, Messrs. Kenge and Carboy, of London.  A very superior \ngentleman, Mr. Kenge.  Truly eloquent indeed.  Some of his periods \nquite majestic!\"\n\nI felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it.  \nOur speedy arrival at our destination, before I had time to recover \nmyself, increased my confusion, and I never shall forget the \nuncertain and the unreal air of everything at Greenleaf (Miss \nDonny\'s house) that afternoon!\n\nBut I soon became used to it.  I was so adapted to the routine of \nGreenleaf before long that I seemed to have been there a great \nwhile and almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old \nlife at my godmother\'s.  Nothing could be more precise, exact, and \norderly than Greenleaf.  There was a time for everything all round \nthe dial of the clock, and everything was done at its appointed \nmoment.\n\nWe were twelve boarders, and there were two Miss Donnys, twins.  It \nwas understood that I would have to depend, by and by, on my \nqualifications as a governess, and I was not only instructed in \neverything that was taught at Greenleaf, but was very soon engaged \nin helping to instruct others.  Although I was treated in every \nother respect like the rest of the school, this single difference \nwas made in my case from the first.  As I began to know more, I \ntaught more, and so in course of time I had plenty to do, which I \nwas very fond of doing because it made the dear girls fond of me.  \nAt last, whenever a new pupil came who was a little downcast and \nunhappy, she was so sure--indeed I don\'t know why--to make a friend \nof me that all new-comers were confided to my care.  They said I \nwas so gentle, but I am sure THEY were!  I often thought of the \nresolution I had made on my birthday to try to be industrious, \ncontented, and true-hearted and to do some good to some one and win \nsome love if I could; and indeed, indeed, I felt almost ashamed to \nhave done so little and have won so much.\n\nI passed at Greenleaf six happy, quiet years.  I never saw in any \nface there, thank heaven, on my birthday, that it would have been \nbetter if I had never been born.  When the day came round, it \nbrought me so many tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room \nwas beautiful with them from New Year\'s Day to Christmas.\n\nIn those six years I had never been away except on visits at \nholiday time in the neighbourhood.  After the first six months or \nso I had taken Miss Donny\'s advice in reference to the propriety of \nwriting to Mr. Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful, and with \nher approval I had written such a letter.  I had received a formal \nanswer acknowledging its receipt and saying, \"We note the contents \nthereof, which shall be duly communicated to our client.\"  After \nthat I sometimes heard Miss Donny and her sister mention how \nregular my accounts were paid, and about twice a year I ventured to \nwrite a similar letter.  I always received by return of post \nexactly the same answer in the same round hand, with the signature \nof Kenge and Carboy in another writing, which I supposed to be Mr. \nKenge\'s.\n\nIt seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about \nmyself!  As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life!  But \nmy little body will soon fall into the background now.\n\nSix quiet years (I find I am saying it for the second time) I had \npassed at Greenleaf, seeing in those around me, as it might be in a \nlooking-glass, every stage of my own growth and change there, when, \none November morning, I received this letter.  I omit the date.\n\n\nOld Square, Lincoln\'s Inn\n\nMadam,\n\nJarndyce and Jarndyce\n\nOur clt Mr. Jarndyce being abt to rece into his house, under an \nOrder of the Ct of Chy, a Ward of the Ct in this cause, for whom he \nwishes to secure an elgble compn, directs us to inform you that he \nwill be glad of your serces in the afsd capacity.\n\nWe have arrngd for your being forded, carriage free, pr eight \no\'clock coach from Reading, on Monday morning next, to White Horse \nCellar, Piccadilly, London, where one of our clks will be in \nwaiting to convey you to our offe as above.\n\nWe are, Madam, Your obedt Servts,\n\nKenge and Carboy\n\nMiss Esther Summerson\n\n\nOh, never, never, never shall I forget the emotion this letter \ncaused in the house!  It was so tender in them to care so much for \nme, it was so gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to \nhave made my orphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so \nmany youthful natures towards me, that I could hardly bear it.  Not \nthat I would have had them less sorry--I am afraid not; but the \npleasure of it, and the pain of it, and the pride and joy of it, \nand the humble regret of it were so blended that my heart seemed \nalmost breaking while it was full of rapture.\n\nThe letter gave me only five days\' notice of my removal.  When \nevery minute added to the proofs of love and kindness that were \ngiven me in those five days, and when at last the morning came and \nwhen they took me through all the rooms that I might see them for \nthe last time, and when some cried, \"Esther, dear, say good-bye to \nme here at my bedside, where you first spoke so kindly to me!\" and \nwhen others asked me only to write their names, \"With Esther\'s \nlove,\" and when they all surrounded me with their parting presents \nand clung to me weeping and cried, \"What shall we do when dear, \ndear Esther\'s gone!\" and when I tried to tell them how forbearing \nand how good they had all been to me and how I blessed and thanked \nthem every one, what a heart I had!\n\nAnd when the two Miss Donnys grieved as much to part with me as the \nleast among them, and when the maids said, \"Bless you, miss, \nwherever you go!\" and when the ugly lame old gardener, who I \nthought had hardly noticed me in all those years, came panting \nafter the coach to give me a little nosegay of geraniums and told \nme I had been the light of his eyes--indeed the old man said so!--\nwhat a heart I had then!\n\nAnd could I help it if with all this, and the coming to the little \nschool, and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside \nwaving their hats and bonnets to me, and of a grey-haired gentleman \nand lady whose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I \nhad visited (who were said to be the proudest people in all that \ncountry), caring for nothing but calling out, \"Good-bye, Esther.  \nMay you be very happy!\"--could I help it if I was quite bowed down \nin the coach by myself and said \"Oh, I am so thankful, I am so \nthankful!\" many times over!\n\nBut of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I \nwas going after all that had been done for me.  Therefore, of \ncourse, I made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by \nsaying very often, \"Esther, now you really must!  This WILL NOT \ndo!\" I cheered myself up pretty well at last, though I am afraid I \nwas longer about it than I ought to have been; and when I had \ncooled my eyes with lavender water, it was time to watch for \nLondon.\n\nI was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles \noff, and when we really were there, that we should never get there.  \nHowever, when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement, and \nparticularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into \nus, and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance, I \nbegan to believe that we really were approaching the end of our \njourney.  Very soon afterwards we stopped.\n\nA young gentleman who had inked himself by accident addressed me \nfrom the pavement and said, \"I am from Kenge and Carboy\'s, miss, of \nLincoln\'s Inn.\"\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" said I.\n\nHe was very obliging, and as he handed me into a fly after \nsuperintending the removal of my boxes, I asked him whether there \nwas a great fire anywhere?  For the streets were so full of dense \nbrown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen.\n\n\"Oh, dear no, miss,\" he said.  \"This is a London particular.\"\n\nI had never heard of such a thing.\n\n\"A fog, miss,\" said the young gentleman.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said I.\n\nWe drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest streets that ever \nwere seen in the world (I thought) and in such a distracting state \nof confusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses, \nuntil we passed into sudden quietude under an old gateway and drove \non through a silent square until we came to an odd nook in a \ncorner, where there was an entrance up a steep, broad flight of \nstairs, like an entrance to a church.  And there really was a \nchurchyard outside under some cloisters, for I saw the gravestones \nfrom the staircase window.\n\nThis was Kenge and Carboy\'s.  The young gentleman showed me through \nan outer office into Mr. Kenge\'s room--there was no one in it--and \npolitely put an arm-chair for me by the fire.  He then called my \nattention to a little looking-glass hanging from a nail on one side \nof the chimney-piece.\n\n\"In case you should wish to look at yourself, miss, after the \njourney, as you\'re going before the Chancellor.  Not that it\'s \nrequisite, I am sure,\" said the young gentleman civilly.\n\n\"Going before the Chancellor?\" I said, startled for a moment.\n\n\"Only a matter of form, miss,\" returned the young gentleman.  \"Mr. \nKenge is in court now.  He left his compliments, and would you \npartake of some refreshment\"--there were biscuits and a decanter of \nwine on a small table--\"and look over the paper,\" which the young \ngentleman gave me as he spoke.  He then stirred the fire and left \nme.\n\nEverything was so strange--the stranger from its being night in the \nday-time, the candles burning with a white flame, and looking raw \nand cold--that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing \nwhat they meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly.  \nAs it was of no use going on in that way, I put the paper down, \ntook a peep at my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat, and \nlooked at the room, which was not half lighted, and at the shabby, \ndusty tables, and at the piles of writings, and at a bookcase full \nof the most inexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to \nsay for themselves.  Then I went on, thinking, thinking, thinking; \nand the fire went on, burning, burning, burning; and the candles \nwent on flickering and guttering, and there were no snuffers--until \nthe young gentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair--for two \nhours.\n\nAt last Mr. Kenge came.  HE was not altered, but he was surprised \nto see how altered I was and appeared quite pleased.  \"As you are \ngoing to be the companion of the young lady who is now in the \nChancellor\'s private room, Miss Summerson,\" he said, \"we thought it \nwell that you should be in attendance also.  You will not be \ndiscomposed by the Lord Chancellor, I dare say?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" I said, \"I don\'t think I shall,\" really not seeing on \nconsideration why I should be.\n\nSo Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went round the corner, under a \ncolonnade, and in at a side door.  And so we came, along a passage, \ninto a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young \ngentleman were standing near a great, loud-roaring fire.  A screen \nwas interposed between them and it, and they were leaning on the \nscreen, talking.\n\nThey both looked up when I came in, and I saw in the young lady, \nwith the fire shining upon her, such a beautiful girl!  With such \nrich golden hair, such soft blue eyes, and such a bright, innocent, \ntrusting face!\n\n\"Miss Ada,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"this is Miss Summerson.\"\n\nShe came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended, \nbut seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me.  In short, \nshe had such a natural, captivating, winning manner that in a few \nminutes we were sitting in the window-seat, with the light of the \nfire upon us, talking together as free and happy as could be.\n\nWhat a load off my mind!  It was so delightful to know that she \ncould confide in me and like me!  It was so good of her, and so \nencouraging to me!\n\nThe young gentleman was her distant cousin, she told me, and his \nname Richard Carstone.  He was a handsome youth with an ingenuous \nface and a most engaging laugh; and after she had called him up to \nwhere we sat, he stood by us, in the light of the fire, talking \ngaily, like a light-hearted boy.  He was very young, not more than \nnineteen then, if quite so much, but nearly two years older than \nshe was.  They were both orphans and (what was very unexpected and \ncurious to me) had never met before that day.  Our all three coming \ntogether for the first time in such an unusual place was a thing to \ntalk about, and we talked about it; and the fire, which had left \noff roaring, winked its red eyes at us--as Richard said--like a \ndrowsy old Chancery lion.\n\nWe conversed in a low tone because a full-dressed gentleman in a \nbag wig frequenfly came in and out, and when he did so, we could \nhear a drawling sound in the distance, which he said was one of the \ncounsel in our case addressing the Lord Chancellor.  He told Mr. \nKenge that the Chancellor would be up in five minutes; and \npresently we heard a bustle and a tread of feet, and Mr. Kenge said \nthat the Court had risen and his lordship was in the next room.\n\nThe gentleman in the bag wig opened the door almost directly and \nrequested Mr. Kenge to come in.  Upon that, we all went into the \nnext room, Mr. Kenge first, with my darling--it is so natural to me \nnow that I can\'t help writing it; and there, plainly dressed in \nblack and sitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire, was his \nlordship, whose robe, trimmed with beautiful gold lace, was thrown \nupon another chair.  He gave us a searching look as we entered, but \nhis manner was both courtly and kind.\n\nThe gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of papers on his \nlordship\'s table, and his lordship silently selected one and turned \nover the leaves.\n\n\"Miss Clare,\" said the Lord Chancellor.  \"Miss Ada Clare?\"\n\nMr. Kenge presented her, and his lordship begged her to sit down \nnear him.  That he admired her and was interested by her even I \ncould see in a moment.  It touched me that the home of such a \nbeautiful young creature should be represented by that dry, \nofficial place.  The Lord High Chancellor, at his best, appeared so \npoor a substitute for the love and pride of parents.\n\n\"The Jarndyce in question,\" said the Lord Chancellor, still turning \nover leaves, \"is Jarndyce of Bleak House.\"\n\n\"Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\n\n\"A dreary name,\" said the Lord Chancellor.\n\n\"But not a dreary place at present, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\n\n\"And Bleak House,\" said his lordship, \"is in--\"\n\n\"Hertfordshire, my lord.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married?\" said his lordship.\n\n\"He is not, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present?\" said the Lord Chancellor, \nglancing towards him.\n\nRichard bowed and stepped forward.\n\n\"Hum!\" said the Lord Chancellor, turning over more leaves.\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" Mr. Kenge observed in a low \nvoice, \"if I may venture to remind your lordship, provides a \nsuitable companion for--\"\n\n\"For Mr. Richard Carstone?\" I thought (but I am not quite sure) I \nheard his lordship say in an equally low voice and with a smile.\n\n\"For Miss Ada Clare.  This is the young lady.  Miss Summerson.\"\n\nHis lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy \nvery graciously.\n\n\"Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause, I think?\"\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\nMr. Kenge leant over before it was quite said and whispered.  His \nlordship, with his eyes upon his papers, listened, nodded twice or \nthrice, turned over more leaves, and did not look towards me again \nuntil we were going away.\n\nMr. Kenge now retired, and Richard with him, to where I was, near \nthe door, leaving my pet (it is so natural to me that again I can\'t \nhelp it!) sitting near the Lord Chancellor, with whom his lordship \nspoke a little part, asking her, as she told me afterwards, whether \nshe had well reflected on the proposed arrangement, and if she \nthought she would be happy under the roof of Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak \nHouse, and why she thought so?  Presently he rose courteously and \nreleased her, and then he spoke for a minute or two with Richard \nCarstone, not seated, but standing, and altogether with more ease \nand less ceremony, as if he still knew, though he WAS Lord \nChancellor, how to go straight to the candour of a boy.\n\n\"Very well!\" said his lordship aloud.  \"I shall make the order.  \nMr. Jarndyce of Bleak House has chosen, so far as I may judge,\" and \nthis was when he looked at me, \"a very good companion for the young \nlady, and the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the \ncircumstances admit.\"\n\nHe dismissed us pleasantly, and we all went out, very much obliged \nto him for being so affable and polite, by which he had certainly \nlost no dignity but seemed to us to have gained some.\n\nWhen we got under the colonnade, Mr. Kenge remembered that he must \ngo back for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog, with \nthe Lord Chancellor\'s carriage and servants waiting for him to come \nout.\n\n\"Well!\" said Richard Carstone.  \"THAT\'S over!  And where do we go \nnext, Miss Summerson?\"\n\n\"Don\'t you know?\" I said.\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said he.\n\n\"And don\'t YOU know, my love?\" I asked Ada.\n\n\"No!\" said she.  \"Don\'t you?\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" said I.\n\nWe looked at one another, half laughing at our being like the \nchildren in the wood, when a curious little old woman in a squeezed \nbonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us \nwith an air of great ceremony.\n\n\"Oh!\" said she.  \"The wards in Jarndyce!  Ve-ry happy, I am sure, \nto have the honour!  It is a good omen for youth, and hope, and \nbeauty when they find themselves in this place, and don\'t know \nwhat\'s to come of it.\"\n\n\"Mad!\" whispered Richard, not thinking she could hear him.\n\n\"Right!  Mad, young gentleman,\" she returned so quickly that he was \nquite abashed.  \"I was a ward myself.  I was not mad at that time,\" \ncurtsying low and smiling between every little sentence.  \"I had \nyouth and hope.  I believe, beauty.  It matters very little now.  \nNeither of the three served or saved me.  I have the honour to \nattend court regularly.  With my documents.  I expect a judgment.  \nShortly.  On the Day of Judgment.  I have discovered that the sixth \nseal mentioned in the Revelations is the Great Seal.  It has been \nopen a long time!  Pray accept my blessing.\"\n\nAs Ada was a little frightened, I said, to humour the poor old \nlady, that we were much obliged to her.\n\n\"Ye-es!\" she said mincingly.  \"I imagine so.  And here is \nConversation Kenge.  With HIS documents!  How does your honourable \nworship do?\"\n\n\"Quite well, quite well!  Now don\'t be troublesome, that\'s a good \nsoul!\" said Mr. Kenge, leading the way back.\n\n\"By no means,\" said the poor old lady, keeping up with Ada and me.  \n\"Anything but troublesome.  I shall confer estates on both--which \nis not being troublesome, I trust?  I expect a judgment.  Shortly.  \nOn the Day of Judgment.  This is a good omen for you.  Accept my \nblessing!\"\n\nShe stopped at the bottom of the steep, broad flight of stairs; but \nwe looked back as we went up, and she was still there, saying, \nstill with a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence, \n\"Youth.  And hope.  And beauty.  And Chancery.  And Conversation \nKenge!  Ha!  Pray accept my blessing!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTelescopic Philanthropy\n\n\nWe were to pass the night, Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his \nroom, at Mrs. Jellyby\'s; and then he turned to me and said he took \nit for granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was.\n\n\"I really don\'t, sir,\" I returned.  \"Perhaps Mr. Carstone--or Miss \nClare--\"\n\nBut no, they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby.  \"In-deed!  \nMrs. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, standing with his back to the fire \nand casting his eyes over the dusty hearth-rug as if it were Mrs. \nJellyby\'s biography, \"is a lady of very remarkable strength of \ncharacter who devotes herself entirely to the public.  She has \ndevoted herself to an extensive variety of public subjects at \nvarious times and is at present (until something else attracts her) \ndevoted to the subject of Africa, with a view to the general \ncultivation of the coffee berry--AND the natives--and the happy \nsettlement, on the banks of the African rivers, of our \nsuperabundant home population.  Mr. Jarndyce, who is desirous to \naid any work that is considered likely to be a good work and who is \nmuch sought after by philanthropists, has, I believe, a very high \nopinion of Mrs. Jellyby.\"\n\nMr. Kenge, adjusting his cravat, then looked at us.\n\n\"And Mr. Jellyby, sir?\" suggested Richard.\n\n\"Ah!  Mr. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"is--a--I don\'t know that I can \ndescribe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of \nMrs. Jellyby.\"\n\n\"A nonentity, sir?\" said Richard with a droll look.\n\n\"I don\'t say that,\" returned Mr. Kenge gravely.  \"I can\'t say that, \nindeed, for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby.  I never, to my \nknowledge, had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby.  He may be a \nvery superior man, but he is, so to speak, merged--merged--in the \nmore shining qualities of his wife.\"  Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell \nus that as the road to Bleak House would have been very long, dark, \nand tedious on such an evening, and as we had been travelling \nalready, Mr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement.  A \ncarriage would be at Mrs. Jellyby\'s to convey us out of town early \nin the forenoon of to-morrow.\n\nHe then rang a little bell, and the young gentleman came in.  \nAddressing him by the name of Guppy, Mr. Kenge inquired whether \nMiss Summerson\'s boxes and the rest of the baggage had been \"sent \nround.\"  Mr. Guppy said yes, they had been sent round, and a coach \nwas waiting to take us round too as soon as we pleased.\n\n\"Then it only remains,\" said Mr. Kenge, shaking hands with us, \"for \nme to express my lively satisfaction in (good day, Miss Clare!) the \narrangement this day concluded and my (GOOD-bye to you, Miss \nSummerson!) lively hope that it will conduce to the happiness, the \n(glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance, Mr. \nCarstone!) welfare, the advantage in all points of view, of all \nconcerned!  Guppy, see the party safely there.\"\n\n\"Where IS \'there,\' Mr. Guppy?\" said Richard as we went downstairs.\n\n\"No distance,\" said Mr. Guppy; \"round in Thavies Inn, you know.\"\n\n\"I can\'t say I know where it is, for I come from Winchester and am \nstrange in London.\"\n\n\"Only round the corner,\" said Mr. Guppy.  \"We just twist up \nChancery Lane, and cut along Holborn, and there we are in four \nminutes\' time, as near as a toucher.  This is about a London \nparticular NOW, ain\'t it, miss?\"  He seemed quite delighted with it \non my account.\n\n\"The fog is very dense indeed!\" said I.\n\n\"Not that it affects you, though, I\'m sure,\" said Mr. Guppy, \nputting up the steps.  \"On the contrary, it seems to do you good, \nmiss, judging from your appearance.\"\n\nI knew he meant well in paying me this compliment, so I laughed at \nmyself for blushing at it when he had shut the door and got upon \nthe box; and we all three laughed and chatted about our \ninexperience and the strangeness of London until we turned up under \nan archway to our destination--a narrow street of high houses like \nan oblong cistern to hold the fog.  There was a confused little \ncrowd of people, principally children, gathered about the house at \nwhich we stopped, which had a tarnished brass plate on the door \nwith the inscription JELLYBY.\n\n\"Don\'t be frightened!\" said Mr. Guppy, looking in at the coach-\nwindow.  \"One of the young Jellybys been and got his head through \nthe area railings!\"\n\n\"Oh, poor child,\" said I; \"let me out, if you please!\"\n\n\"Pray be careful of yourself, miss.  The young Jellybys are always \nup to something,\" said Mr. Guppy.\n\nI made my way to the poor child, who was one of the dirtiest little \nunfortunates I ever saw, and found him very hot and frightened and \ncrying loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron railings, while a \nmilkman and a beadle, with the kindest intentions possible, were \nendeavouring to drag him back by the legs, under a general \nimpression that his skull was compressible by those means.  As I \nfound (after pacifying him) that he was a little boy with a \nnaturally large head, I thought that perhaps where his head could \ngo, his body could follow, and mentioned that the best mode of \nextrication might be to push him forward.  This was so favourably \nreceived by the milkman and beadle that he would immediately have \nbeen pushed into the area if I had not held his pinafore while \nRichard and Mr. Guppy ran down through the kitchen to catch him \nwhen he should be released.  At last he was happily got down \nwithout any accident, and then he began to beat Mr. Guppy with a \nhoop-stick in quite a frantic manner.\n\nNobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in \npattens, who had been poking at the child from below with a broom; \nI don\'t know with what object, and I don\'t think she did.  I \ntherefore supposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home, and was quite \nsurprised when the person appeared in the passage without the \npattens, and going up to the back room on the first floor before \nAda and me, announced us as, \"Them two young ladies, Missis \nJellyby!\"  We passed several more children on the way up, whom it \nwas difficult to avoid treading on in the dark; and as we came into \nMrs. Jellyby\'s presence, one of the poor little things fell \ndownstairs--down a whole flight (as it sounded to me), with a great \nnoise.\n\nMrs. Jellyby, whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we \ncould not help showing in our own faces as the dear child\'s head \nrecorded its passage with a bump on every stair--Richard afterwards \nsaid he counted seven, besides one for the landing--received us \nwith perfect equanimity.  She was a pretty, very diminutive, plump \nwoman of from forty to fifty, with handsome eyes, though they had a \ncurious habit of seeming to look a long way off.  As if--I am \nquoting Richard again--they could see nothing nearer than Africa!\n\n\"I am very glad indeed,\" said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice, \n\"to have the pleasure of receiving you.  I have a great respect for \nMr. Jarndyce, and no one in whom he is interested can be an object \nof indifference to me.\"\n\nWe expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door, \nwhere there was a lame invalid of a sofa.  Mrs. Jellyby had very \ngood hair but was too much occupied with her African duties to \nbrush it.  The shawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped \nonto her chair when she advanced to us; and as she turned to resume \nher seat, we could not help noticing that her dress didn\'t nearly \nmeet up the back and that the open space was railed across with a \nlattice-work of stay-lace--like a summer-house.\n\nThe room, which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great \nwriting-table covered with similar litter, was, I must say, not \nonly very untidy but very dirty.  We were obliged to take notice of \nthat with our sense of sight, even while, with our sense of \nhearing, we followed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs: I \nthink into the back kitchen, where somebody seemed to stifle him.\n\nBut what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy-looking \nthough by no means plain girl at the writing-table, who sat biting \nthe feather of her pen and staring at us.  I suppose nobody ever \nwas in such a state of ink.  And from her tumbled hair to her \npretty feet, which were disfigured with frayed and broken satin \nslippers trodden down at heel, she really seemed to have no article \nof dress upon her, from a pin upwards, that was in its proper \ncondition or its right place.\n\n\"You find me, my dears,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, snuffing the two great \noffice candles in tin candlesticks, which made the room taste \nstrongly of hot tallow (the fire had gone out, and there was \nnothing in the grate but ashes, a bundle of wood, and a poker), \n\"you find me, my dears, as usual, very busy; but that you will \nexcuse.  The African project at present employs my whole time.  It \ninvolves me in correspondence with public bodies and with private \nindividuals anxious for the welfare of their species all over the \ncountry.  I am happy to say it is advancing.  We hope by this time \nnext year to have from a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy \nfamilies cultivating coffee and educating the natives of \nBorrioboola-Gha, on the left bank of the Niger.\"\n\nAs Ada said nothing, but looked at me, I said it must be very \ngratifying.\n\n\"It IS gratifying,\" said Mrs. Jellyby.  \"It involves the devotion \nof all my energies, such as they are; but that is nothing, so that \nit succeeds; and I am more confident of success every day.  Do you \nknow, Miss Summerson, I almost wonder that YOU never turned your \nthoughts to Africa.\"\n\nThis application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that \nI was quite at a loss how to receive it.  I hinted that the \nclimate--\n\n\"The finest climate in the world!\" said Mrs. Jellyby.\n\n\"Indeed, ma\'am?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  With precaution,\" said Mrs. Jellyby.  \"You may go into \nHolborn, without precaution, and be run over.  You may go into \nHolborn, with precaution, and never be run over.  Just so with \nAfrica.\"\n\nI said, \"No doubt.\"  I meant as to Holborn.\n\n\"If you would like,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, putting a number of papers \ntowards us, \"to look over some remarks on that head, and on the \ngeneral subject, which have been extensively circulated, while I \nfinish a letter I am now dictating to my eldest daughter, who is my \namanuensis--\"\n\nThe girl at the table left off biting her pen and made a return to \nour recognition, which was half bashful and half sulky.\n\n\"--I shall then have finished for the present,\" proceeded Mrs. \nJellyby with a sweet smile, \"though my work is never done.  Where \nare you, Caddy?\"\n\n\"\'Presents her compliments to Mr. Swallow, and begs--\'\" said Caddy.\n\n\"\'And begs,\'\" said Mrs. Jellyby, dictating, \"\'to inform him, in \nreference to his letter of inquiry on the African project--\' No, \nPeepy!  Not on my account!\"\n\nPeepy (so self-named) was the unfortunate child who had fallen \ndownstairs, who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting \nhimself, with a strip of plaster on his forehead, to exhibit his \nwounded knees, in which Ada and I did not know which to pity most--\nthe bruises or the dirt.  Mrs. Jellyby merely added, with the \nserene composure with which she said everything, \"Go along, you \nnaughty Peepy!\" and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again.\n\nHowever, as she at once proceeded with her dictation, and as I \ninterrupted nothing by doing it, I ventured quietly to stop poor \nPeepy as he was going out and to take him up to nurse.  He looked \nvery much astonished at it and at Ada\'s kissing him, but soon fell \nfast asleep in my arms, sobbing at longer and longer intervals, \nuntil he was quiet.  I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the \nletter in detail, though I derived such a general impression from \nit of the momentous importance of Africa, and the utter \ninsignificance of all other places and things, that I felt quite \nashamed to have thought so little about it.\n\n\"Six o\'clock!\" said Mrs. Jellyby.  \"And our dinner hour is \nnominally (for we dine at all hours) five!  Caddy, show Miss Clare \nand Miss Summerson their rooms.  You will like to make some change, \nperhaps?  You will excuse me, I know, being so much occupied.  Oh, \nthat very bad child!  Pray put him down, Miss Summerson!\"\n\nI begged permission to retain him, truly saying that he was not at \nall troublesome, and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed.  \nAda and I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between.  \nThey were excessively bare and disorderly, and the curtain to my \nwindow was fastened up with a fork.\n\n\"You would like some hot water, wouldn\'t you?\" said Miss Jellyby, \nlooking round for a jug with a handle to it, but looking in vain.\n\n\"If it is not being troublesome,\" said we.\n\n\"Oh, it\'s not the trouble,\" returned Miss Jellyby; \"the question \nis, if there IS any.\"\n\nThe evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a marshy smell \nthat I must confess it was a little miserable, and Ada was half \ncrying.  We soon laughed, however, and were busily unpacking when \nMiss Jellyby came back to say that she was sorry there was no hot \nwater, but they couldn\'t find the kettle, and the boiler was out of \norder.\n\nWe begged her not to mention it and made all the haste we could to \nget down to the fire again.  But all the little children had come \nup to the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying \non my bed, and our attention was distracted by the constant \napparition of noses and fingers in situations of danger between the \nhinges of the doors.  It was impossible to shut the door of either \nroom, for my lock, with no knob to it, looked as if it wanted to be \nwound up; and though the handle of Ada\'s went round and round with \nthe greatest smoothness, it was attended with no effect whatever on \nthe door.  Therefore I proposed to the children that they should \ncome in and be very good at my table, and I would tell them the \nstory of Little Red Riding Hood while I dressed; which they did, \nand were as quiet as mice, including Peepy, who awoke opportunely \nbefore the appearance of the wolf.\n\nWhen we went downstairs we found a mug with \"A Present from \nTunbridge Wells\" on it lighted up in the staircase window with a \nfloating wick, and a young woman, with a swelled face bound up in a \nflannel bandage blowing the fire of the drawing-room (now connected \nby an open door with Mrs. Jellyby\'s room) and choking dreadfully.  \nIt smoked to that degree, in short, that we all sat coughing and \ncrying with the windows open for half an hour, during which Mrs. \nJellyby, with the same sweetness of temper, directed letters about \nAfrica.  Her being so employed was, I must say, a great relief to \nme, for Richard told us that he had washed his hands in a pie-dish \nand that they had found the kettle on his dressing-table, and he \nmade Ada laugh so that they made me laugh in the most ridiculous \nmanner.\n\nSoon after seven o\'clock we went down to dinner, carefully, by Mrs. \nJellyby\'s advice, for the stair-carpets, besides being very \ndeficient in stair-wires, were so torn as to be absolute traps.  We \nhad a fine cod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish of cutlets, and \na pudding; an excellent dinner, if it had had any cooking to speak \nof, but it was almost raw.  The young woman with the flannel \nbandage waited, and dropped everything on the table wherever it \nhappened to go, and never moved it again until she put it on the \nstairs.  The person I had seen in pattens, who I suppose to have \nbeen the cook, frequently came and skirmished with her at the door, \nand there appeared to be ill will between them.\n\nAll through dinner--which was long, in consequence of such \naccidents as the dish of potatoes being mislaid in the coal skuttle \nand the handle of the corkscrew coming off and striking the young \nwoman in the chin--Mrs. Jellyby preserved the evenness of her \ndisposition.  She told us a great deal that was interesting about \nBorrioboola-Gha and the natives, and received so many letters that \nRichard, who sat by her, saw four envelopes in the gravy at once.  \nSome of the letters were proceedings of ladies\' committees or \nresolutions of ladies\' meetings, which she read to us; others were \napplications from people excited in various ways about the \ncultivation of coffee, and natives; others required answers, and \nthese she sent her eldest daughter from the table three or four \ntimes to write.  She was full of business and undoubtedly was, as \nshe had told us, devoted to the cause.\n\nI was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in \nspectacles was, who dropped into a vacant chair (there was no top \nor bottom in particular) after the fish was taken away and seemed \npassively to submit himself to Borriohoola-Gha but not to be \nactively interested in that settlement.  As he never spoke a word, \nhe might have been a native but for his complexion.  It was not \nuntil we left the table and he remained alone with Richard that the \npossibility of his being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head.  But he \nWAS Mr. Jellyby; and a loquacious young man called Mr. Quale, with \nlarge shining knobs for temples and his hair all brushed to the \nback of his head, who came in the evening, and told Ada he was a \nphilanthropist, also informed her that he called the matrimonial \nalliance of Mrs. Jellyby with Mr. Jellyby the union of mind and \nmatter.\n\nThis young man, besides having a great deal to say for himself \nabout Africa and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists \nto teach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an \nexport trade, delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saving, \"I \nbelieve now, Mrs. Jellyby, you have received as many as from one \nhundred and fifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a \nsingle day, have you not?\" or, \"If my memory does not deceive me, \nMrs. Jellyby, you once mentioned that you had sent off five \nthousand circulars from one post-office at one time?\"--always \nrepeating Mrs. Jellyby\'s answer to us like an interpreter.  During \nthe whole evening, Mr. Jellyby sat in a corner with his head \nagainst the wall as if he were subject to low spirits.  It seemed \nthat he had several times opened his mouth when alone with Richard \nafter dinner, as if he had something on his mind, but had always \nshut it again, to Richard\'s extreme confusion, without saying \nanything.\n\nMrs. Jellyby, sitting in quite a nest of waste paper, drank coffee \nall the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter.  \nShe also held a discussion with Mr. Quale, of which the subject \nseemed to be--if I understood it--the brotherhood of humanity, and \ngave utterance to some beautiful sentiments.  I was not so \nattentive an auditor as I might have wished to be, however, for \nPeepy and the other children came flocking about Ada and me in a \ncorner of the drawing-room to ask for another story; so we sat down \namong them and told them in whispers \"Puss in Boots\" and I don\'t \nknow what else until Mrs. Jellyby, accidentally remembering them, \nsent them to bed.  As Peepy cried for me to take him to bed, I \ncarried him upstairs, where the young woman with the flannel \nbandage charged into the midst of the little family like a dragon \nand overturned them into cribs.\n\nAfter that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and \nin coaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn, which \nat last it did, quite brightly.  On my return downstairs, I felt \nthat Mrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so \nfrivolous, and I was sorry for it, though at the same time I knew \nthat I had no higher pretensions.\n\nIt was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to \nbed, and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking \ncoffee and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of her pen.\n\n\"What a strange house!\" said Ada when we got upstairs.  \"How \ncurious of my cousin Jarndyce to send us here!\"\n\n\"My love,\" said I, \"it quite confuses me.  I want to understand it, \nand I can\'t understand it at all.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Ada with her pretty smile.\n\n\"All this, my dear,\" said I.  \"It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby \nto take such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives--and \nyet--Peepy and the housekeeping!\"\n\nAda laughed and put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the \nfire, and told me I was a quiet, dear, good creature and had won \nher heart.  \"You are so thoughtful, Esther,\" she said, \"and yet so \ncheerful!  And you do so much, so unpretendingly!  You would make a \nhome out of even this house.\"\n\nMy simple darling!  She was quite unconscious that she only praised \nherself and that it was in the goodness of her own heart that she \nmade so much of me!\n\n\"May I ask you a question?\" said I when we had sat before the fire \na little while.\n\n\"Five hundred,\" said Ada.\n\n\"Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce.  I owe so much to him.  Would you mind \ndescribing him to me?\"\n\nShaking her golden hair, Ada turned her eyes upon me with such \nlaughing wonder that I was full of wonder too, partly at her \nbeauty, partly at her surprise.\n\n\"Esther!\" she cried.\n\n\"My dear!\"\n\n\"You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce?\"\n\n\"My dear, I never saw him.\"\n\n\"And I never saw him!\" returned Ada.\n\nWell, to be sure!\n\nNo, she had never seen him.  Young as she was when her mama died, \nshe remembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she \nspoke of him and of the noble generosity of his character, which \nshe had said was to be trusted above all earthly things; and Ada \ntrusted it.  Her cousin Jarndyce had written to her a few months \nago--\"a plain, honest letter,\" Ada said--proposing the arrangement \nwe were now to enter on and telling her that \"in time it might heal \nsome of the wounds made by the miserable Chancery suit.\"  She had \nreplied, gratefully accepting his proposal.  Richard had received a \nsimilar letter and had made a similar response.  He HAD seen Mr. \nJarndyce once, but only once, five years ago, at Winchester school.  \nHe had told Ada, when they were leaning on the screen before the \nfire where I found them, that he recollected him as \"a bluff, rosy \nfellow.\"  This was the utmost description Ada could give me.\n\nIt set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep, I still remained \nbefore the fire, wondering and wondering about Bleak House, and \nwondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long \nago.  I don\'t know where my thoughts had wandered when they were \nrecalled by a tap at the door.\n\nI opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a \nbroken candle in a broken candlestick in one hand and an egg-cup in \nthe other.\n\n\"Good night!\" she said very sulkily.\n\n\"Good night!\" said I.\n\n\"May I come in?\" she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same \nsulky way.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said I.  \"Don\'t wake Miss Clare.\"\n\nShe would not sit down, but stood by the fire dipping her inky \nmiddle finger in the egg-cup, which contained vinegar, and smearing \nit over the ink stains on her face, frowning the whole time and \nlooking very gloomy.\n\n\"I wish Africa was dead!\" she said on a sudden.\n\nI was going to remonstrate.\n\n\"I do!\" she said \"Don\'t talk to me, Miss Summerson.  I hate it and \ndetest it.  It\'s a beast!\"\n\nI told her she was tired, and I was sorry.  I put my hand upon her \nhead, and touched her forehead, and said it was hot now but would \nbe cool tomorrow.  She still stood pouting and frowning at me, but \npresently put down her egg-cup and turned softly towards the bed \nwhere Ada lay.\n\n\"She is very pretty!\" she said with the same knitted brow and in \nthe same uncivil manner.\n\nI assented with a smile.\n\n\"An orphan.  Ain\'t she?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But knows a quantity, I suppose?  Can dance, and play music, and \nsing?  She can talk French, I suppose, and do geography, and \nglobes, and needlework, and everything?\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said I.\n\n\"I can\'t,\" she returned.  \"I can\'t do anything hardly, except \nwrite.  I\'m always writing for Ma.  I wonder you two were not \nashamed of yourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to \ndo nothing else.  It was like your ill nature.  Yet you think \nyourselves very fine, I dare say!\"\n\nI could see that the poor girl was near crying, and I resumed my \nchair without speaking and looked at her (I hope) as mildly as I \nfelt towards her.\n\n\"It\'s disgraceful,\" she said.  \"You know it is.  The whole house is \ndisgraceful.  The children are disgraceful.  I\'M disgraceful.  Pa\'s \nmiserable, and no wonder!  Priscilla drinks--she\'s always drinking.  \nIt\'s a great shame and a great story of you if you say you didn\'t \nsmell her today.  It was as bad as a public-house, waiting at \ndinner; you know it was!\"\n\n\"My dear, I don\'t know it,\" said I.\n\n\"You do,\" she said very shortly.  \"You shan\'t say you don\'t.  You \ndo!\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" said I.  \"If you won\'t let me speak--\"\n\n\"You\'re speaking now.  You know you are.  Don\'t tell stories, Miss \nSummerson.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said I, \"as long as you won\'t hear me out--\"\n\n\"I don\'t want to hear you out.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I think you do,\" said I, \"because that would be so very \nunreasonable.  I did not know what you tell me because the servant \ndid not come near me at dinner; but I don\'t doubt what you tell me, \nand I am sorry to hear it.\"\n\n\"You needn\'t make a merit of that,\" said she.\n\n\"No, my dear,\" said I.  \"That would be very foolish.\"\n\nShe was still standing by the bed, and now stooped down (but still \nwith the same discontented face) and kissed Ada.  That done, she \ncame softly back and stood by the side of my chair.  Her bosom was \nheaving in a distressful manner that I greatly pitied, but I \nthought it better not to speak.\n\n\"I wish I was dead!\" she broke out.  \"I wish we were all dead.  It \nwould be a great deal better for us.\n\nIn a moment afterwards, she knelt on the ground at my side, hid her \nface in my dress, passionately begged my pardon, and wept.  I \ncomforted her and would have raised her, but she cried no, no; she \nwanted to stay there!\n\n\"You used to teach girls,\" she said, \"If you could only have taught \nme, I could have learnt from you!  I am so very miserable, and I \nlike you so much!\"\n\nI could not persuade her to sit by me or to do anything but move a \nragged stool to where she was kneeling, and take that, and still \nhold my dress in the same manner.  By degrees the poor tired girl \nfell asleep, and then I contrived to raise her head so that it \nshould rest on my lap, and to cover us both with shawls.  The fire \nwent out, and all night long she slumbered thus before the ashy \ngrate.  At first I was painfully awake and vainly tried to lose \nmyself, with my eyes closed, among the scenes of the day.  At \nlength, by slow degrees, they became indistinct and mingled.  I \nbegan to lose the identity of the sleeper resting on me.  Now it \nwas Ada, now one of my old Reading friends from whom I could not \nbelieve I had so recently parted.  Now it was the little mad woman \nworn out with curtsying and smiling, now some one in authority at \nBleak House.  Lastly, it was no one, and I was no one.\n\nThe purblind day was feebly struggling with the fog when I opened \nmy eyes to encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed \nupon me.  Peepy had scaled his crib, and crept down in his bed-gown \nand cap, and was so cold that his teeth were chattering as if he \nhad cut them all.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nA Morning Adventure\n\n\nAlthough the morning was raw, and although the fog still seemed \nheavy--I say seemed, for the windows were so encrusted with dirt \nthat they would have made midsummer sunshine dim--I was \nsufficiently forewarned of the discomfort within doors at that \nearly hour and sufficiently curious about London to think it a good \nidea on the part of Miss Jellyby when she proposed that we should \ngo out for a walk.\n\n\"Ma won\'t be down for ever so long,\" she said, \"and then it\'s a \nchance if breakfast\'s ready for an hour afterwards, they dawdle so.  \nAs to Pa, he gets what he can and goes to the office.  He never has \nwhat you would call a regular breakfast.  Priscilla leaves him out \nthe loaf and some milk, when there is any, overnight.  Sometimes \nthere isn\'t any milk, and sometimes the cat drinks it.  But I\'m \nafraid you must be tired, Miss Summerson, and perhaps you would \nrather go to bed.\"\n\n\"I am not at all tired, my dear,\" said I, \"and would much prefer to \ngo out.\"\n\n\"If you\'re sure you would,\" returned Miss Jellyby, \"I\'ll get my \nthings on.\"\n\nAda said she would go too, and was soon astir.  I made a proposal \nto Peepy, in default of being able to do anything better for him, \nthat he should let me wash him and afterwards lay him down on my \nbed again.  To this he submitted with the best grace possible, \nstaring at me during the whole operation as if he never had been, \nand never could again be, so astonished in his life--looking very \nmiserable also, certainly, but making no complaint, and going \nsnugly to sleep as soon as it was over.  At first I was in two \nminds about taking such a liberty, but I soon reflected that nobody \nin the house was likely to notice it.\n\nWhat with the bustle of dispatching Peepy and the bustle of getting \nmyself ready and helping Ada, I was soon quite in a glow.  We found \nMiss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in the writing-\nroom, which Priscilla was then lighting with a smutty parlour \ncandlestick, throwing the candle in to make it burn better.  \nEverything was just as we had left it last night and was evidently \nintended to remain so.  Below-stairs the dinner-cloth had not been \ntaken away, but had been left ready for breakfast.  Crumbs, dust, \nand waste-paper were all over the house.  Some pewter pots and a \nmilk-can hung on the area railings; the door stood open; and we met \nthe cook round the corner coming out of a public-house, wiping her \nmouth.  She mentioned, as she passed us, that she had been to see \nwhat o\'clock it was.\n\nBut before we met the cook, we met Richard, who was dancing up and \ndown Thavies Inn to warm his feet.  He was agreeably surprised to \nsee us stirring so soon and said he would gladly share our walk.  \nSo he took care of Ada, and Miss Jellyby and I went first.  I may \nmention that Miss Jellyby had relapsed into her sulky manner and \nthat I really should not have thought she liked me much unless she \nhad told me so.\n\n\"Where would you wish to go?\" she asked.\n\n\"Anywhere, my dear,\" I replied.\n\n\"Anywhere\'s nowhere,\" said Miss Jellyby, stopping perversely.\n\n\"Let us go somewhere at any rate,\" said I.\n\nShe then walked me on very fast.\n\n\"I don\'t care!\" she said.  \"Now, you are my witness, Miss \nSummerson, I say I don\'t care-but if he was to come to our house \nwith his great, shining, lumpy forehead night after night till he \nwas as old as Methuselah, I wouldn\'t have anything to say to him.  \nSuch ASSES as he and Ma make of themselves!\"\n\n\"My dear!\" I remonstrated, in allusion to the epithet and the \nvigorous emphasis Miss Jellyby set upon it.  \"Your duty as a child--\"\n\n\"Oh!  Don\'t talk of duty as a child, Miss Summerson; where\'s Ma\'s \nduty as a parent?  All made over to the public and Africa, I \nsuppose!  Then let the public and Africa show duty as a child; it\'s \nmuch more their affair than mine.  You are shocked, I dare say!  \nVery well, so am I shocked too; so we are both shocked, and there\'s \nan end of it!\"\n\nShe walked me on faster yet.\n\n\"But for all that, I say again, he may come, and come, and come, \nand I won\'t have anything to say to him.  I can\'t bear him.  If \nthere\'s any stuff in the world that I hate and detest, it\'s the \nstuff he and Ma talk.  I wonder the very paving-stones opposite our \nhouse can have the patience to stay there and be a witness of such \ninconsistencies and contradictions as all that sounding nonsense, \nand Ma\'s management!\"\n\nI could not but understand her to refer to Mr. Quale, the young \ngentleman who had appeared after dinner yesterday.  I was saved the \ndisagreeable necessity of pursuing the subject by Richard and Ada \ncoming up at a round pace, laughing and asking us if we meant to \nrun a race.  Thus interrupted, Miss Jellyby became silent and \nwalked moodily on at my side while I admired the long successions \nand varieties of streets, the quantity of people already going to \nand fro, the number of vehicles passing and repassing, the busy \npreparations in the setting forth of shop windows and the sweeping \nout of shops, and the extraordinary creatures in rags secretly \ngroping among the swept-out rubbish for pins and other refuse.\n\n\"So, cousin,\" said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me.  \n\"We are never to get out of Chancery!  We have come by another way \nto our place of meeting yesterday, and--by the Great Seal, here\'s \nthe old lady again!\"\n\nTruly, there she was, immediately in front of us, curtsying, and \nsmiling, and saying with her yesterday\'s air of patronage, \"The \nwards in Jarndyce!  Ve-ry happy, I am sure!\"\n\n\"You are out early, ma\'am,\" said I as she curtsied to me.\n\n\"Ye-es!  I usually walk here early.  Before the court sits.  It\'s \nretired.  I collect my thoughts here for the business of the day,\" \nsaid the old lady mincingly.  \"The business of the day requires a \ngreat deal of thought.  Chancery justice is so ve-ry difficult to \nfollow.\"\n\n\"Who\'s this, Miss Summerson?\" whispered Miss Jellyby, drawing my \narm tighter through her own.\n\nThe little old lady\'s hearing was remarkably quick.  She answered \nfor herself directly.\n\n\"A suitor, my child.  At your service.  I have the honour to attend \ncourt regularly.  With my documents.  Have I the pleasure of \naddressing another of the youthful parties in Jarndyce?\" said the \nold lady, recovering herself, with her head on one side, from a \nvery low curtsy.\n\nRichard, anxious to atone for his thoughtlessness of yesterday, \ngood-naturedly explained that Miss Jellyby was not connected with \nthe suit.\n\n\"Ha!\" said the old lady.  \"She does not expect a judgment?  She \nwill still grow old.  But not so old.  Oh, dear, no!  This is the \ngarden of Lincoln\'s Inn.  I call it my garden.  It is quite a bower \nin the summer-time.  Where the birds sing melodiously.  I pass the \ngreater part of the long vacation here.  In contemplation.  You \nfind the long vacation exceedingly long, don\'t you?\"\n\nWe said yes, as she seemed to expect us to say so.\n\n\"When the leaves are falling from the trees and there are no more \nflowers in bloom to make up into nosegays for the Lord Chancellor\'s \ncourt,\" said the old lady, \"the vacation is fulfilled and the sixth \nseal, mentioned in the Revelations, again prevails.  Pray come and \nsee my lodging.  It will be a good omen for me.  Youth, and hope, \nand beauty are very seldom there.  It is a long, long time since I \nhad a visit from either.\"\n\nShe had taken my hand, and leading me and Miss Jellyby away, \nbeckoned Richard and Ada to come too.  I did not know how to excuse \nmyself and looked to Richard for aid.  As he was half amused and \nhalf curious and all in doubt how to get rid of the old lady \nwithout offence, she continued to lead us away, and he and Ada \ncontinued to follow, our strange conductress informing us all the \ntime, with much smiling condescension, that she lived close by.\n\nIt was quite true, as it soon appeared.  She lived so close by that \nwe had not time to have done humouring her for a few moments before \nshe was at home.  Slipping us out at a little side gate, the old \nlady stopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street, part of \nsome courts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn, and \nsaid, \"This is my lodging.  Pray walk up!\"\n\nShe had stopped at a shop over which was written KROOK, RAG AND \nBOTTLE WAREHOUSE.  Also, in long thin letters, KROOK, DEALER IN \nMARINE STORES.  In one part of the window was a picture of a red \npaper mill at which a cart was unloading a quantity of sacks of old \nrags.  In another was the inscription BONES BOUGHT.  In another, \nKITCHEN-STUFF BOUGHT.  In another, OLD IRON BOUGHT.  In another, \nWASTE-PAPER BOUGHT.  In another, LADIES\' AND GENTLEMEN\'S WARDROBES \nBOUGHT.  Everything seemed to be bought and nothing to be sold \nthere.  In all parts of the window were quantities of dirty \nbottles--blacking bottles, medicine bottles, ginger-beer and soda-\nwater bottles, pickle bottles, wine bottles, ink bottles; I am \nreminded by mentioning the latter that the shop had in several \nlittle particulars the air of being in a legal neighbourhood and of \nbeing, as it were, a dirty hanger-on and disowned relation of the \nlaw.  There were a great many ink bottles.  There was a little \ntottering bench of shabby old volumes outside the door, labelled \n\"Law Books, all at 9d.\"  Some of the inscriptions I have enumerated \nwere written in law-hand, like the papers I had seen in Kenge and \nCarboy\'s office and the letters I had so long received from the \nfirm.  Among them was one, in the same writing, having nothing to \ndo with the business of the shop, but announcing that a respectable \nman aged forty-five wanted engrossing or copying to execute with \nneatness and dispatch: Address to Nemo, care of Mr. Krook, within.  \nThere were several second-hand bags, blue and red, hanging up.  A \nlittle way within the shop-door lay heaps of old crackled parchment \nscrolls and discoloured and dog\'s-eared law-papers.  I could have \nfancied that all the rusty keys, of which there must have been \nhundreds huddled together as old iron, had once belonged to doors \nof rooms or strong chests in lawyers\' offices.  The litter of rags \ntumbled partly into and partly out of a one-legged wooden scale, \nhanging without any counterpoise from a beam, might have been \ncounsellors\' bands and gowns torn up.  One had only to fancy, as \nRichard whispered to Ada and me while we all stood looking in, that \nyonder bones in a corner, piled together and picked very clean, \nwere the bones of clients, to make the picture complete.\n\nAs it was still foggy and dark, and as the shop was blinded besides \nby the wall of Lincoln\'s Inn, intercepting the light within a \ncouple of yards, we should not have seen so much but for a lighted \nlantern that an old man in spectacles and a hairy cap was carrying \nabout in the shop.  Turning towards the door, he now caught sight \nof us.  He was short, cadaverous, and withered, with his head sunk \nsideways between his shoulders and the breath issuing in visible \nsmoke from his mouth as if he were on fire within.  His throat, \nchin, and eyebrows were so frosted with white hairs and so gnarled \nwith veins and puckered skin that he looked from his breast upward \nlike some old root in a fall of snow.\n\n\"Hi, hi!\" said the old man, coming to the door.  \"Have you anything \nto sell?\"\n\nWe naturally drew back and glanced at our conductress, who had been \ntrying to open the house-door with a key she had taken from her \npocket, and to whom Richard now said that as we had had the \npleasure of seeing where she lived, we would leave her, being \npressed for time.  But she was not to be so easily left.  She \nbecame so fantastically and pressingly earnest in her entreaties \nthat we would walk up and see her apartment for an instant, and was \nso bent, in her harmless way, on leading me in, as part of the good \nomen she desired, that I (whatever the others might do) saw nothing \nfor it but to comply.  I suppose we were all more or less curious; \nat any rate, when the old man added his persuasions to hers and \nsaid, \"Aye, aye!  Please her!  It won\'t take a minute!  Come in, \ncome in!  Come in through the shop if t\'other door\'s out of order!\" \nwe all went in, stimulated by Richard\'s laughing encouragement and \nrelying on his protection.\n\n\"My landlord, Krook,\" said the little old lady, condescending to \nhim from her lofty station as she presented him to us.  \"He is \ncalled among the neighbours the Lord Chancellor.  His shop is \ncalled the Court of Chancery.  He is a very eccentric person.  He \nis very odd.  Oh, I assure you he is very odd!\"\n\nShe shook her head a great many times and tapped her forehead with \nher finger to express to us that we must have the goodness to \nexcuse him, \"For he is a little--you know--M!\" said the old lady \nwith great stateliness.  The old man overheard, and laughed.\n\n\"It\'s true enough,\" he said, going before us with the lantern, \n\"that they call me the lord chancellor and call my shop Chancery.  \nAnd why do you think they call me the Lord Chancellor and my shop \nChancery?\"\n\n\"I don\'t know, I am sure!\" said Richard rather carelessly.\n\n\"You see,\" said the old man, stopping and turning round, \"they--Hi!  \nHere\'s lovely hair!  I have got three sacks of ladies\' hair below, \nbut none so beautiful and fine as this.  What colour, and what \ntexture!\"\n\n\"That\'ll do, my good friend!\" said Richard, strongly disapproving \nof his having drawn one of Ada\'s tresses through his yellow hand.  \n\"You can admire as the rest of us do without taking that liberty.\"\n\nThe old man darted at him a sudden look which even called my \nattention from Ada, who, startled and blushing, was so remarkably \nbeautiful that she seemed to fix the wandering attention of the \nlittle old lady herself.  But as Ada interposed and laughingly said \nshe could only feel proud of such genuine admiration, Mr. Krook \nshrunk into his former self as suddenly as he had leaped out of it.\n\n\"You see, I have so many things here,\" he resumed, holding up the \nlantern, \"of so many kinds, and all as the neighbours think (but \nTHEY know nothing), wasting away and going to rack and ruin, that \nthat\'s why they have given me and my place a christening.  And I \nhave so many old parchmentses and papers in my stock.  And I have a \nliking for rust and must and cobwebs.  And all\'s fish that comes to \nmy net.  And I can\'t abear to part with anything I once lay hold of \n(or so my neighbours think, but what do THEY know?) or to alter \nanything, or to have any sweeping, nor scouring, nor cleaning, nor \nrepairing going on about me.  That\'s the way I\'ve got the ill name \nof Chancery.  I don\'t mind.  I go to see my noble and learned \nbrother pretty well every day, when he sits in the Inn.  He don\'t \nnotice me, but I notice him.  There\'s no great odds betwixt us.  We \nboth grub on in a muddle.  Hi, Lady Jane!\"\n\nA large grey cat leaped from some neighbouring shelf on his \nshoulder and startled us all.\n\n\"Hi!  Show \'em how you scratch.  Hi!  Tear, my lady!\" said her \nmaster.\n\nThe cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her \ntigerish claws, with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear.\n\n\"She\'d do as much for any one I was to set her on,\" said the old \nman.  \"I deal in cat-skins among other general matters, and hers \nwas offered to me.  It\'s a very fine skin, as you may see, but I \ndidn\'t have it stripped off!  THAT warn\'t like Chancery practice \nthough, says you!\"\n\nHe had by this time led us across the shop, and now opened a door \nin the back part of it, leading to the house-entry.  As he stood \nwith his hand upon the lock, the little old lady graciously \nobserved to him before passing out, \"That will do, Krook.  You mean \nwell, but are tiresome.  My young friends are pressed for time.  I \nhave none to spare myself, having to attend court very soon.  My \nyoung friends are the wards in Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"Jarndyce!\" said the old man with a start.\n\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce.  The great suit, Krook,\" returned his \nlodger.\n\n\"Hi!\" exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and \nwith a wider stare than before.  \"Think of it!\"\n\nHe seemed so rapt all in a moment and looked so curiously at us \nthat Richard said, \"Why, you appear to trouble yourself a good deal \nabout the causes before your noble and learned brother, the other \nChancellor!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man abstractedly.  \"Sure!  YOUR name now will \nbe--\"\n\n\"Richard Carstone.\"\n\n\"Carstone,\" he repeated, slowly checking off that name upon his \nforefinger; and each of the others he went on to mention upon a \nseparate finger.  \"Yes.  There was the name of Barbary, and the \nname of Clare, and the name of Dedlock, too, I think.\"\n\n\"He knows as much of the cause as the real salaried Chancellor!\" \nsaid Richard, quite astonished, to Ada and me.\n\n\"Aye!\" said the old man, coming slowly out of his abstraction.  \n\"Yes!  Tom Jarndyce--you\'ll excuse me, being related; but he was \nnever known about court by any other name, and was as well known \nthere as--she is now,\" nodding slightly at his lodger.  \"Tom \nJarndyce was often in here.  He got into a restless habit of \nstrolling about when the cause was on, or expected, talking to the \nlittle shopkeepers and telling \'em to keep out of Chancery, \nwhatever they did.  \'For,\' says he, \'it\'s being ground to bits in a \nslow mill; it\'s being roasted at a slow fire; it\'s being stung to \ndeath by single bees; it\'s being drowned by drops; it\'s going mad \nby grains.\'  He was as near making away with himself, just where \nthe young lady stands, as near could be.\"\n\nWe listened with horror.\n\n\"He come in at the door,\" said the old man, slowly pointing an \nimaginary track along the shop, \"on the day he did it--the whole \nneighbourhood had said for months before that he would do it, of a \ncertainty sooner or later--he come in at the door that day, and \nwalked along there, and sat himself on a bench that stood there, \nand asked me (you\'ll judge I was a mortal sight younger then) to \nfetch him a pint of wine.  \'For,\' says he, \'Krook, I am much \ndepressed; my cause is on again, and I think I\'m nearer judgment \nthan I ever was.\'  I hadn\'t a mind to leave him alone; and I \npersuaded him to go to the tavern over the way there, t\'other side \nmy lane (I mean Chancery Lane); and I followed and looked in at the \nwindow, and saw him, comfortable as I thought, in the arm-chair by \nthe fire, and company with him.  I hadn\'t hardly got back here when \nI heard a shot go echoing and rattling right away into the inn.  I \nran out--neighbours ran out--twenty of us cried at once, \'Tom \nJarndyce!\'\"\n\nThe old man stopped, looked hard at us, looked down into the \nlantern, blew the light out, and shut the lantern up.\n\n\"We were right, I needn\'t tell the present hearers.  Hi!  To be \nsure, how the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while \nthe cause was on!  How my noble and learned brother, and all the \nrest of \'em, grubbed and muddled away as usual and tried to look as \nif they hadn\'t heard a word of the last fact in the case or as if \nthey had--Oh, dear me!--nothing at all to do with it if they had \nheard of it by any chance!\"\n\nAda\'s colour had entirely left her, and Richard was scarcely less \npale.  Nor could I wonder, judging even from my emotions, and I was \nno party in the suit, that to hearts so untried and fresh it was a \nshock to come into the inheritance of a protracted misery, attended \nin the minds of many people with such dreadful recollections.  I \nhad another uneasiness, in the application of the painful story to \nthe poor half-witted creature who had brought us there; but, to my \nsurprise, she seemed perfectly unconscious of that and only led the \nway upstairs again, informing us with the toleration of a superior \ncreature for the infirmities of a common mortal that her landlord \nwas \"a little M, you know!\"\n\nShe lived at the top of the house, in a pretty large room, from \nwhich she had a glimpse of Lincoln\'s Inn Hall.  This seemed to have \nbeen her principal inducement, originally, for taking up her \nresidence there.  She could look at it, she said, in the night, \nespecially in the moonshine.  Her room was clean, but very, very \nbare.  I noticed the scantiest necessaries in the way of furniture; \na few old prints from books, of Chancellors and barristers, wafered \nagainst the wall; and some half-dozen reticles and work-bags, \n\"containing documents,\" as she informed us.  There were neither \ncoals nor ashes in the grate, and I saw no articles of clothing \nanywhere, nor any kind of food.  Upon a shelf in an open cupboard \nwere a plate or two, a cup or two, and so forth, but all dry and \nempty.  There was a more affecting meaning in her pinched \nappearance, I thought as I looked round, than I had understood \nbefore.\n\n\"Extremely honoured, I am sure,\" said our poor hostess with the \ngreatest suavity, \"by this visit from the wards in Jarndyce.  And \nvery much indebted for the omen.  It is a retired situation.  \nConsidering.  I am limited as to situation.  In consequence of the \nnecessity of attending on the Chancellor.  I have lived here many \nyears.  I pass my days in court, my evenings and my nights here.  I \nfind the nights long, for I sleep but little and think much.  That \nis, of course, unavoidable, being in Chancery.  I am sorry I cannot \noffer chocolate.  I expect a judgment shortly and shall then place \nmy establishment on a superior footing.  At present, I don\'t mind \nconfessing to the wards in Jarndyce (in strict confidence) that I \nsometimes find it difficult to keep up a genteel appearance.  I \nhave felt the cold here.  I have felt something sharper than cold.  \nIt matters very little.  Pray excuse the introduction of such mean \ntopics.\"\n\nShe partly drew aside the curtain of the long, low garret window \nand called our attention to a number of bird-cages hanging there, \nsome containing several birds.  There were larks, linnets, and \ngoldfinches--I should think at least twenty.\n\n\"I began to keep the little creatures,\" she said, \"with an object \nthat the wards will readily comprehend.  With the intention of \nrestoring them to liberty.  When my judgment should be given.  Ye-\nes!  They die in prison, though.  Their lives, poor silly things, \nare so short in comparison with Chancery proceedings that, one by \none, the whole collection has died over and over again.  I doubt, \ndo you know, whether one of these, though they are all young, will \nlive to be free!  Ve-ry mortifying, is it not?\"\n\nAlthough she sometimes asked a question, she never seemed to expect \na reply, but rambled on as if she were in the habit of doing so \nwhen no one but herself was present.\n\n\"Indeed,\" she pursued, \"I positively doubt sometimes, I do assure \nyou, whether while matters are still unsettled, and the sixth or \nGreat Seal still prevails, I may not one day be found lying stark \nand senseless here, as I have found so many birds!\"\n\nRichard, answering what he saw in Ada\'s compassionate eyes, took \nthe opportunity of laying some money, softly and unobserved, on the \nchimney-piece.  We all drew nearer to the cages, feigning to \nexamine the birds.\n\n\"I can\'t allow them to sing much,\" said the little old lady, \"for \n(you\'ll think this curious) I find my mind confused by the idea \nthat they are singing while I am following the arguments in court.  \nAnd my mind requires to be so very clear, you know!  Another time, \nI\'ll tell you their names.  Not at present.  On a day of such good \nomen, they shall sing as much as they like.  In honour of youth,\" a \nsmile and curtsy, \"hope,\" a smile and curtsy, \"and beauty,\" a smile \nand curtsy.  \"There!  We\'ll let in the full light.\"\n\nThe birds began to stir and chirp.\n\n\"I cannot admit the air freely,\" said the little old lady--the room \nwas close, and would have been the better for it--\"because the cat \nyou saw downstairs, called Lady Jane, is greedy for their lives.  \nShe crouches on the parapet outside for hours and hours.  I have \ndiscovered,\" whispering mysteriously, \"that her natural cruelty is \nsharpened by a jealous fear of their regaining their liberty.  In \nconsequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given.  She is \nsly and full of malice.  I half believe, sometimes, that she is no \ncat, but the wolf of the old saying.  It is so very difficult to \nkeep her from the door.\"\n\nSome neighbouring bells, reminding the poor soul that it was half-\npast nine, did more for us in the way of bringing our visit to an \nend than we could easily have done for ourselves.  She hurriedly \ntook up her little bag of documents, which she had laid upon the \ntable on coming in, and asked if we were also going into court.  On \nour answering no, and that we would on no account detain her, she \nopened the door to attend us downstairs.\n\n\"With such an omen, it is even more necessary than usual that I \nshould be there before the Chancellor comes in,\" said she, \"for he \nmight mention my case the first thing.  I have a presentiment that \nhe WILL mention it the first thing this morning\"\n\nShe stopped to tell us in a whisper as we were going down that the \nwhole house was filled with strange lumber which her landlord had \nbought piecemeal and had no wish to sell, in consequence of being a \nlittle M.  This was on the first floor.  But she had made a \nprevious stoppage on the second floor and had silently pointed at a \ndark door there.\n\n\"The only other lodger,\" she now whispered in explanation, \"a law-\nwriter.  The children in the lanes here say he has sold himself to \nthe devil.  I don\'t know what he can have done with the money.  \nHush!\"\n\nShe appeared to mistrust that the lodger might hear her even there, \nand repeating \"Hush!\" went before us on tiptoe as though even the \nsound of her footsteps might reveal to him what she had said.\n\nPassing through the shop on our way out, as we had passed through \nit on our way in, we found the old man storing a quantity of \npackets of waste-paper in a kind of well in the floor.  He seemed \nto be working hard, with the perspiration standing on his forehead, \nand had a piece of chalk by him, with which, as he put each \nseparate package or bundle down, he made a crooked mark on the \npanelling of the wall.\n\nRichard and Ada, and Miss Jellyby, and the little old lady had gone \nby him, and I was going when he touched me on the arm to stay me, \nand chalked the letter J upon the wall--in a very curious manner, \nbeginning with the end of the letter and shaping it backward.  It \nwas a capital letter, not a printed one, but just such a letter as \nany clerk in Messrs. Kenge and Carboy\'s office would have made.\n\n\"Can you read it?\" he asked me with a keen glance.\n\n\"Surely,\" said I.  \"It\'s very plain.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"J.\"\n\nWith another glance at me, and a glance at the door, he rubbed it \nout and turned an \"a\" in its place (not a capital letter this \ntime), and said, \"What\'s that?\"\n\nI told him.  He then rubbed that out and turned the letter \"r,\" and \nasked me the same question.  He went on quickly until he had formed \nin the same curious manner, beginning at the ends and bottoms of \nthe letters, the word Jarndyce, without once leaving two letters on \nthe wall together.\n\n\"What does that spell?\" he asked me.\n\nWhen I told him, he laughed.  In the same odd way, yet with the \nsame rapidity, he then produced singly, and rubbed out singly, the \nletters forming the words Bleak House.  These, in some \nastonishment, I also read; and he laughed again.\n\n\"Hi!\" said the old man, laying aside the chalk.  \"I have a turn for \ncopying from memory, you see, miss, though I can neither read nor \nwrite.\"\n\nHe looked so disagreeable and his cat looked so wickedly at me, as \nif I were a blood-relation of the birds upstairs, that I was quite \nrelieved by Richard\'s appearing at the door and saying, \"Miss \nSummerson, I hope you are not bargaining for the sale of your hair.  \nDon\'t be tempted.  Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr. Krook!\"\n\nI lost no time in wishing Mr. Krook good morning and joining my \nfriends outside, where we parted with the little old lady, who gave \nus her blessing with great ceremony and renewed her assurance of \nyesterday in reference to her intention of settling estates on Ada \nand me.  Before we finally turned out of those lanes, we looked \nback and saw Mr. Krook standing at his shop-door, in his \nspectacles, looking after us, with his cat upon his shoulder, and \nher tail sticking up on one side of his hairy cap like a tall \nfeather.\n\n\"Quite an adventure for a morning in London!\" said Richard with a \nsigh.  \"Ah, cousin, cousin, it\'s a weary word this Chancery!\"\n\n\"It is to me, and has been ever since I can remember,\" returned \nAda.  \"I am grieved that I should be the enemy---as I suppose I am\n--of a great number of relations and others, and that they should be \nmy enemies--as I suppose they are--and that we should all be \nruining one another without knowing how or why and be in constant \ndoubt and discord all our lives.  It seems very strange, as there \nmust be right somewhere, that an honest judge in real earnest has \nnot been able to find out through all these years where it is.\"\n\n\"Ah, cousin!\" said Richard.  \"Strange, indeed!  All this wasteful, \nwanton chess-playing IS very strange.  To see that composed court \nyesterday jogging on so serenely and to think of the wretchedness \nof the pieces on the board gave me the headache and the heartache \nboth together.  My head ached with wondering how it happened, if \nmen were neither fools nor rascals; and my heart ached to think \nthey could possibly be either.  But at all events, Ada--I may call \nyou Ada?\"\n\n\"Of course you may, cousin Richard.\"\n\n\"At all events, Chancery will work none of its bad influences on \nUS.  We have happily been brought together, thanks to our good \nkinsman, and it can\'t divide us now!\"\n\n\"Never, I hope, cousin Richard!\" said Ada gently.\n\nMiss Jellyby gave my arm a squeeze and me a very significant look.  \nI smiled in return, and we made the rest of the way back very \npleasantly.\n\nIn half an hour after our arrival, Mrs. Jellyby appeared; and in \nthe course of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast \nstraggled one by one into the dining-room.  I do not doubt that \nMrs. Jellyby had gone to bed and got up in the usual manner, but \nshe presented no appearance of having changed her dress.  She was \ngreatly occupied during breakfast, for the morning\'s post brought a \nheavy correspondence relative to Borrioboola-Gha, which would \noccasion her (she said) to pass a busy day.  The children tumbled \nabout, and notched memoranda of their accidents in their legs, \nwhich were perfect little calendars of distress; and Peepy was lost \nfor an hour and a half, and brought home from Newgate market by a \npoliceman.  The equable manner in which Mrs. Jellyby sustained both \nhis absence and his restoration to the family circle surprised us \nall.\n\nShe was by that time perseveringly dictating to Caddy, and Caddy \nwas fast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found \nher.  At one o\'clock an open carriage arrived for us, and a cart \nfor our luggage.  Mrs. Jellyby charged us with many remembrances to \nher good friend Mr. Jarndyce; Caddy left her desk to see us depart, \nkissed me in the passage, and stood biting her pen and sobbing on \nthe steps; Peepy, I am happy to say, was asleep and spared the pain \nof separation (I was not without misgivings that he had gone to \nNewgate market in search of me); and all the other children got up \nbehind the barouche and fell off, and we saw them, with great \nconcern, scattered over the surface of Thavies Inn as we rolled out \nof its precincts.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nQuite at Home\n\n\nThe day had brightened very much, and still brightened as we went \nwestward.  We went our way through the sunshine and the fresh air, \nwondering more and more at the extent of the streets, the \nbrilliancy of the shops, the great traffic, and the crowds of \npeople whom the pleasanter weather seemed to have brought out like \nmany-coloured flowers.  By and by we began to leave the wonderful \ncity and to proceed through suburbs which, of themselves, would \nhave made a pretty large town in my eyes; and at last we got into a \nreal country road again, with windmills, rick-yards, milestones, \nfarmers\' waggons, scents of old hay, swinging signs, and horse \ntroughs: trees, fields, and hedge-rows.  It was delightful to see \nthe green landscape before us and the immense metropolis behind; \nand when a waggon with a train of beautiful horses, furnished with \nred trappings and clear-sounding bells, came by us with its music, \nI believe we could all three have sung to the bells, so cheerful \nwere the influences around.\n\n\"The whole road has been reminding me of my name-sake Whittington,\" \nsaid Richard, \"and that waggon is the finishing touch.  Halloa!  \nWhat\'s the matter?\"\n\nWe had stopped, and the waggon had stopped too.  Its music changed \nas the horses came to a stand, and subsided to a gentle tinkling, \nexcept when a horse tossed his head or shook himself and sprinkled \noff a little shower of bell-ringing.\n\n\"Our postilion is looking after the waggoner,\" said Richard, \"and \nthe waggoner is coming back after us.  Good day, friend!\"  The \nwaggoner was at our coach-door.  \"Why, here\'s an extraordinary \nthing!\" added Richard, looking closely at the man.  \"He has got \nyour name, Ada, in his hat!\"\n\nHe had all our names in his hat.  Tucked within the band were three \nsmall notes--one addressed to Ada, one to Richard, one to me.  \nThese the waggoner delivered to each of us respectively, reading \nthe name aloud first.  In answer to Richard\'s inquiry from whom \nthey came, he briefly answered, \"Master, sir, if you please\"; and \nputting on his hat again (which was like a soft bowl), cracked his \nwhip, re-awakened his music, and went melodiously away.\n\n\"Is that Mr. Jarndyce\'s waggon?\" said Richard, calling to our post-\nboy.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied.  \"Going to London.\"\n\nWe opened the notes.  Each was a counterpart of the other and \ncontained these words in a solid, plain hand.\n\n\n\"I look forward, my dear, to our meeting easily and without \nconstraint on either side.  I therefore have to propose that we \nmeet as old friends and take the past for granted.  It will be a \nrelief to you possibly, and to me certainly, and so my love to you.\n\nJohn Jarndyce\"\n\n\nI had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my \ncompanions, having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one \nwho had been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence through so \nmany years.  I had not considered how I could thank him, my \ngratitude lying too deep in my heart for that; but I now began to \nconsider how I could meet him without thanking him, and felt it \nwould be very difficult indeed.\n\nThe notes revived in Richard and Ada a general impression that they \nboth had, without quite knowing how they came by it, that their \ncousin Jarndyce could never bear acknowledgments for any kindness \nhe performed and that sooner than receive any he would resort to \nthe most singular expedients and evasions or would even run away.  \nAda dimly remembered to have heard her mother tell, when she was a \nvery little child, that he had once done her an act of uncommon \ngenerosity and that on her going to his house to thank him, he \nhappened to see her through a window coming to the door, and \nimmediately escaped by the back gate, and was not heard of for \nthree months.  This discourse led to a great deal more on the same \ntheme, and indeed it lasted us all day, and we talked of scarcely \nanything else.  If we did by any chance diverge into another \nsubject, we soon returned to this, and wondered what the house \nwould be like, and when we should get there, and whether we should \nsee Mr. Jarndyce as soon as we arrived or after a delay, and what \nhe would say to us, and what we should say to him.  All of which we \nwondered about, over and over again.\n\nThe roads were very heavy for the horses, but the pathway was \ngenerally good, so we alighted and walked up all the hills, and \nliked it so well that we prolonged our walk on the level ground \nwhen we got to the top.  At Barnet there were other horses waiting \nfor us, but as they had only just been fed, we had to wait for them \ntoo, and got a long fresh walk over a common and an old battle-\nfield before the carriage came up.  These delays so protracted the \njourney that the short day was spent and the long night had closed \nin before we came to St. Albans, near to which town Bleak House \nwas, we knew.\n\nBy that time we were so anxious and nervous that even Richard \nconfessed, as we rattled over the stones of the old street, to \nfeeling an irrational desire to drive back again.  As to Ada and \nme, whom he had wrapped up with great care, the night being sharp \nand frosty, we trembled from head to foot.  When we turned out of \nthe town, round a corner, and Richard told us that the post-boy, \nwho had for a long time sympathized with our heightened \nexpectation, was looking back and nodding, we both stood up in the \ncarriage (Richard holding Ada lest she should be jolted down) and \ngazed round upon the open country and the starlight night for our \ndestination.  There was a light sparkling on the top of a hill \nbefore us, and the driver, pointing to it with his whip and crying, \n\"That\'s Bleak House!\" put his horses into a canter and took us \nforward at such a rate, uphill though it was, that the wheels sent \nthe road drift flying about our heads like spray from a water-mill.  \nPresently we lost the light, presently saw it, presently lost it, \npresently saw it, and turned into an avenue of trees and cantered \nup towards where it was beaming brightly.  It was in a window of \nwhat seemed to be an old-fashioned house with three peaks in the \nroof in front and a circular sweep leading to the porch.  A bell \nwas rung as we drew up, and amidst the sound of its deep voice in \nthe still air, and the distant barking of some dogs, and a gush of \nlight from the opened door, and the smoking and steaming of the \nheated horses, and the quickened beating of our own hearts, we \nalighted in no inconsiderable confusion.\n\n\"Ada, my love, Esther, my dear, you are welcome.  I rejoice to see \nyou!  Rick, if I had a hand to spare at present, I would give it \nyou!\"\n\nThe gentleman who said these words in a clear, bright, hospitable \nvoice had one of his arms round Ada\'s waist and the other round \nmine, and kissed us both in a fatherly way, and bore us across the \nhall into a ruddy little room, all in a glow with a blazing fire.  \nHere he kissed us again, and opening his arms, made us sit down \nside by side on a sofa ready drawn out near the hearth.  I felt \nthat if we had been at all demonstrative, he would have run away in \na moment.\n\n\"Now, Rick!\" said he.  \"I have a hand at liberty.  A word in \nearnest is as good as a speech.  I am heartily glad to see you.  \nYou are at home.  Warm yourself!\"\n\nRichard shook him by both hands with an intuitive mixture of \nrespect and frankness, and only saying (though with an earnestness \nthat rather alarmed me, I was so afraid of Mr. Jarndyce\'s suddenly \ndisappearing), \"You are very kind, sir!  We are very much obliged \nto you!\" laid aside his hat and coat and came up to the fire.\n\n\"And how did you like the ride?  And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby, \nmy dear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce to Ada.\n\nWhile Ada was speaking to him in reply, I glanced (I need not say \nwith how much interest) at his face.  It was a handsome, lively, \nquick face, full of change and motion; and his hair was a silvered \niron-grey.  I took him to be nearer sixty than fifty, but he was \nupright, hearty, and robust.  From the moment of his first speaking \nto us his voice had connected itself with an association in my mind \nthat I could not define; but now, all at once, a something sudden \nin his manner and a pleasant expression in his eyes recalled the \ngentleman in the stagecoach six years ago on the memorable day of \nmy journey to Reading.  I was certain it was he.  I never was so \nfrightened in my life as when I made the discovery, for he caught \nmy glance, and appearing to read my thoughts, gave such a look at \nthe door that I thought we had lost him.\n\nHowever, I am happy to say he remained where he was, and asked me \nwhat I thought of Mrs. Jellyby.\n\n\"She exerts herself very much for Africa, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"Nobly!\" returned Mr. Jarndyce.  \"But you answer like Ada.\"  Whom I \nhad not heard.  \"You all think something else, I see.\"\n\n\"We rather thought,\" said I, glancing at Richard and Ada, who \nentreated me with their eyes to speak, \"that perhaps she was a \nlittle unmindful of her home.\"\n\n\"Floored!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce.\n\nI was rather alarmed again.\n\n\"Well!  I want to know your real thoughts, my dear.  I may have \nsent you there on purpose.\"\n\n\"We thought that, perhaps,\" said I, hesitating, \"it is right to \nbegin with the obligations of home, sir; and that, perhaps, while \nthose are overlooked and neglected, no other duties can possibly be \nsubstituted for them.\"\n\n\"The little Jellybys,\" said Richard, coming to my relief, \"are \nreally--I can\'t help expressing myself strongly, sir--in a devil of \na state.\"\n\n\"She means well,\" said Mr. Jarndyce hastily.  \"The wind\'s in the \neast.\"\n\n\"It was in the north, sir, as we came down,\" observed Richard.\n\n\"My dear Rick,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, poking the fire, \"I\'ll take an \noath it\'s either in the east or going to be.  I am always conscious \nof an uncomfortable sensation now and then when the wind is blowing \nin the east.\"\n\n\"Rheumatism, sir?\" said Richard.\n\n\"I dare say it is, Rick.  I believe it is.  And so the little Jell\n--I had my doubts about \'em--are in a--oh, Lord, yes, it\'s \neasterly!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\nHe had taken two or three undecided turns up and down while \nuttering these broken sentences, retaining the poker in one hand \nand rubbing his hair with the other, with a good-natured vexation \nat once so whimsical and so lovable that I am sure we were more \ndelighted with him than we could possibly have expressed in any \nwords.  He gave an arm to Ada and an arm to me, and bidding Richard \nbring a candle, was leading the way out when he suddenly turned us \nall back again.\n\n\"Those little Jellybys.  Couldn\'t you--didn\'t you--now, if it had \nrained sugar-plums, or three-cornered raspberry tarts, or anything \nof that sort!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Oh, cousin--\" Ada hastily began.\n\n\"Good, my pretty pet.  I like cousin.  Cousin John, perhaps, is \nbetter.\"\n\n\"Then, cousin John--\" Ada laughingly began again.\n\n\"Ha, ha!  Very good indeed!\" said Mr. Jarndyce with great \nenjoyment.  \"Sounds uncommonly natural.  Yes, my dear?\"\n\n\"It did better than that.  It rained Esther.\"\n\n\"Aye?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.  \"What did Esther do?\"\n\n\"Why, cousin John,\" said Ada, clasping her hands upon his arm and \nshaking her head at me across him--for I wanted her to be quiet--\n\"Esther was their friend directly.  Esther nursed them, coaxed them \nto sleep, washed and dressed them, told them stories, kept them \nquiet, bought them keepsakes\"--My dear girl!  I had only gone out \nwith Peepy after he was found and given him a little, tiny horse!--\n\"and, cousin John, she softened poor Caroline, the eldest one, so \nmuch and was so thoughtful for me and so amiable!  No, no, I won\'t \nbe contradicted, Esther dear!  You know, you know, it\'s true!\"\n\nThe warm-hearted darling leaned across her cousin John and kissed \nme, and then looking up in his face, boldly said, \"At all events, \ncousin John, I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me.\"  \nI felt as if she challenged him to run away.  But he didn\'t.\n\n\"Where did you say the wind was, Rick?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"In the north as we came down, sir.\"\n\n\"You are right.  There\'s no east in it.  A mistake of mine.  Come, \ngirls, come and see your home!\"\n\nIt was one of those delightfully irregular houses where you go up \nand down steps out of one room into another, and where you come \nupon more rooms when you think you have seen all there are, and \nwhere there is a bountiful provision of little halls and passages, \nand where you find still older cottage-rooms in unexpected places \nwith lattice windows and green growth pressing through them.  Mine, \nwhich we entered first, was of this kind, with an up-and-down roof \nthat had more corners in it than I ever counted afterwards and a \nchimney (there was a wood fire on the hearth) paved all around with \npure white tiles, in every one of which a bright miniature of the \nfire was blazing.  Out of this room, you went down two steps into a \ncharming little sitting-room looking down upon a flower-garden, \nwhich room was henceforth to belong to Ada and me.  Out of this you \nwent up three steps into Ada\'s bedroom, which had a fine broad \nwindow commanding a beautiful view (we saw a great expanse of \ndarkness lying underneath the stars), to which there was a hollow \nwindow-seat, in which, with a spring-lock, three dear Adas might \nhave been lost at once.  Out of this room you passed into a little \ngallery, with which the other best rooms (only two) communicated, \nand so, by a little staircase of shallow steps with a number of \ncorner stairs in it, considering its length, down into the hall.  \nBut if instead of going out at Ada\'s door you came back into my \nroom, and went out at the door by which you had entered it, and \nturned up a few crooked steps that branched off in an unexpected \nmanner from the stairs, you lost yourself in passages, with mangles \nin them, and three-cornered tables, and a native Hindu chair, which \nwas also a sofa, a box, and a bedstead, and looked in every form \nsomething between a bamboo skeleton and a great bird-cage, and had \nbeen brought from India nobody knew by whom or when.  From these \nyou came on Richard\'s room, which was part library, part sitting-\nroom, part bedroom, and seemed indeed a comfortable compound of \nmany rooms.  Out of that you went straight, with a little interval \nof passage, to the plain room where Mr. Jarndyce slept, all the \nyear round, with his window open, his bedstead without any \nfurniture standing in the middle of the floor for more air, and his \ncold bath gaping for him in a smaller room adjoining.  Out of that \nyou came into another passage, where there were back-stairs and \nwhere you could hear the horses being rubbed down outside the \nstable and being told to \"Hold up\" and \"Get over,\" as they slipped \nabout very much on the uneven stones.  Or you might, if you came \nout at another door (every room had at least two doors), go \nstraight down to the hall again by half-a-dozen steps and a low \narchway, wondering how you got back there or had ever got out of \nit.\n\nThe furniture, old-fashioned rather than old, like the house, was \nas pleasantly irregular.  Ada\'s sleeping-room was all flowers--in \nchintz and paper, in velvet, in needlework, in the brocade of two \nstiff courtly chairs which stood, each attended by a little page of \na stool for greater state, on either side of the fire-place.  Our \nsitting-room was green and had framed and glazed upon the walls \nnumbers of surprising and surprised birds, staring out of pictures \nat a real trout in a case, as brown and shining as if it had been \nserved with gravy; at the death of Captain Cook; and at the whole \nprocess of preparing tea in China, as depicted by Chinese artists.  \nIn my room there were oval engravings of the months--ladies \nhaymaking in short waists and large hats tied under the chin, for \nJune; smooth-legged noblemen pointing with cocked-hats to village \nsteeples, for October.  Half-length portraits in crayons abounded \nall through the house, but were so dispersed that I found the \nbrother of a youthful officer of mine in the china-closet and the \ngrey old age of my pretty young bride, with a flower in her bodice, \nin the breakfast-room.  As substitutes, I had four angels, of Queen \nAnne\'s reign, taking a complacent gentleman to heaven, in festoons, \nwith some difficulty; and a composition in needlework representing \nfruit, a kettle, and an alphabet.  All the movables, from the \nwardrobes to the chairs and tables, hangings, glasses, even to the \npincushions and scent-bottles on the dressing-tables, displayed the \nsame quaint variety.  They agreed in nothing but their perfect \nneatness, their display of the whitest linen, and their storing-up, \nwheresoever the existence of a drawer, small or large, rendered it \npossible, of quantities of rose-leaves and sweet lavender.  Such, \nwith its illuminated windows, softened here and there by shadows of \ncurtains, shining out upon the starlight night; with its light, and \nwarmth, and comfort; with its hospitable jingle, at a distance, of \npreparations for dinner; with the face of its generous master \nbrightening everything we saw; and just wind enough without to \nsound a low accompaniment to everything we heard, were our first \nimpressions of Bleak House.\n\n\"I am glad you like it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce when he had brought us \nround again to Ada\'s sitting-room.  \"It makes no pretensions, but \nit is a comfortable little place, I hope, and will be more so with \nsuch bright young looks in it.  You have barely half an hour before \ndinner.  There\'s no one here but the finest creature upon earth--a \nchild.\"\n\n\"More children, Esther!\" said Ada.\n\n\"I don\'t mean literally a child,\" pursued Mr. Jarndyce; \"not a \nchild in years.  He is grown up--he is at least as old as I am--but \nin simplicity, and freshness, and enthusiasm, and a fine guileless \ninaptitude for all worldly affairs, he is a perfect child.\"\n\nWe felt that he must be very interesting.\n\n\"He knows Mrs. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.  \"He is a musical man, \nan amateur, but might have been a professional.  He is an artist \ntoo, an amateur, but might have been a professional.  He is a man \nof attainments and of captivating manners.  He has been unfortunate \nin his affairs, and unfortunate in his pursuits, and unfortunate in \nhis family; but he don\'t care--he\'s a child!\"\n\n\"Did you imply that he has children of his own, sir?\" inquired \nRichard.\n\n\"Yes, Rick!  Half-a-dozen.  More!  Nearer a dozen, I should think.  \nBut he has never looked after them.  How could he?  He wanted \nsomebody to look after HIM.  He is a child, you know!\" said Mr. \nJarndyce.\n\n\"And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?\" \ninquired Richard.\n\n\"Why, just as you may suppose,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, his countenance \nsuddenly falling.  \"It is said that the children of the very poor \nare not brought up, but dragged up.  Harold Skimpole\'s children \nhave tumbled up somehow or other.  The wind\'s getting round again, \nI am afraid.  I feel it rather!\"\n\nRichard observed that the situation was exposed on a sharp night.\n\n\"It IS exposed,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.  \"No doubt that\'s the cause.  \nBleak House has an exposed sound.  But you are coming my way.  Come \nalong!\"\n\nOur luggage having arrived and being all at hand, I was dressed in \na few minutes and engaged in putting my worldly goods away when a \nmaid (not the one in attendance upon Ada, but another, whom I had \nnot seen) brought a basket into my room with two bunches of keys in \nit, all labelled.\n\n\"For you, miss, if you please,\" said she.\n\n\"For me?\" said I.\n\n\"The housekeeping keys, miss.\"\n\nI showed my surprise, for she added with some little surprise on \nher own part, \"I was told to bring them as soon as you was alone, \nmiss.  Miss Summerson, if I don\'t deceive myself?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I.  \"That is my name.\"\n\n\"The large bunch is the housekeeping, and the little bunch is the \ncellars, miss.  Any time you was pleased to appoint tomorrow \nmorning, I was to show you the presses and things they belong to.\"\n\nI said I would be ready at half-past six, and after she was gone, \nstood looking at the basket, quite lost in the magnitude of my \ntrust.  Ada found me thus and had such a delightful confidence in \nme when I showed her the keys and told her about them that it would \nhave been insensibility and ingratitude not to feel encouraged.  I \nknew, to be sure, that it was the dear girl\'s kindness, but I liked \nto be so pleasantly cheated.\n\nWhen we went downstairs, we were presented to Mr. Skimpole, who was \nstanding before the fire telling Richard how fond he used to be, in \nhis school-time, of football.  He was a little bright creature with \na rather large head, but a delicate face and a sweet voice, and \nthere was a perfect charm in him.  All he said was so free from \neffort and spontaneous and was said with such a captivating gaiety \nthat it was fascinating to hear him talk.  Being of a more slender \nfigure than Mr. Jarndyce and having a richer complexion, with \nbrowner hair, he looked younger.  Indeed, he had more the \nappearance in all respects of a damaged young man than a well-\npreserved elderly one.  There was an easy negligence in his manner \nand even in his dress (his hair carelessly disposed, and his \nneckkerchief loose and flowing, as I have seen artists paint their \nown portraits) which I could not separate from the idea of a \nromantic youth who had undergone some unique process of \ndepreciation.  It struck me as being not at all like the manner or \nappearance of a man who had advanced in life by the usual road of \nyears, cares, and experiences.\n\nI gathered from the conversation that Mr. Skimpole had been \neducated for the medical profession and had once lived, in his \nprofessional capacity, in the household of a German prince.  He \ntold us, however, that as he had always been a mere child in point \nof weights and measures and had never known anything about them \n(except that they disgusted him), he had never been able to \nprescribe with the requisite accuracy of detail.  In fact, he said, \nhe had no head for detail.  And he told us, with great humour, that \nwhen he was wanted to bleed the prince or physic any of his people, \nhe was generally found lying on his back in bed, reading the \nnewspapers or making fancy-sketches in pencil, and couldn\'t come.  \nThe prince, at last, objecting to this, \"in which,\" said Mr. \nSkimpole, in the frankest manner, \"he was perfectly right,\" the \nengagement terminated, and Mr. Skimpole having (as he added with \ndelightful gaiety) \"nothing to live upon but love, fell in love, \nand married, and surrounded himself with rosy cheeks.\"  His good \nfriend Jarndyce and some other of his good friends then helped him, \nin quicker or slower succession, to several openings in life, but \nto no purpose, for he must confess to two of the oldest infirmities \nin the world: one was that he had no idea of time, the other that \nhe had no idea of money.  In consequence of which he never kept an \nappointment, never could transact any business, and never knew the \nvalue of anything!  Well!  So he had got on in life, and here he \nwas!  He was very fond of reading the papers, very fond of making \nfancy-sketches with a pencil, very fond of nature, very fond of \nart.  All he asked of society was to let him live.  THAT wasn\'t \nmuch.  His wants were few.  Give him the papers, conversation, \nmusic, mutton, coffee, landscape, fruit in the season, a few sheets \nof Bristol-board, and a little claret, and he asked no more.  He \nwas a mere child in the world, but he didn\'t cry for the moon.  He \nsaid to the world, \"Go your several ways in peace!  Wear red coats, \nblue coats, lawn sleeves; put pens behind your ears, wear aprons; \ngo after glory, holiness, commerce, trade, any object you prefer; \nonly--let Harold Skimpole live!\"\n\nAll this and a great deal more he told us, not only with the utmost \nbrilliancy and enjoyment, but with a certain vivacious candour--\nspeaking of himself as if he were not at all his own affair, as if \nSkimpole were a third person, as if he knew that Skimpole had his \nsingularities but still had his claims too, which were the general \nbusiness of the community and must not be slighted.  He was quite \nenchanting.  If I felt at all confused at that early time in \nendeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had \nthought about the duties and accountabilities of life (which I am \nfar from sure of), I was confused by not exactly understanding why \nhe was free of them.  That he WAS free of them, I scarcely doubted; \nhe was so very clear about it himself.\n\n\"I covet nothing,\" said Mr. Skimpole in the same light way.  \n\"Possession is nothing to me.  Here is my friend Jarndyce\'s \nexcellent house.  I feel obliged to him for possessing it.  I can \nsketch it and alter it.  I can set it to music.  When I am here, I \nhave sufficient possession of it and have neither trouble, cost, \nnor responsibility.  My steward\'s name, in short, is Jarndyce, and \nhe can\'t cheat me.  We have been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby.  There is \na bright-eyed woman, of a strong will and immense power of business \ndetail, who throws herself into objects with surprising ardour!  I \ndon\'t regret that I have not a strong will and an immense power of \nbusiness detail to throw myself into objects with surprising \nardour.  I can admire her without envy.  I can sympathize with the \nobjects.  I can dream of them.  I can lie down on the grass--in \nfine weather--and float along an African river, embracing all the \nnatives I meet, as sensible of the deep silence and sketching the \ndense overhanging tropical growth as accurately as if I were there.  \nI don\'t know that it\'s of any direct use my doing so, but it\'s all \nI can do, and I do it thoroughly.  Then, for heaven\'s sake, having \nHarold Skimpole, a confiding child, petitioning you, the world, an \nagglomeration of practical people of business habits, to let him \nlive and admire the human family, do it somehow or other, like good \nsouls, and suffer him to ride his rocking-horse!\"\n\nIt was plain enough that Mr. Jarndyce had not been neglectful of \nthe adjuration.  Mr. Skimpole\'s general position there would have \nrendered it so without the addition of what he presently said.\n\n\"It\'s only you, the generous creatures, whom I envy,\" said Mr. \nSkimpole, addressing us, his new friends, in an impersonal manner.  \n\"I envy you your power of doing what you do.  It is what I should \nrevel in myself.  I don\'t feel any vulgar gratitude to you.  I \nalmost feel as if YOU ought to be grateful to ME for giving you the \nopportunity of enjoying the luxury of generosity.  I know you like \nit.  For anything I can tell, I may have come into the world \nexpressly for the purpose of increasing your stock of happiness.  I \nmay have been born to be a benefactor to you by sometimes giving \nyou an opportunity of assisting me in my little perplexities.  Why \nshould I regret my incapacity for details and worldly affairs when \nit leads to such pleasant consequences?  I don\'t regret it \ntherefore.\"\n\nOf all his playful speeches (playful, yet always fully meaning what \nthey expressed) none seemed to be more to the taste of Mr. Jarndyce \nthan this.  I had often new temptations, afterwards, to wonder \nwhether it was really singular, or only singular to me, that he, \nwho was probably the most grateful of mankind upon the least \noccasion, should so desire to escape the gratitude of others.\n\nWe were all enchanted.  I felt it a merited tribute to the engaging \nqualities of Ada and Richard that Mr. Skimpole, seeing them for the \nfirst time, should he so unreserved and should lay himself out to \nbe so exquisitely agreeable.  They (and especially Richard) were \nnaturally pleased; for similar reasons, and considered it no common \nprivilege to be so freely confided in by such an attractive man.  \nThe more we listened, the more gaily Mr. Skimpole talked.  And what \nwith his fine hilarious manner and his engaging candour and his \ngenial way of lightly tossing his own weaknesses about, as if he \nhad said, \"I am a child, you know!  You are designing people \ncompared with me\" (he really made me consider myself in that light) \n\"but I am gay and innocent; forget your worldly arts and play with \nme!\" the effect was absolutely dazzling.\n\nHe was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for \nwhat was beautiful or tender that he could have won a heart by that \nalone.  In the evening, when I was preparing to make tea and Ada \nwas touching the piano in the adjoining room and softly humming a \ntune to her cousin Richard, which they had happened to mention, he \ncame and sat down on the sofa near me and so spoke of Ada that I \nalmost loved him.\n\n\"She is like the morning,\" he said.  \"With that golden hair, those \nblue eyes, and that fresh bloom on her cheek, she is like the \nsummer morning.  The birds here will mistake her for it.  We will \nnot call such a lovely young creature as that, who is a joy to all \nmankind, an orphan.  She is the child of the universe.\"\n\nMr. Jarndyce, I found, was standing near us with his hands behind \nhim and an attentive smile upon his face.\n\n\"The universe,\" he observed, \"makes rather an indifferent parent, I \nam afraid.\"\n\n\"Oh! I don\'t know!\" cried Mr. Skimpole buoyantly.\n\n\"I think I do know,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Skimpole.  \"You know the world (which in your \nsense is the universe), and I know nothing of it, so you shall have \nyour way.  But if I had mine,\" glancing at the cousins, \"there \nshould be no brambles of sordid realities in such a path as that.  \nIt should be strewn with roses; it should lie through bowers, where \nthere was no spring, autumn, nor winter, but perpetual summer.  Age \nor change should never wither it.  The base word money should never \nbe breathed near it!\"\n\nMr. Jarndyce patted him on the head with a smile, as if he had been \nreally a child, and passing a step or two on, and stopping a \nmoment, glanced at the young cousins.  His look was thoughtful, but \nhad a benignant expression in it which I often (how often!) saw \nagain, which has long been engraven on my heart.  The room in which \nthey were, communicating with that in which he stood, was only \nlighted by the fire.  Ada sat at the piano; Richard stood beside \nher, bending down.  Upon the wall, their shadows blended together, \nsurrounded by strange forms, not without a ghostly motion caught \nfrom the unsteady fire, though reflecting from motionless objects.  \nAda touched the notes so softly and sang so low that the wind, \nsighing away to the distant hills, was as audible as the music.  \nThe mystery of the future and the little clue afforded to it by the \nvoice of the present seemed expressed in the whole picture.\n\nBut it is not to recall this fancy, well as I remember it, that I \nrecall the scene.  First, I was not quite unconscious of the \ncontrast in respect of meaning and intention between the silent \nlook directed that way and the flow of words that had preceded it.  \nSecondly, though Mr. Jarndyce\'s glance as he withdrew it rested for \nbut a moment on me, I felt as if in that moment he confided to me--\nand knew that he confided to me and that I received the confidence\n--his hope that Ada and Richard might one day enter on a dearer \nrelationship.\n\nMr. Skimpole could play on the piano and the violoncello, and he \nwas a composer--had composed half an opera once, but got tired of \nit--and played what he composed with taste.  After tea we had quite \na little concert, in which Richard--who was enthralled by Ada\'s \nsinging and told me that she seemed to know all the songs that ever \nwere written--and Mr. Jarndyce, and I were the audience.  After a \nlittle while I missed first Mr. Skimpole and afterwards Richard, \nand while I was thinking how could Richard stay away so long and \nlose so much, the maid who had given me the keys looked in at the \ndoor, saying, \"If you please, miss, could you spare a minute?\"\n\nWhen I was shut out with her in the hall, she said, holding up her \nhands, \"Oh, if you please, miss, Mr. Carstone says would you come \nupstairs to Mr. Skimpole\'s room.  He has been took, miss!\"\n\n\"Took?\" said I. \n\n\"Took, miss.  Sudden,\" said the maid.\n\nI was apprehensive that his illness might be of a dangerous kind, \nbut of course I begged her to be quiet and not disturb any one and \ncollected myself, as I followed her quickly upstairs, sufficiently \nto consider what were the best remedies to be applied if it should \nprove to be a fit.  She threw open a door and I went into a \nchamber, where, to my unspeakable surprise, instead of finding Mr. \nSkimpole stretched upon the bed or prostrate on the floor, I found \nhim standing before the fire smiling at Richard, while Richard, \nwith a face of great embarrassment, looked at a person on the sofa, \nin a white great-coat, with smooth hair upon his head and not much \nof it, which he was wiping smoother and making less of with a \npocket-handkerchief.\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" said Richard hurriedly, \"I am glad you are come.  \nYou will be able to advise us.  Our friend Mr. Skimpole--don\'t be \nalarmed!--is arrested for debt.\"\n\n\"And really, my dear Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Skimpole with his \nagreeable candour, \"I never was in a situation in which that \nexcellent sense and quiet habit of method and usefulness, which \nanybody must observe in you who has the happiness of being a \nquarter of an hour in your society, was more needed.\"\n\nThe person on the sofa, who appeared to have a cold in his head, \ngave such a very loud snort that he startled me.\n\n\"Are you arrested for much, sir?\" I inquired of Mr. Skimpole.\n\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said he, shaking his head pleasantly, \"I \ndon\'t know.  Some pounds, odd shillings, and halfpence, I think, \nwere mentioned.\"\n\n\"It\'s twenty-four pound, sixteen, and sevenpence ha\'penny,\" \nobserved the stranger.  \"That\'s wot it is.\"\n\n\"And it sounds--somehow it sounds,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"like a \nsmall sum?\"\n\nThe strange man said nothing but made another snort.  It was such a \npowerful one that it seemed quite to lift him out of his seat.\n\n\"Mr. Skimpole,\" said Richard to me, \"has a delicacy in applying to \nmy cousin Jarndyce because he has lately--I think, sir, I \nunderstood you that you had lately--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" returned Mr. Skimpole, smiling.  \"Though I forgot how \nmuch it was and when it was.  Jarndyce would readily do it again, \nbut I have the epicure-like feeling that I would prefer a novelty \nin help, that I would rather,\" and he looked at Richard and me, \n\"develop generosity in a new soil and in a new form of flower.\"\n\n\"What do you think will be best, Miss Summerson?\" said Richard, \naside.\n\nI ventured to inquire, generally, before replying, what would \nhappen if the money were not produced.\n\n\"Jail,\" said the strange man, coolly putting his handkerchief into \nhis hat, which was on the floor at his feet.  \"Or Coavinses.\"\n\n\"May I ask, sir, what is--\"\n\n\"Coavinses?\" said the strange man.  \"A \'ouse.\"\n\nRichard and I looked at one another again.  It was a most singular \nthing that the arrest was our embarrassment and not Mr. Skimpole\'s.  \nHe observed us with a genial interest, but there seemed, if I may \nventure on such a contradiction, nothing selfish in it.  He had \nentirely washed his hands of the difficulty, and it had become \nours.\n\n\"I thought,\" he suggested, as if good-naturedly to help us out, \n\"that being parties in a Chancery suit concerning (as people say) a \nlarge amount of property, Mr. Richard or his beautiful cousin, or \nboth, could sign something, or make over something, or give some \nsort of undertaking, or pledge, or bond?  I don\'t know what the \nbusiness name of it may be, but I suppose there is some instrument \nwithin their power that would settle this?\"\n\n\"Not a bit on it,\" said the strange man.\n\n\"Really?\" returned Mr. Skimpole.  \"That seems odd, now, to one who \nis no judge of these things!\"\n\n\"Odd or even,\" said the stranger gruffly, \"I tell you, not a bit on \nit!\"\n\n\"Keep your temper, my good fellow, keep your temper!\" Mr. Skimpole \ngently reasoned with him as he made a little drawing of his head on \nthe fly-leaf of a book.  \"Don\'t be ruffled by your occupation.  We \ncan separate you from your office; we can separate the individual \nfrom the pursuit.  We are not so prejudiced as to suppose that in \nprivate life you are otherwise than a very estimable man, with a \ngreat deal of poetry in your nature, of which you may not be \nconscious.\n\nThe stranger only answered with another violent snort, whether in \nacceptance of the poetry-tribute or in disdainful rejection of it, \nhe did not express to me.\n\n\"Now, my dear Miss Summerson, and my dear Mr. Richard,\" said Mr. \nSkimpole gaily, innocently, and confidingly as he looked at his \ndrawing with his head on one side, \"here you see me utterly \nincapable of helping myself, and entirely in your hands!  I only \nask to be free.  The butterflies are free.  Mankind will surely not \ndeny to Harold Skimpole what it concedes to the butterflies!\"\n\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said Richard in a whisper, \"I have ten \npounds that I received from Mr. Kenge.  I must try what that will \ndo.\"\n\nI possessed fifteen pounds, odd shillings, which I had saved from \nmy quarterly allowance during several years.  I had always thought \nthat some accident might happen which would throw me suddenly, \nwithout any relation or any property, on the world and had always \ntried to keep some little money by me that I might not be quite \npenniless.  I told Richard of my having this little store and \nhaving no present need of it, and I asked him delicately to inform \nMr. Skimpole, while I should be gone to fetch it, that we would \nhave the pleasure of paying his debt.\n\nWhen I came back, Mr. Skimpole kissed my hand and seemed quite \ntouched.  Not on his own account (I was again aware of that \nperplexing and extraordinary contradiction), but on ours, as if \npersonal considerations were impossible with him and the \ncontemplation of our happiness alone affected him.  Richard, \nbegging me, for the greater grace of the transaction, as he said, \nto settle with Coavinses (as Mr. Skimpole now jocularly called \nhim), I counted out the money and received the necessary \nacknowledgment.  This, too, delighted Mr. Skimpole.\n\nHis compliments were so delicately administered that I blushed less \nthan I might have done and settled with the stranger in the white \ncoat without making any mistakes.  He put the money in his pocket \nand shortly said, \"Well, then, I\'ll wish you a good evening, miss.\n\n\"My friend,\" said Mr. Skimpole, standing with his back to the fire \nafter giving up the sketch when it was half finished, \"I should \nlike to ask you something, without offence.\"\n\nI think the reply was, \"Cut away, then!\"\n\n\"Did you know this morning, now, that you were coming out on this \nerrand?\" said Mr. Skimpole.\n\n\"Know\'d it yes\'day aft\'noon at tea-time,\" said Coavinses.\n\n\"It didn\'t affect your appetite?  Didn\'t make you at all uneasy?\"\n\n\"Not a hit,\" said Coavinses.  \"I know\'d if you wos missed to-day, \nyou wouldn\'t be missed to-morrow.  A day makes no such odds.\"\n\n\"But when you came down here,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"it was a \nfine day.  The sun was shining, the wind was blowing, the lights \nand shadows were passing across the fields, the birds were \nsinging.\"\n\n\"Nobody said they warn\'t, in MY hearing,\" returned Coavinses.\n\n\"No,\" observed Mr. Skimpole.  \"But what did you think upon the \nroad?\"\n\n\"Wot do you mean?\" growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong \nresentment.  \"Think!  I\'ve got enough to do, and little enough to \nget for it without thinking.  Thinking!\" (with profound contempt).\n\n\"Then you didn\'t think, at all events,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"to \nthis effect: \'Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine, loves to \nhear the wind blow, loves to watch the changing lights and shadows, \nloves to hear the birds, those choristers in Nature\'s great \ncathedral.  And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive \nHarold Skimpole of his share in such possessions, which are his \nonly birthright!\'  You thought nothing to that effect?\"\n\n\"I--certainly--did--NOT,\" said Coavinses, whose doggedness in \nutterly renouncing the idea was of that intense kind that he could \nonly give adequate expression to it by putting a long interval \nbetween each word, and accompanying the last with a jerk that might \nhave dislocated his neck.\n\n\"Very odd and very curious, the mental process is, in you men of \nbusiness!\" said Mr. Skimpole thoughtfully.  \"Thank you, my friend.  \nGood night.\"\n\nAs our absence had been long enough already to seem strange \ndownstairs, I returned at once and found Ada sitting at work by the \nfireside talking to her cousin John.  Mr. Skimpole presently \nappeared, and Richard shortly after him.  I was sufficiently \nengaged during the remainder of the evening in taking my first \nlesson in backgammon from Mr. Jarndyce, who was very fond of the \ngame and from whom I wished of course to learn it as quickly as I \ncould in order that I might be of the very small use of being able \nto play when he had no better adversary.  But I thought, \noccasionally, when Mr. Skimpole played some fragments of his own \ncompositions or when, both at the piano and the violoncello, and at \nour table, he preserved with an absence of all effort his \ndelightful spirits and his easy flow of conversation, that Richard \nand I seemed to retain the transferred impression of having been \narrested since dinner and that it was very curious altogether.\n\nIt was late before we separated, for when Ada was going at eleven \no\'clock, Mr. Skimpole went to the piano and rattled hilariously \nthat the best of all ways to lengthen our days was to steal a few \nhours from night, my dear!  It was past twelve before he took his \ncandle and his radiant face out of the room, and I think he might \nhave kept us there, if he had seen fit, until daybreak.  Ada and \nRichard were lingering for a few moments by the fire, wondering \nwhether Mrs. Jellyby had yet finished her dictation for the day, \nwhen Mr. Jarndyce, who had been out of the room, returned.\n\n\"Oh, dear me, what\'s this, what\'s this!\" he said, rubbing his head \nand walking about with his good-humoured vexation.  \"What\'s this \nthey tell me?  Rick, my boy, Esther, my dear, what have you been \ndoing?  Why did you do it?  How could you do it?  How much apiece \nwas it?  The wind\'s round again.  I feel it all over me!\"\n\nWe neither of us quite knew what to answer.\n\n\"Come, Rick, come!  I must settle this before I sleep.  How much \nare you out of pocket?  You two made the money up, you know!  Why \ndid you?  How could you?  Oh, Lord, yes, it\'s due east--must be!\"\n\n\"Really, sir,\" said Richard, \"I don\'t think it would be honourable \nin me to tell you.  Mr. Skimpole relied upon us--\"\n\n\"Lord bless you, my dear boy!  He relies upon everybody!\" said Mr. \nJarndyce, giving his head a great rub and stopping short.\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"Everybody!  And he\'ll be in the same scrape again next week!\" said \nMr. Jarndyce, walking again at a great pace, with a candle in his \nhand that had gone out.  \"He\'s always in the same scrape.  He was \nborn in the same scrape.  I verily believe that the announcement in \nthe newspapers when his mother was confined was \'On Tuesday last, \nat her residence in Botheration Buildings, Mrs. Skimpole of a son \nin difficulties.\'\"\n\nRichard laughed heartily but added, \"Still, sir, I don\'t want to \nshake his confidence or to break his confidence, and if I submit to \nyour better knowledge again, that I ought to keep his secret, I \nhope you will consider before you press me any more.  Of course, if \nyou do press me, sir, I shall know I am wrong and will tell you.\"\n\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce, stopping again, and making several \nabsent endeavours to put his candlestick in his pocket.  \"I--here!  \nTake it away, my dear.  I don\'t know what I am about with it; it\'s \nall the wind--invariably has that effect--I won\'t press you, Rick; \nyou may be right.  But really--to get hold of you and Esther--and \nto squeeze you like a couple of tender young Saint Michael\'s \noranges!  It\'ll blow a gale in the course of the night!\"\n\nHe was now alternately putting his hands into his pockets as if he \nwere going to keep them there a long time, and taking them out \nagain and vehemently rubbing them all over his head.\n\nI ventured to take this opportunity of hinting that Mr. Skimpole, \nbeing in all such matters quite a child--\n\n\"Eh, my dear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce, catching at the word.\n\nBeing quite a child, sir,\" said I, \"and so different from other \npeople--\"\n\n\"You are right!\" said Mr. Jarndyce, brightening.  \"Your woman\'s wit \nhits the mark.  He is a child--an absolute child.  I told you he \nwas a child, you know, when I first mentioned him.\"\n\nCertainly! Certainly! we said.\n\n\"And he IS a child.  Now, isn\'t he?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce, \nbrightening more and more.\n\nHe was indeed, we said.\n\n\"When you come to think of it, it\'s the height of childishness in \nyou--I mean me--\" said Mr. Jarodyce, \"to regard him for a moment as \na man.  You can\'t make HIM responsible.  The idea of Harold \nSkimpole with designs or plans, or knowledge of consequences!  Ha, \nha, ha!\"\n\nIt was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face \nclearing, and to see him so heartily pleased, and to know, as it \nwas impossible not to know, that the source of his pleasure was the \ngoodness which was tortured by condemning, or mistrusting, or \nsecretly accusing any one, that I saw the tears in Ada\'s eyes, \nwhile she echoed his laugh, and felt them in my own.\n\n\"Why, what a cod\'s head and shoulders I am,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to \nrequire reminding of it!  The whole business shows the child from \nbeginning to end.  Nobody but a child would have thought of \nsingling YOU two out for parties in the affair!  Nobody but a child \nwould have thought of YOUR having the money!  If it had been a \nthousand pounds, it would have been just the same!\" said Mr. \nJarndyce with his whole face in a glow.\n\nWe all confirmed it from our night\'s experience.\n\n\"To be sure, to be sure!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.  \"However, Rick, \nEsther, and you too, Ada, for I don\'t know that even your little \npurse is safe from his inexperience--I must have a promise all \nround that nothing of this sort shall ever be done any more.  No \nadvances!  Not even sixpences.\"\n\nWe all promised faithfully, Richard with a merry glance at me \ntouching his pocket as if to remind me that there was no danger of \nOUR transgressing.\n\n\"As to Skimpole,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"a habitable doll\'s house with \ngood board and a few tin people to get into debt with and borrow \nmoney of would set the boy up in life.  He is in a child\'s sleep by \nthis time, I suppose; it\'s time I should take my craftier head to \nmy more worldly pillow.  Good night, my dears.  God bless you!\"\n\nHe peeped in again, with a smiling face, before we had lighted our \ncandles, and said, \"Oh! I have been looking at the weather-cock.  I \nfind it was a false alarm about the wind.  It\'s in the south!\" And \nwent away singing to himself.\n\nAda and I agreed, as we talked together for a little while \nupstairs, that this caprice about the wind was a fiction and that \nhe used the pretence to account for any disappointment he could not \nconceal, rather than he would blame the real cause of it or \ndisparage or depreciate any one.  We thought this very \ncharacteristic of his eccentric gentleness and of the difference \nbetween him and those petulant people who make the weather and the \nwinds (particularly that unlucky wind which he had chosen for such \na different purpose) the stalking-horses of their splenetic and \ngloomy humours.\n\nIndeed, so much affection for him had been added in this one \nevening to my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand \nhim through that mingled feeling.  Any seeming inconsistencies in \nMr. Skimpole or in Mrs. Jellyby I could not expect to be able to \nreconcile, having so little experience or practical knowledge.  \nNeither did I try, for my thoughts were busy when I was alone, with \nAda and Richard and with the confidence I had seemed to receive \nconcerning them.  My fancy, made a little wild by the wind perhaps, \nwould not consent to be all unselfish, either, though I would have \npersuaded it to be so if I could.  It wandered back to my \ngodmother\'s house and came along the intervening track, raising up \nshadowy speculations which had sometimes trembled there in the dark \nas to what knowledge Mr. Jarndyce had of my earliest history--even \nas to the possibility of his being my father, though that idle \ndream was quite gone now.\n\nIt was all gone now, I remembered, getting up from the fire.  It was \nnot for me to muse over bygones, but to act with a cheerful spirit \nand a grateful heart.  So I said to myself, \"Esther, Esther, Esther!  \nDuty, my dear!\" and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such \na shake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to \nbed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe Ghost\'s Walk\n\n\nWhile Esther sleeps, and while Esther wakes, it is still wet weather \ndown at the place in Lincolnshire.  The rain is ever falling--drip, \ndrip, drip--by day and night upon the broad flagged terrace-\npavement, the Ghost\'s Walk.  The weather is so very bad down in \nLincolnshire that the liveliest imagination can scarcely apprehend \nits ever being fine again.  Not that there is any superabundant life \nof imagination on the spot, for Sir Leicester is not here (and, \ntruly, even if he were, would not do much for it in that \nparticular), but is in Paris with my Lady; and solitude, with dusky \nwings, sits brooding upon Chesney Wold.\n\nThere may be some motions of fancy among the lower animals at \nChesney Wold.  The horses in the stables--the long stables in a \nbarren, red-brick court-yard, where there is a great bell in a \nturret, and a clock with a large face, which the pigeons who live \nnear it and who love to perch upon its shoulders seem to be always \nconsulting--THEY may contemplate some mental pictures of fine \nweather on occasions, and may be better artists at them than the \ngrooms.  The old roan, so famous for cross-country work, turning his \nlarge eyeball to the grated window near his rack, may remember the \nfresh leaves that glisten there at other times and the scents that \nstream in, and may have a fine run with the hounds, while the human \nhelper, clearing out the next stall, never stirs beyond his \npitchfork and birch-broom.  The grey, whose place is opposite the \ndoor and who with an impatient rattle of his halter pricks his ears \nand turns his head so wistfully when it is opened, and to whom the \nopener says, \"\'Woa grey, then, steady!  Noabody wants you to-day!\" \nmay know it quite as well as the man.  The whole seemingly \nmonotonous and uncompanionable half-dozen, stabled together, may \npass the long wet hours when the door is shut in livelier \ncommunication than is held in the servants\' hall or at the Dedlock \nArms, or may even beguile the time by improving (perhaps corrupting) \nthe pony in the loose-box in the corner.\n\nSo the mastiff, dozing in his kennel in the court-yard with his \nlarge head on his paws, may think of the hot sunshine when the \nshadows of the stable-buildings tire his patience out by changing \nand leave him at one time of the day no broader refuge than the \nshadow of his own house, where he sits on end, panting and growling \nshort, and very much wanting something to worry besides himself and \nhis chain.  So now, half-waking and all-winking, he may recall the \nhouse full of company, the coach-houses full of vehicles, the \nstables fall of horses, and the out-buildings full of attendants \nupon horses, until he is undecided about the present and comes forth \nto see how it is.  Then, with that impatient shake of himself, he \nmay growl in the spirit, \"Rain, rain, rain!  Nothing but rain--and \nno family here!\" as he goes in again and lies down with a gloomy \nyawn.\n\nSo with the dogs in the kennel-buildings across the park, who have \ntheir resfless fits and whose doleful voices when the wind has been \nvery obstinate have even made it known in the house itself--\nupstairs, downstairs, and in my Lady\'s chamber.  They may hunt the \nwhole country-side, while the raindrops are pattering round their \ninactivity.  So the rabbits with their self-betraying tails, \nfrisking in and out of holes at roots of trees, may be lively with \nideas of the breezy days when their ears are blown about or of those \nseasons of interest when there are sweet young plants to gnaw.  The \nturkey in the poultry-yard, always troubled with a class-grievance \n(probably Christmas), may be reminiscent of that summer morning \nwrongfully taken from him when he got into the lane among the felled \ntrees, where there was a barn and barley.  The discontented goose, \nwho stoops to pass under the old gateway, twenty feet high, may \ngabble out, if we only knew it, a waddling preference for weather \nwhen the gateway casts its shadow on the ground.\n\nBe this as it may, there is not much fancy otherwise stirring at \nChesney Wold.  If there be a little at any odd moment, it goes, \nlike a little noise in that old echoing place, a long way and \nusually leads off to ghosts and mystery.\n\nIt has rained so hard and rained so long down in Lincolnshire that \nMrs. Rouncewell, the old housekeeper at Chesney Wold, has several \ntimes taken off her spectacles and cleaned them to make certain \nthat the drops were not upon the glasses.  Mrs. Rouncewell might \nhave been sufficiently assured by hearing the rain, but that she is \nrather deaf, which nothing will induce her to believe.  She is a \nfine old lady, handsome, stately, wonderfully neat, and has such a \nback and such a stomacher that if her stays should turn out when \nshe dies to have been a broad old-fashioned family fire-grate, \nnobody who knows her would have cause to be surprised.  Weather \naffects Mrs. Rouncewell little.  The house is there in all \nweathers, and the house, as she expresses it, \"is what she looks \nat.\"  She sits in her room (in a side passage on the ground floor, \nwith an arched window commanding a smooth quadrangle, adorned at \nregular intervals with smooth round trees and smooth round blocks \nof stone, as if the trees were going to play at bowls with the \nstones), and the whole house reposes on her mind.  She can open it \non occasion and be busy and fluttered, but it is shut up now and \nlies on the breadth of Mrs. Rouncewell\'s iron-bound bosom in a \nmajestic sleep.\n\nIt is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine \nChesney Wold without Mrs. Rouncewell, but she has only been here \nfifty years.  Ask her how long, this rainy day, and she shall \nanswer \"fifty year, three months, and a fortnight, by the blessing \nof heaven, if I live till Tuesday.\"  Mr. Rouncewell died some time \nbefore the decease of the pretty fashion of pig-tails, and modestly \nhid his own (if he took it with him) in a corner of the churchyard \nin the park near the mouldy porch.  He was born in the market-town, \nand so was his young widow.  Her progress in the family began in \nthe time of the last Sir Leicester and originated in the still-room.\n\nThe present representative of the Dedlocks is an excellent master.  \nHe supposes all his dependents to be utterly bereft of individual \ncharacters, intentions, or opinions, and is persuaded that he was \nborn to supersede the necessity of their having any.  If he were to \nmake a discovery to the contrary, he would be simply stunned--would \nnever recover himself, most likely, except to gasp and die.  But he \nis an excellent master still, holding it a part of his state to be \nso.  He has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell; he says she is a \nmost respectable, creditable woman.  He always shakes hands with \nher when he comes down to Chesney Wold and when he goes away; and \nif he were very ill, or if he were knocked down by accident, or run \nover, or placed in any situation expressive of a Dedlock at a \ndisadvantage, he would say if he could speak, \"Leave me, and send \nMrs. Rouncewell here!\" feeling his dignity, at such a pass, safer \nwith her than with anybody else.\n\nMrs. Rouncewell has known trouble.  She has had two sons, of whom \nthe younger ran wild, and went for a soldier, and never came back.  \nEven to this hour, Mrs. Rouncewell\'s calm hands lose their \ncomposure when she speaks of him, and unfolding themselves from her \nstomacher, hover about her in an agitated manner as she says what a \nlikely lad, what a fine lad, what a gay, good-humoured, clever lad \nhe was!  Her second son would have been provided for at Chesney \nWold and would have been made steward in due season, but he took, \nwhen he was a schoolboy, to constructing steam-engines out of \nsaucepans and setting birds to draw their own water with the least \npossible amount of labour, so assisting them with artful \ncontrivance of hydraulic pressure that a thirsty canary had only, \nin a literal sense, to put his shoulder to the wheel and the job \nwas done.  This propensity gave Mrs. Rouncewell great uneasiness.  \nShe felt it with a mother\'s anguish to be a move in the Wat Tyler \ndirection, well knowing that Sir Leicester had that general \nimpression of an aptitude for any art to which smoke and a tall \nchimney might be considered essential.  But the doomed young rebel \n(otherwise a mild youth, and very persevering), showing no sign of \ngrace as he got older but, on the contrary, constructing a model of \na power-loom, she was fain, with many tears, to mention his \nbackslidings to the baronet.  \"Mrs. Rouncewell,\" said Sir \nLeicester, \"I can never consent to argue, as you know, with any one \non any subject.  You had better get rid of your boy; you had better \nget him into some Works.  The iron country farther north is, I \nsuppose, the congenial direction for a boy with these tendencies.\"  \nFarther north he went, and farther north he grew up; and if Sir \nLeicester Dedlock ever saw him when he came to Chesney Wold to \nvisit his mother, or ever thought of him afterwards, it is certain \nthat he only regarded him as one of a body of some odd thousand \nconspirators, swarthy and grim, who were in the habit of turning \nout by torchlight two or three nights in the week for unlawful \npurposes.\n\nNevertheless, Mrs. Rouncewell\'s son has, in the course of nature \nand art, grown up, and established himself, and married, and called \nunto him Mrs. Rouncewell\'s grandson, who, being out of his \napprenticeship, and home from a journey in far countries, whither \nhe was sent to enlarge his knowledge and complete his preparations \nfor the venture of this life, stands leaning against the chimney-\npiece this very day in Mrs. Rouncewell\'s room at Chesney Wold.\n\n\"And, again and again, I am glad to see you, Watt!  And, once \nagain, I am glad to see you, Watt!\" says Mrs. Rouncewell.  \"You are \na fine young fellow.  You are like your poor uncle George.  Ah!\"  \nMrs. Rouncewell\'s hands unquiet, as usual, on this reference.\n\n\"They say I am like my father, grandmother.\"\n\n\"Like him, also, my dear--but most like your poor uncle George!  \nAnd your dear father.\"  Mrs. Rouncewell folds her hands again.  \"He \nis well?\"\n\n\"Thriving, grandmother, in every way.\"\n\n\"I am thankful!\"  Mrs. Rouncewell is fond of her son but has a \nplaintive feeling towards him, much as if he were a very honourable \nsoldier who had gone over to the enemy.\n\n\"He is quite happy?\" says she.\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"I am thankful!  So he has brought you up to follow in his ways and \nhas sent you into foreign countries and the like?  Well, he knows \nbest.  There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I don\'t \nunderstand.  Though I am not young, either.  And I have seen a \nquantity of good company too!\"\n\n\"Grandmother,\" says the young man, changing the subject, \"what a \nvery pretty girl that was I found with you just now.  You called \nher Rosa?\"\n\n\"Yes, child.  She is daughter of a widow in the village.  Maids are \nso hard to teach, now-a-days, that I have put her about me young.  \nShe\'s an apt scholar and will do well.  She shows the house \nalready, very pretty.  She lives with me at my table here.\"\n\n\"I hope I have not driven her away?\"\n\n\"She supposes we have family affairs to speak about, I dare say.  \nShe is very modest.  It is a fine quality in a young woman.  And \nscarcer,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell, expanding her stomacher to its \nutmost limits, \"than it formerly was!\"\n\nThe young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts \nof experience.  Mrs. Rouncewell listens.\n\n\"Wheels!\" says she.  They have long been audible to the younger \nears of her companion.  \"What wheels on such a day as this, for \ngracious sake?\"\n\nAfter a short interval, a tap at the door.  \"Come in!\"  A dark-\neyed, dark-haired, shy, village beauty comes in--so fresh in her \nrosy and yet delicate bloom that the drops of rain which have \nbeaten on her hair look like the dew upon a flower fresh gathered.\n\n\"What company is this, Rosa?\" says Mrs. Rouncewell.\n\n\"It\'s two young men in a gig, ma\'am, who want to see the house--\nyes, and if you please, I told them so!\" in quick reply to a \ngesture of dissent from the housekeeper.  \"I went to the hall-door \nand told them it was the wrong day and the wrong hour, but the \nyoung man who was driving took off his hat in the wet and begged me \nto bring this card to you.\"\n\n\"Read it, my dear Watt,\" says the housekeeper.\n\nRosa is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between \nthem and almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up.  \nRosa is shyer than before.\n\n\"Mr. Guppy\" is all the information the card yields.\n\n\"Guppy!\" repeats Mrs. Rouncewell, \"MR. Guppy!  Nonsense, I never \nheard of him!\"\n\n\"If you please, he told ME that!\" says Rosa.  \"But he said that he \nand the other young gentleman came from London only last night by \nthe mail, on business at the magistrates\' meeting, ten miles off, \nthis morning, and that as their business was soon over, and they \nhad heard a great deal said of Chesney Wold, and really didn\'t know \nwhat to do with themselves, they had come through the wet to see \nit.  They are lawyers.  He says he is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn\'s \noffice, but he is sure he may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn\'s name if \nnecessary.\"  Finding, now she leaves off, that she has been making \nquite a long speech, Rosa is shyer than ever.\n\nNow, Mr. Tulkinghorn is, in a manner, part and parcel of the place, \nand besides, is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell\'s will.  The \nold lady relaxes, consents to the admission of the visitors as a \nfavour, and dismisses Rosa.  The grandson, however, being smitten \nby a sudden wish to see the house himself, proposes to join the \nparty.  The grandmother, who is pleased that he should have that \ninterest, accompanies him--though to do him justice, he is \nexceedingly unwilling to trouble her.\n\n\"Much obliged to you, ma\'am!\" says Mr. Guppy, divesting himself of \nhis wet dreadnought in the hall.  \"Us London lawyers don\'t often \nget an out, and when we do, we like to make the most of it, you \nknow.\"\n\nThe old housekeeper, with a gracious severity of deportment, waves \nher hand towards the great staircase.  Mr. Guppy and his friend \nfollow Rosa; Mrs. Rouncewell and her grandson follow them; a young \ngardener goes before to open the shutters.\n\nAs is usually the case with people who go over houses, Mr. Guppy \nand his friend are dead beat before they have well begun.  They \nstraggle about in wrong places, look at wrong things, don\'t care \nfor the right things, gape when more rooms are opened, exhibit \nprofound depression of spirits, and are clearly knocked up.  In \neach successive chamber that they enter, Mrs. Rouncewell, who is as \nupright as the house itself, rests apart in a window-seat or other \nsuch nook and listens with stately approval to Rosa\'s exposition.  \nHer grandson is so attentive to it that Rosa is shyer than ever--\nand prettier.  Thus they pass on from room to room, raising the \npictured Dedlocks for a few brief minutes as the young gardener \nadmits the light, and reconsigning them to their graves as he shuts \nit out again.  It appears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his \ninconsolable friend that there is no end to the Dedlocks, whose \nfamily greatness seems to consist in their never having done \nanything to distinguish themselves for seven hundred years.\n\nEven the long drawing-room of Chesney Wold cannot revive Mr. \nGuppy\'s spirits.  He is so low that he droops on the threshold and \nhas hardly strength of mind to enter.  But a portrait over the \nchimney-piece, painted by the fashionable artist of the day, acts \nupon him like a charm.  He recovers in a moment.  He stares at it \nwith uncommon interest; he seems to be fixed and fascinated by it.\n\n\"Dear me!\" says Mr. Guppy.  \"Who\'s that?\"\n\n\"The picture over the fire-place,\" says Rosa, \"is the portrait of \nthe present Lady Dedlock.  It is considered a perfect likeness, and \nthe best work of the master.\"\n\n\"\'Blest,\" says Mr. Guppy, staring in a kind of dismay at his \nfriend, \"if I can ever have seen her.  Yet I know her!  Has the \npicture been engraved, miss?\"\n\n\"The picture has never been engraved.  Sir Leicester has always \nrefused permission.\"\n\n\"Well!\" says Mr. Guppy in a low voice.  \"I\'ll be shot if it ain\'t \nvery curious how well I know that picture!  So that\'s Lady Dedlock, \nis it!\"\n\n\"The picture on the right is the present Sir Leicester Dedlock.  \nThe picture on the left is his father, the late Sir Leicester.\"\n\nMr. Guppy has no eyes for either of these magnates.  \"It\'s \nunaccountable to me,\" he says, still staring at the portrait, \"how \nwell I know that picture!  I\'m dashed,\" adds Mr. Guppy, looking \nround, \"if I don\'t think I must have had a dream of that picture, \nyou know!\"\n\nAs no one present takes any especial interest in Mr. Guppy\'s \ndreams, the probability is not pursued.  But he still remains so \nabsorbed by the portrait that he stands immovable before it until \nthe young gardener has closed the shutters, when he comes out of \nthe room in a dazed state that is an odd though a sufficient \nsubstitute for interest and follows into the succeeding rooms with \na confused stare, as if he were looking everywhere for Lady Dedlock \nagain.\n\nHe sees no more of her.  He sees her rooms, which are the last \nshown, as being very elegant, and he looks out of the windows from \nwhich she looked out, not long ago, upon the weather that bored her \nto death.  All things have an end, even houses that people take \ninfinite pains to see and are tired of before they begin to see \nthem.  He has come to the end of the sight, and the fresh village \nbeauty to the end of her description; which is always this: \"The \nterrace below is much admired.  It is called, from an old story in \nthe family, the Ghost\'s Walk.\"\n\n\"No?\" says Mr. Guppy, greedily curious.  \"What\'s the story, miss?  \nIs it anything about a picture?\"\n\n\"Pray tell us the story,\" says Watt in a half whisper.\n\n\"I don\'t know it, sir.\"  Rosa is shyer than ever.\n\n\"It is not related to visitors; it is almost forgotten,\" says the \nhousekeeper, advancing.  \"It has never been more than a family \nanecdote.\"\n\n\"You\'ll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a \npicture, ma\'am,\" observes Mr. Guppy, \"because I do assure you that \nthe more I think of that picture the better I know it, without \nknowing how I know it!\"\n\nThe story has nothing to do with a picture; the housekeeper can \nguarantee that.  Mr. Guppy is obliged to her for the information \nand is, moreover, generally obliged.  He retires with his friend, \nguided down another staircase by the young gardener, and presently \nis heard to drive away.  It is now dusk.  Mrs. Rouncewell can trust \nto the discretion of her two young hearers and may tell THEM how \nthe terrace came to have that ghostly name.\n\nShe seats herself in a large chair by the fast-darkening window and \ntells them: \"In the wicked days, my dears, of King Charles the \nFirst--I mean, of course, in the wicked days of the rebels who \nleagued themselves against that excellent king--Sir Morbury Dedlock \nwas the owner of Chesney Wold.  Whether there was any account of a \nghost in the family before those days, I can\'t say.  I should think \nit very likely indeed.\"\n\nMrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion because she considers that a \nfamily of such antiquity and importance has a right to a ghost.  \nShe regards a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper classes, \na genteel distinction to which the common people have no claim.\n\n\"Sir Morbury Dedlock,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell, \"was, I have no \noccasion to say, on the side of the blessed martyr.  But it IS \nsupposed that his Lady, who had none of the family blood in her \nveins, favoured the bad cause.  It is said that she had relations \namong King Charles\'s enemies, that she was in correspondence with \nthem, and that she gave them information.  When any of the country \ngentlemen who followed his Majesty\'s cause met here, it is said \nthat my Lady was always nearer to the door of their council-room \nthan they supposed.  Do you hear a sound like a footstep passing \nalong the terrace, Watt?\"\n\nRosa draws nearer to the housekeeper.\n\n\"I hear the rain-drip on the stones,\" replies the young man, \"and I \nhear a curious echo--I suppose an echo--which is very like a \nhalting step.\"\n\nThe housekeeper gravely nods and continues: \"Partly on account of \nthis division between them, and partly on other accounts, Sir \nMorbury and his Lady led a troubled life.  She was a lady of a \nhaughty temper.  They were not well suited to each other in age or \ncharacter, and they had no children to moderate between them.  \nAfter her favourite brother, a young gentleman, was killed in the \ncivil wars (by Sir Morbury\'s near kinsman), her feeling was so \nviolent that she hated the race into which she had married.  When \nthe Dedlocks were about to ride out from Chesney Wold in the king\'s \ncause, she is supposed to have more than once stolen down into the \nstables in the dead of night and lamed their horses; and the story \nis that once at such an hour, her husband saw her gliding down the \nstairs and followed her into the stall where his own favourite \nhorse stood.  There he seized her by the wrist, and in a struggle \nor in a fall or through the horse being frightened and lashing out, \nshe was lamed in the hip and from that hour began to pine away.\"\n\nThe housekeeper has dropped her voice to a little more than a \nwhisper.\n\n\"She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage.  \nShe never complained of the change; she never spoke to any one of \nbeing crippled or of being in pain, but day by day she tried to \nwalk upon the terrace, and with the help of the stone balustrade, \nwent up and down, up and down, up and down, in sun and shadow, with \ngreater difficulty every day.  At last, one afternoon her husband \n(to whom she had never, on any persuasion, opened her lips since \nthat night), standing at the great south window, saw her drop upon \nthe pavement.  He hastened down to raise her, but she repulsed him \nas he bent over her, and looking at him fixedly and coldly, said, \n\'I will die here where I have walked.  And I will walk here, though \nI am in my grave.  I will walk here until the pride of this house \nis humbled.  And when calamity or when disgrace is coming to it, \nlet the Dedlocks listen for my step!\'\n\nWatt looks at Rosa.  Rosa in the deepening gloom looks down upon \nthe ground, half frightened and half shy.\n\n\"There and then she died.  And from those days,\" says Mrs. \nRouncewell, \"the name has come down--the Ghost\'s Walk.  If the \ntread is an echo, it is an echo that is only heard after dark, and \nis often unheard for a long while together.  But it comes back from \ntime to time; and so sure as there is sickness or death in the \nfamily, it will be heard then.\"\n\n\"And disgrace, grandmother--\" says Watt.\n\n\"Disgrace never comes to Chesney Wold,\" returns the housekeeper.\n\nHer grandson apologizes with \"True.  True.\"\n\n\"That is the story.  Whatever the sound is, it is a worrying \nsound,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell, getting up from her chair; \"and what \nis to be noticed in it is that it MUST BE HEARD.  My Lady, who is \nafraid of nothing, admits that when it is there, it must be heard.  \nYou cannot shut it out.  Watt, there is a tall French clock behind \nyou (placed there, \'a purpose) that has a loud beat when it is in \nmotion and can play music.  You understand how those things are \nmanaged?\"\n\n\"Pretty well, grandmother, I think.\"\n\n\"Set it a-going.\"\n\nWatt sets it a-going--music and all.\n\n\"Now, come hither,\" says the housekeeper.  \"Hither, child, towards \nmy Lady\'s pillow.  I am not sure that it is dark enough yet, but \nlisten!  Can you hear the sound upon the terrace, through the \nmusic, and the beat, and everything?\"\n\n\"I certainly can!\"\n\n\"So my Lady says.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nCovering a Multitude of Sins\n\n\nIt was interesting when I dressed before daylight to peep out of \nwindow, where my candles were reflected in the black panes like two \nbeacons, and finding all beyond still enshrouded in the \nindistinctness of last night, to watch how it turned out when the \nday came on.  As the prospect gradually revealed itself and \ndisclosed the scene over which the wind had wandered in the dark, \nlike my memory over my life, I had a pleasure in discovering the \nunknown objects that had been around me in my sleep.  At first they \nwere faintly discernible in the mist, and above them the later \nstars still glimmered.  That pale interval over, the picture began \nto enlarge and fill up so fast that at every new peep I could have \nfound enough to look at for an hour.  Imperceptibly my candles \nbecame the only incongruous part of the morning, the dark places in \nmy room all melted away, and the day shone bright upon a cheerful \nlandscape, prominent in which the old Abbey Church, with its \nmassive tower, threw a softer train of shadow on the view than \nseemed compatible with its rugged character.  But so from rough \noutsides (I hope I have learnt), serene and gentle influences often \nproceed.\n\nEvery part of the house was in such order, and every one was so \nattentive to me, that I had no trouble with my two bunches of keys, \nthough what with trying to remember the contents of each little \nstore-room drawer and cupboard; and what with making notes on a \nslate about jams, and pickles, and preserves, and bottles, and \nglass, and china, and a great many other things; and what with \nbeing generally a methodical, old-maidish sort of foolish little \nperson, I was so busy that I could not believe it was breakfast-\ntime when I heard the bell ring.  Away I ran, however, and made \ntea, as I had already been installed into the responsibility of the \ntea-pot; and then, as they were all rather late and nobody was down \nyet, I thought I would take a peep at the garden and get some \nknowledge of that too.  I found it quite a delightful place--in \nfront, the pretty avenue and drive by which we had approached (and \nwhere, by the by, we had cut up the gravel so terribly with our \nwheels that I asked the gardener to roll it); at the back, the \nflower-garden, with my darling at her window up there, throwing it \nopen to smile out at me, as if she would have kissed me from that \ndistance.  Beyond the flower-garden was a kitchen-garden, and then \na paddock, and then a snug little rick-yard, and then a dear little \nfarm-yard.  As to the house itself, with its three peaks in the \nroof; its various-shaped windows, some so large, some so small, and \nall so pretty; its trellis-work, against the southfront for roses \nand honey-suckle, and its homely, comfortable, welcoming look--it \nwas, as Ada said when she came out to meet me with her arm through \nthat of its master, worthy of her cousin John, a bold thing to say, \nthough he only pinched her dear cheek for it.\n\nMr. Skimpole was as agreeable at breakfast as he had been \novernight.  There was honey on the table, and it led him into a \ndiscourse about bees.  He had no objection to honey, he said (and I \nshould think he had not, for he seemed to like it), but he \nprotested against the overweening assumptions of bees.  He didn\'t \nat all see why the busy bee should be proposed as a model to him; \nhe supposed the bee liked to make honey, or he wouldn\'t do it--\nnobody asked him.  It was not necessary for the bee to make such a \nmerit of his tastes.  If every confectioner went buzzing about the \nworld banging against everything that came in his way and \negotistically calling upon everybody to take notice that he was \ngoing to his work and must not be interrupted, the world would be \nquite an unsupportable place.  Then, after all, it was a ridiculous \nposition to be smoked out of your fortune with brimstone as soon as \nyou had made it.  You would have a very mean opinion of a \nManchester man if he spun cotton for no other purpose.  He must say \nhe thought a drone the embodiment of a pleasanter and wiser idea.  \nThe drone said unaffectedly, \"You will excuse me; I really cannot \nattend to the shop!  I find myself in a world in which there is so \nmuch to see and so short a time to see it in that I must take the \nliberty of looking about me and begging to be provided for by \nsomebody who doesn\'t want to look about him.\"  This appeared to Mr. \nSkimpole to be the drone philosophy, and he thought it a very good \nphilosophy, always supposing the drone to be willing to be on good \nterms with the bee, which, so far as he knew, the easy fellow \nalways was, if the consequential creature would only let him, and \nnot be so conceited about his honey!\n\nHe pursued this fancy with the lightest foot over a variety of \nground and made us all merry, though again he seemed to have as \nserious a meaning in what he said as he was capable of having.  I \nleft them still listening to him when I withdrew to attend to my \nnew duties.  They had occupied me for some time, and I was passing \nthrough the passages on my return with my basket of keys on my arm \nwhen Mr. Jarndyce called me into a small room next his bed-chamber, \nwhich I found to be in part a little library of books and papers \nand in part quite a little museum of his boots and shoes and hat-\nboxes.\n\n\"Sit down, my dear,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.  \"This, you must know, is \nthe growlery.  When I am out of humour, I come and growl here.\"\n\n\"You must be here very seldom, sir,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, you don\'t know me!\" he returned.  \"When I am deceived or \ndisappointed in--the wind, and it\'s easterly, I take refuge here.  \nThe growlery is the best-used room in the house.  You are not aware \nof half my humours yet.  My dear, how you are trembling!\"\n\nI could not help it; I tried very hard, but being alone with that \nbenevolent presence, and meeting his kind eyes, and feeling so \nhappy and so honoured there, and my heart so full--\n\nI kissed his hand.  I don\'t know what I said, or even that I spoke.  \nHe was disconcerted and walked to the window; I almost believed \nwith an intention of jumping out, until he turned and I was \nreassured by seeing in his eyes what he had gone there to hide.  He \ngently patted me on the head, and I sat down.\n\n\"There!  There!\" he said.  \"That\'s over.  Pooh!  Don\'t be foolish.\"\n\n\"It shall not happen again, sir,\" I returned, \"but at first it is \ndifficult--\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" he said.  \"It\'s easy, easy.  Why not?  I hear of a good \nlittle orphan girl without a protector, and I take it into my head \nto be that protector.  She grows up, and more than justifies my \ngood opinion, and I remain her guardian and her friend.  What is \nthere in all this?  So, so!  Now, we have cleared off old scores, \nand I have before me thy pleasant, trusting, trusty face again.\"\n\nI said to myself, \"Esther, my dear, you surprise me!  This really \nis not what I expected of you!\"  And it had such a good effect that \nI folded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered myself.  Mr. \nJarndyce, expressing his approval in his face, began to talk to me \nas confidentially as if I had been in the habit of conversing with \nhim every morning for I don\'t know how long.  I almost felt as if I \nhad.\n\n\"Of course, Esther,\" he said, \"you don\'t understand this Chancery \nbusiness?\"\n\nAnd of course I shook my head.\n\n\"I don\'t know who does,\" he returned.  \"The lawyers have twisted it \ninto such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the \ncase have long disappeared from the face of the earth.  It\'s about \na will and the trusts under a will--or it was once.  It\'s about \nnothing but costs now.  We are always appearing, and disappearing, \nand swearing, and interrogating, and filing, and cross-filing, and \narguing, and sealing, and motioning, and referring, and reporting, \nand revolving about the Lord Chancellor and all his satellites, and \nequitably waltzing ourselves off to dusty death, about costs.  \nThat\'s the great question.  All the rest, by some extraordinary \nmeans, has melted away.\"\n\n\"But it was, sir,\" said I, to bring him back, for he began to rub \nhis head, \"about a will?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, it was about a will when it was about anything,\" he \nreturned.   \"A certain Jarndyce, in an evil hour, made a great \nfortune, and made a great will.  In the question how the trusts \nunder that will are to be administered, the fortune left by the \nwill is squandered away; the legatees under the will are reduced to \nsuch a miserable condition that they would be sufficiently punished \nif they had committed an enormous crime in having money left them, \nand the will itself is made a dead letter.  All through the \ndeplorable cause, everything that everybody in it, except one man, \nknows already is referred to that only one man who don\'t know it to \nfind out--all through the deplorable cause, everybody must have \ncopies, over and over again, of everything that has accumulated \nabout it in the way of cartloads of papers (or must pay for them \nwithout having them, which is the usual course, for nobody wants \nthem) and must go down the middle and up again through such an \ninfernal country-dance of costs and fees and nonsense and \ncorruption as was never dreamed of in the wildest visions of a \nwitch\'s Sabbath.  Equity sends questions to law, law sends \nquestions back to equity; law finds it can\'t do this, equity finds \nit can\'t do that; neither can so much as say it can\'t do anything, \nwithout this solicitor instructing and this counsel appearing for \nA, and that solicitor instructing and that counsel appearing for B; \nand so on through the whole alphabet, like the history of the apple \npie.  And thus, through years and years, and lives and lives, \neverything goes on, constantly beginning over and over again, and \nnothing ever ends.  And we can\'t get out of the suit on any terms, \nfor we are made parties to it, and MUST BE parties to it, whether \nwe like it or not.  But it won\'t do to think of it!  When my great \nuncle, poor Tom Jarndyce, began to think of it, it was the \nbeginning of the end!\"\n\n\"The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard?\"\n\nHe nodded gravely.  \"I was his heir, and this was his house, \nEsther.  When I came here, it was bleak indeed.  He had left the \nsigns of his misery upon it.\"\n\n\"How changed it must be now!\" I said.\n\n\"It had been called, before his time, the Peaks.  He gave it its \npresent name and lived here shut up, day and night poring over the \nwicked heaps of papers in the suit and hoping against hope to \ndisentangle it from its mystification and bring it to a close.  In \nthe meantime, the place became dilapidated, the wind whistled \nthrough the cracked walls, the rain fell through the broken roof, \nthe weeds choked the passage to the rotting door.  When I brought \nwhat remained of him home here, the brains seemed to me to have \nbeen blown out of the house too, it was so shattered and ruined.\"\n\nHe walked a little to and fro after saying this to himself with a \nshudder, and then looked at me, and brightened, and came and sat \ndown again with his hands in his pockets.\n\n\"I told you this was the growlery, my dear.  Where was I?\"\n\nI reminded him, at the hopeful change he had made in Bleak House.\n\n\"Bleak House; true.  There is, in that city of London there, some \nproperty of ours which is much at this day what Bleak House was \nthen; I say property of ours, meaning of the suit\'s, but I ought to \ncall it the property of costs, for costs is the only power on earth \nthat will ever get anything out of it now or will ever know it for \nanything but an eyesore and a heartsore.  It is a street of \nperishing blind houses, with their eyes stoned out, without a pane \nof glass, without so much as a window-frame, with the bare blank \nshutters tumbling from their hinges and falling asunder, the iron \nrails peeling away in flakes of rust, the chimneys sinking in, the \nstone steps to every door (and every door might be death\'s door) \nturning stagnant green, the very crutches on which the ruins are \npropped decaying.  Although Bleak House was not in Chancery, its \nmaster was, and it was stamped with the same seal.  These are the \nGreat Seal\'s impressions, my dear, all over England--the children \nknow them!\"\n\n\"How changed it is!\" I said again.\n\n\"Why, so it is,\" he answered much more cheerfully; \"and it is \nwisdom in you to keep me to the bright side of the picture.\"  (The \nidea of my wisdom!)  \"These are things I never talk about or even \nthink about, excepting in the growlery here.  If you consider it \nright to mention them to Rick and Ada,\" looking seriously at me, \n\"you can.  I leave it to your discretion, Esther.\"\n\n\"I hope, sir--\" said I.\n\n\"I think you had better call me guardian, my dear.\"\n\nI felt that I was choking again--I taxed myself with it, \"Esther, \nnow, you know you are!\"--when he feigned to say this slightly, as \nif it were a whim instead of a thoughtful tenderness.  But I gave \nthe housekeeping keys the least shake in the world as a reminder to \nmyself, and folding my hands in a still more determined manner on \nthe basket, looked at him quietly.\n\n\"I hope, guardian,\" said I, \"that you may not trust too much to my \ndiscretion.  I hope you may not mistake me.  I am afraid it will be \na disappointment to you to know that I am not clever, but it really \nis the truth, and you would soon find it out if I had not the \nhonesty to confess it.\"\n\nHe did not seem at all disappointed; quite the contrary.  He told \nme, with a smile all over his face, that he knew me very well \nindeed and that I was quite clever enough for him.\n\n\"I hope I may turn out so,\" said I, \"but I am much afraid of it, \nguardian.\"\n\n\"You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives \nhere, my dear,\" he returned playfully; \"the little old woman of the \nchild\'s (I don\'t mean Skimpole\'s) rhyme:\n\n\n     \'Little old woman, and whither so high?\'\n     \'To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky.\'\n\n\nYou will sweep them so neatly out of OUR sky in the course of your \nhousekeeping, Esther, that one of these days we shall have to \nabandon the growlery and nail up the door.\"\n\nThis was the beginning of my being called Old Woman, and Little Old \nWoman, and Cobweb, and Mrs. Shipton, and Mother Hubbard, and Dame \nDurden, and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became \nquite lost among them.\n\n\"However,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to return to our gossip.  Here\'s \nRick, a fine young fellow full of promise.  What\'s to be done with \nhim?\"\n\nOh, my goodness, the idea of asking my advice on such a point!\n\n\"Here he is, Esther,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, comfortably putting his \nhands into his pockets and stretching out his legs.  \"He must have \na profession; he must make some choice for himself.  There will be \na world more wiglomeration about it, I suppose, but it must be \ndone.\"\n\n\"More what, guardian?\" said I.\n\n\"More wiglomeration,\" said he.  \"It\'s the only name I know for the \nthing.  He is a ward in Chancery, my dear.  Kenge and Carboy will \nhave something to say about it; Master Somebody--a sort of \nridiculous sexton, digging graves for the merits of causes in a \nback room at the end of Quality Court, Chancery Lane--will have \nsomething to say about it; counsel will have something to say about \nit; the Chancellor will have something to say about it; the \nsatellites will have something to say about it; they will all have \nto be handsomely feed, all round, about it; the whole thing will be \nvastly ceremonious, wordy, unsatisfactory, and expensive, and I \ncall it, in general, wiglomeration.  How mankind ever came to be \nafflicted with wiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people \never fell into a pit of it, I don\'t know; so it is.\"\n\nHe began to rub his head again and to hint that he felt the wind.  \nBut it was a delightful instance of his kindness towards me that \nwhether he rubbed his head, or walked about, or did both, his face \nwas sure to recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine; \nand he was sure to turn comfortable again and put his hands in his \npockets and stretch out his legs.\n\n\"Perhaps it would be best, first of all,\" said I, \"to ask Mr. \nRichard what he inclines to himself.\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" he returned.  \"That\'s what I mean!  You know, just \naccustom yourself to talk it over, with your tact and in your quiet \nway, with him and Ada, and see what you all make of it.  We are \nsure to come at the heart of the matter by your means, little \nwoman.\"\n\nI really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was \nattaining and the number of things that were being confided to me.  \nI had not meant this at all; I had meant that he should speak to \nRichard.  But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would \ndo my best, though I feared (I realty felt it necessary to repeat \nthis) that he thought me much more sagacious than I was.  At which \nmy guardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard.\n\n\"Come!\" he said, rising and pushing back his chair.  \"I think we \nmay have done with the growlery for one day!  Only a concluding \nword.  Esther, my dear, do you wish to ask me anything?\"\n\nHe looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at him and \nfelt sure I understood him.\n\n\"About myself, sir?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Guardian,\" said I, venturing to put my hand, which was suddenly \ncolder than I could have wished, in his, \"nothing!  I am quite sure \nthat if there were anything I ought to know or had any need to \nknow, I should not have to ask you to tell it to me.  If my whole \nreliance and confidence were not placed in you, I must have a hard \nheart indeed.  I have nothing to ask you, nothing in the world.\"\n\nHe drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for Ada.  \nFrom that hour I felt quite easy with him, quite unreserved, quite \ncontent to know no more, quite happy.\n\nWe lived, at first, rather a busy life at Bleak House, for we had \nto become acquainted with many residents in and out of the \nneighbourhood who knew Mr. Jarndyce.  It seemed to Ada and me that \neverybody knew him who wanted to do anything with anybody else\'s \nmoney.  It amazed us when we began to sort his letters and to \nanswer some of them for him in the growlery of a morning to find \nhow the great object of the lives of nearly all his correspondents \nappeared to be to form themselves into committees for getting in \nand laying out money.  The ladies were as desperate as the \ngentlemen; indeed, I think they were even more so.  They threw \nthemselves into committees in the most impassioned manner and \ncollected subscriptions with a vehemence quite extraordinary.  It \nappeared to us that some of them must pass their whole lives in \ndealing out subscription-cards to the whole post-office directory--\nshilling cards, half-crown cards, half-sovereign cards, penny \ncards.  They wanted everything.  They wanted wearing apparel, they \nwanted linen rags, they wanted money, they wanted coals, they \nwanted soup, they wanted interest, they wanted autographs, they \nwanted flannel, they wanted whatever Mr. Jarndyce had--or had not.  \nTheir objects were as various as their demands.  They were going to \nraise new buildings, they were going to pay off debts on old \nbuildings, they were going to establish in a picturesque building \n(engraving of proposed west elevation attached) the Sisterhood of \nMediaeval Marys, they were going to give a testimonial to Mrs. \nJellyby, they were going to have their secretary\'s portrait painted \nand presented to his mother-in-law, whose deep devotion to him was \nwell known, they were going to get up everything, I really believe, \nfrom five hundred thousand tracts to an annuity and from a marble \nmonument to a silver tea-pot.  They took a multitude of titles.  \nThey were the Women of England, the Daughters of Britain, the \nSisters of all the cardinal virtues separately, the Females of \nAmerica, the Ladies of a hundred denominations.  They appeared to \nbe always excited about canvassing and electing.  They seemed to \nour poor wits, and according to their own accounts, to be \nconstantly polling people by tens of thousands, yet never bringing \ntheir candidates in for anything.  It made our heads ache to think, \non the whole, what feverish lives they must lead.\n\nAmong the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious \nbenevolence (if I may use the expression) was a Mrs. Pardiggle, who \nseemed, as I judged from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce, \nto be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby herself.  \nWe observed that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became \nthe subject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr. \nJarndyce and prevented his going any farther, when he had remarked \nthat there were two classes of charitable people; one, the people \nwho did a little and made a great deal of noise; the other, the \npeople who did a great deal and made no noise at all.  We were \ntherefore curious to see Mrs. Pardiggle, suspecting her to be a \ntype of the former class, and were glad when she called one day \nwith her five young sons.\n\nShe was a formidable style of lady with spectacles, a prominent \nnose, and a loud voice, who had the effect of wanting a great deal \nof room.  And she really did, for she knocked down little chairs \nwith her skirts that were quite a great way off.  As only Ada and I \nwere at home, we received her timidly, for she seemed to come in \nlike cold weather and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they \nfollowed.\n\n\"These, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with great volubility \nafter the first salutations, \"are my five boys.  You may have seen \ntheir names in a printed subscription list (perhaps more than one) \nin the possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce.  Egbert, my \neldest (twelve), is the boy who sent out his pocket-money, to the \namount of five and threepence, to the Tockahoopo Indians.  Oswald, \nmy second (ten and a half), is the child who contributed two and \nnine-pence to the Great National Smithers Testimonial.  Francis, my \nthird (nine), one and sixpence halfpenny; Felix, my fourth (seven), \neightpence to the Superannuated Widows; Alfred, my youngest (five), \nhas voluntarily enrolled himself in the Infant Bonds of Joy, and is \npledged never, through life, to use tobacco in any form.\"\n\nWe had never seen such dissatisfied children.  It was not merely \nthat they were weazened and shrivelled--though they were certainly \nthat to--but they looked absolutely ferocious with discontent.  At \nthe mention of the Tockahoopo Indians, I could really have supposed \nEghert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe, he gave \nme such a savage frown.  The face of each child, as the amount of \nhis contribution was mentioned, darkened in a peculiarly vindictive \nmanner, but his was by far the worst.  I must except, however, the \nlittle recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy, who was stolidly and \nevenly miserable.\n\n\"You have been visiting, I understand,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"at \nMrs. Jellyby\'s?\"\n\nWe said yes, we had passed one night there.\n\n\"Mrs. Jellyby,\" pursued the lady, always speaking in the same \ndemonstrative, loud, hard tone, so that her voice impressed my \nfancy as if it had a sort of spectacles on too--and I may take the \nopportunity of remarking that her spectacles were made the less \nengaging by her eyes being what Ada called \"choking eyes,\" meaning \nvery prominent--\"Mrs. Jellyby is a benefactor to society and \ndeserves a helping hand.  My boys have contributed to the African \nproject--Egbert, one and six, being the entire allowance of nine \nweeks; Oswald, one and a penny halfpenny, being the same; the rest, \naccording to their little means.  Nevertheless, I do not go with \nMrs. Jellyby in all things.  I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her \ntreatment of her young family.  It has been noticed.  It has been \nobserved that her young family are excluded from participation in \nthe objects to which she is devoted.  She may be right, she may be \nwrong; but, right or wrong, this is not my course with MY young \nfamily.  I take them everywhere.\"\n\nI was afterwards convinced (and so was Ada) that from the ill-\nconditioned eldest child, these words extorted a sharp yell.  He \nturned it off into a yawn, but it began as a yell.\n\n\"They attend matins with me (very prettily done) at half-past six \no\'clock in the morning all the year round, including of course the \ndepth of winter,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly, \"and they are with \nme during the revolving duties of the day.  I am a School lady, I \nam a Visiting lady, I am a Reading lady, I am a Distributing lady; \nI am on the local Linen Box Committee and many general committees; \nand my canvassing alone is very extensive--perhaps no one\'s more \nso.  But they are my companions everywhere; and by these means they \nacquire that knowledge of the poor, and that capacity of doing \ncharitable business in general--in short, that taste for the sort \nof thing--which will render them in after life a service to their \nneighbours and a satisfaction to themselves.  My young family are \nnot frivolous; they expend the entire amount of their allowance in \nsubscriptions, under my direction; and they have attended as many \npublic meetings and listened to as many lectures, orations, and \ndiscussions as generally fall to the lot of few grown people.  \nAlfred (five), who, as I mentioned, has of his own election joined \nthe Infant Bonds of Joy, was one of the very few children who \nmanifested consciousness on that occasion after a fervid address of \ntwo hours from the chairman of the evening.\"\n\nAlfred glowered at us as if he never could, or would, forgive the \ninjury of that night.\n\n\"You may have observed, Miss Summerson,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"in \nsome of the lists to which I have referred, in the possession of \nour esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce, that the names of my young family \nare concluded with the name of O. A. Pardiggle, F.R.S., one pound.  \nThat is their father.  We usually observe the same routine.  I put \ndown my mite first; then my young family enrol their contributions, \naccording to their ages and their little means; and then Mr. \nPardiggle brings up the rear.  Mr. Pardiggle is happy to throw in \nhis limited donation, under my direction; and thus things are made \nnot only pleasant to ourselves, but, we trust, improving to \nothers.\"\n\nSuppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby, and suppose \nMr. Jellyby were to relieve his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle, \nwould Mr. Pardiggle, in return, make any confidential communication \nto Mr. Jellyby?  I was quite confused to find myself thinking this, \nbut it came into my head.\n\n\"You are very pleasantly situated here!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle.\n\nWe were glad to change the subject, and going to the window, \npointed out the beauties of the prospect, on which the spectacles \nappeared to me to rest with curious indifference.\n\n\"You know Mr. Gusher?\" said our visitor.\n\nWe were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher\'s \nacquaintance.\n\n\"The loss is yours, I assure you,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with her \ncommanding deportment.  \"He is a very fervid, impassioned speaker-\nfull of fire!  Stationed in a waggon on this lawn, now, which, from \nthe shape of the land, is naturally adapted to a public meeting, he \nwould improve almost any occasion you could mention for hours and \nhours!  By this time, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, moving \nback to her chair and overturning, as if by invisible agency, a \nlittle round table at a considerable distance with my work-basket \non it, \"by this time you have found me out, I dare say?\"\n\nThis was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at me in \nperfect dismay.  As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness \nafter what I had been thinking, it must have been expressed in the \ncolour of my cheeks.\n\n\"Found out, I mean,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"the prominent point in \nmy character.  I am aware that it is so prominent as to be \ndiscoverable immediately.  I lay myself open to detection, I know.  \nWell!  I freely admit, I am a woman of business.  I love hard work; \nI enjoy hard work.  The excitement does me good.  I am so \naccustomed and inured to hard work that I don\'t know what fatigue \nis.\"\n\nWe murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying, or \nsomething to that effect.  I don\'t think we knew what it was \neither, but this is what our politeness expressed.\n\n\"I do not understand what it is to be tired; you cannot tire me if \nyou try!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle.  \"The quantity of exertion (which is \nno exertion to me), the amount of business (which I regard as \nnothing), that I go through sometimes astonishes myself.  I have \nseen my young family, and Mr. Pardiggle, quite worn out with \nwitnessing it, when I may truly say I have been as fresh as a \nlark!\"\n\nIf that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he \nhad already looked, this was the time when he did it.  I observed \nthat he doubled his right fist and delivered a secret blow into the \ncrown of his cap, which was under his left arm.\n\n\"This gives me a great advantage when I am making my rounds,\" said \nMrs. Pardiggle.  \"If I find a person unwilling to hear what I have \nto say, I tell that person directly, \'I am incapable of fatigue, my \ngood friend, I am never tired, and I mean to go on until I have \ndone.\'  It answers admirably!  Miss Summerson, I hope I shall have \nyour assistance in my visiting rounds immediately, and Miss Clare\'s \nvery soon.\"\n\nAt first I tried to excuse myself for the present on the general \nground of having occupations to attend to which I must not neglect.  \nBut as this was an ineffectual protest, I then said, more \nparticularly, that I was not sure of my qualifications.  That I was \ninexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very \ndifferently situated, and addressing them from suitable points of \nview.  That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which \nmust be essential to such a work.  That I had much to learn, \nmyself, before I could teach others, and that I could not confide \nin my good intentions alone.  For these reasons I thought it best \nto be as useful as I could, and to render what kind services I \ncould to those immediately about me, and to try to let that circle \nof duty gradually and naturally expand itself.  All this I said \nwith anything but confidence, because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older \nthan I, and had great experience, and was so very military in her \nmanners.\n\n\"You are wrong, Miss Summerson,\" said she, \"but perhaps you are not \nequal to hard work or the excitement of it, and that makes a vast \ndifference.  If you would like to see how I go through my work, I \nam now about--with my young family--to visit a brickmaker in the \nneighbourhood (a very bad character) and shall be glad to take you \nwith me.  Miss Clare also, if she will do me the favour.\"\n\nAda and I interchanged looks, and as we were going out in any case, \naccepted the offer.  When we hastily returned from putting on our \nbonnets, we found the young family languishing in a corner and Mrs. \nPardiggle sweeping about the room, knocking down nearly all the \nlight objects it contained.  Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada, \nand I followed with the family.\n\nAda told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud \ntone (that, indeed, I overheard) all the way to the brickmaker\'s \nabout an exciting contest which she had for two or three years \nwaged against another lady relative to the bringing in of their \nrival candidates for a pension somewhere.  There had been a \nquantity of printing, and promising, and proxying, and polling, and \nit appeared to have imparted great liveliness to all concerned, \nexcept the pensioners--who were not elected yet.\n\nI am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in \nbeing usually favoured in that respect, but on this occasion it \ngave me great uneasiness.  As soon as we were out of doors, Egbert, \nwith the manner of a little footpad, demanded a shilling of me on \nthe ground that his pocket-money was \"boned\" from him.  On my \npointing out the great impropriety of the word, especially in \nconnexion with his parent (for he added sulkily \"By her!\"), he \npinched me and said, \"Oh, then!  Now!  Who are you!  YOU wouldn\'t \nlike it, I think?  What does she make a sham for, and pretend to \ngive me money, and take it away again?  Why do you call it my \nallowance, and never let me spend it?\"  These exasperating \nquestions so inflamed his mind and the minds of Oswald and Francis \nthat they all pinched me at once, and in a dreadfully expert way--\nscrewing up such little pieces of my arms that I could hardly \nforbear crying out.  Felix, at the same time, stamped upon my toes.  \nAnd the Bond of Joy, who on account of always having the whole of \nhis little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to abstain from \ncakes as well as tobacco, so swelled with grief and rage when we \npassed a pastry-cook\'s shop that he terrified me by becoming \npurple.  I never underwent so much, both in body and mind, in the \ncourse of a walk with young people as from these unnaturally \nconstrained children when they paid me the compliment of being \nnatural.\n\nI was glad when we came to the brickmaker\'s house, though it was \none of a cluster of wretched hovels in a brick-field, with pigsties \nclose to the broken windows and miserable little gardens before the \ndoors growing nothing but stagnant pools.  Here and there an old \ntub was put to catch the droppings of rain-water from a roof, or \nthey were banked up with mud into a little pond like a large dirt-\npie.  At the doors and windows some men and women lounged or \nprowled about, and took little notice of us except to laugh to one \nanother or to say something as we passed about gentlefolks minding \ntheir own business and not troubling their heads and muddying their \nshoes with coming to look after other people\'s.\n\nMrs. Pardiggle, leading the way with a great show of moral \ndetermination and talking with much volubility about the untidy \nhabits of the people (though I doubted if the best of us could have \nbeen tidy in such a place), conducted us into a cottage at the \nfarthest corner, the ground-floor room of which we nearly filled.  \nBesides ourselves, there were in this damp, offensive room a woman \nwith a black eye, nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire; a \nman, all stained with clay and mud and looking very dissipated, \nlying at full length on the ground, smoking a pipe; a powerful \nyoung man fastening a collar on a dog; and a bold girl doing some \nkind of washing in very dirty water.  They all looked up at us as \nwe came in, and the woman seemed to turn her face towards the fire \nas if to hide her bruised eye; nobody gave us any welcome.\n\n\"Well, my friends,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, but her voice had not a \nfriendly sound, I thought; it was much too businesslike and \nsystematic.  \"How do you do, all of you?  I am here again.  I told \nyou, you couldn\'t tire me, you know.  I am fond of hard work, and \nam true to my word.\"\n\n\"There an\'t,\" growled the man on the floor, whose head rested on \nhis hand as he stared at us, \"any more on you to come in, is \nthere?\"\n\n\"No, my friend,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, seating herself on one stool \nand knocking down another.  \"We are all here.\"\n\n\"Because I thought there warn\'t enough of you, perhaps?\" said the \nman, with his pipe between his lips as he looked round upon us.\n\nThe young man and the girl both laughed.  Two friends of the young \nman, whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with \ntheir hands in their pockets, echoed the laugh noisily.\n\n\"You can\'t tire me, good people,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle to these \nlatter.  \"I enjoy hard work, and the harder you make mine, the \nbetter I like it.\"\n\n\"Then make it easy for her!\" growled the man upon the floor.  \"I \nwants it done, and over.  I wants a end of these liberties took \nwith my place.  I wants an end of being drawed like a badger.  Now \nyou\'re a-going to poll-pry and question according to custom--I know \nwhat you\'re a-going to be up to.  Well!  You haven\'t got no \noccasion to be up to it.  I\'ll save you the trouble.  Is my \ndaughter a-washin?  Yes, she IS a-washin.  Look at the water.  \nSmell it!  That\'s wot we drinks.  How do you like it, and what do \nyou think of gin instead!  An\'t my place dirty?  Yes, it is dirty--\nit\'s nat\'rally dirty, and it\'s nat\'rally onwholesome; and we\'ve had \nfive dirty and onwholesome children, as is all dead infants, and so \nmuch the better for them, and for us besides.  Have I read the \nlittle book wot you left?  No, I an\'t read the little book wot you \nleft.  There an\'t nobody here as knows how to read it; and if there \nwos, it wouldn\'t be suitable to me.  It\'s a book fit for a babby, \nand I\'m not a babby.  If you was to leave me a doll, I shouldn\'t \nnuss it.  How have I been conducting of myself?  Why, I\'ve been \ndrunk for three days; and I\'da been drunk four if I\'da had the \nmoney.  Don\'t I never mean for to go to church?  No, I don\'t never \nmean for to go to church.  I shouldn\'t be expected there, if I did; \nthe beadle\'s too gen-teel for me.  And how did my wife get that \nblack eye?  Why, I give it her; and if she says I didn\'t, she\'s a \nlie!\"\n\nHe had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this, and he now \nturned over on his other side and smoked again.  Mrs. Pardiggle, \nwho had been regarding him through her spectacles with a forcible \ncomposure, calculated, I could not help thinking, to increase his \nantagonism, pulled out a good book as if it were a constable\'s \nstaff and took the whole family into custody.  I mean into \nreligious custody, of course; but she really did it as if she were \nan inexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station-\nhouse.\n\nAda and I were very uncomfortable.  We both felt intrusive and out \nof place, and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on \ninfinitely better if she had not had such a mechanical way of \ntaking possession of people.  The children sulked and stared; the \nfamily took no notice of us whatever, except when the young man \nmade the dog bark, which he usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was \nmost emphatic.  We both felt painfully sensible that between us and \nthese people there was an iron barrier which could not be removed \nby our new friend.  By whom or how it could be removed, we did not \nknow, but we knew that.  Even what she read and said seemed to us \nto be ill-chosen for such auditors, if it had been imparted ever so \nmodestly and with ever so much tact.  As to the little book to \nwhich the man on the floor had referred, we acqulred a knowledge of \nit afterwards, and Mr. Jarndyce said he doubted if Robinson Crusoe \ncould have read it, though he had had no other on his desolate \nisland.\n\nWe were much relieved, under these circumstances, when Mrs. \nPardiggle left off.\n\nThe man on the floor, then turning his bead round again, said \nmorosely, \"Well!  You\'ve done, have you?\"\n\n\"For to-day, I have, my friend.  But I am never fatigued.  I shall \ncome to you again in your regular order,\" returned Mrs. Pardiggle \nwith demonstrative cheerfulness.\n\n\"So long as you goes now,\" said he, folding his arms and shutting \nhis eyes with an oath, \"you may do wot you like!\"\n\nMrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the \nconfined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped.  \nTaking one of her young family in each hand, and telling the others \nto follow closely, and expressing her hope that the brickmaker and \nall his house would be improved when she saw them next, she then \nproceeded to another cottage.  I hope it is not unkind in me to say \nthat she certainly did make, in this as in everything else, a show \nthat was not conciliatory of doing charity by wholesale and of \ndealing in it to a large extent.\n\nShe supposed that we were following her, but as soon as the space \nwas left clear, we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask \nif the baby were ill.\n\nShe only looked at it as it lay on her lap.  We had observed before \nthat when she looked at it she covered her discoloured eye with her \nhand, as though she wished to separate any association with noise \nand violence and ill treatment from the poor little child.\n\nAda, whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance, bent down to \ntouch its little face.  As she did so, I saw what happened and drew \nher back.  The child died.\n\n\"Oh, Esther!\" cried Ada, sinking on her knees beside it.  \"Look \nhere!  Oh, Esther, my love, the little thing!  The suffering, \nquiet, pretty little thing!  I am so sorry for it.  I am so sorry \nfor the mother.  I never saw a sight so pitiful as this before!  \nOh, baby, baby!\"\n\nSuch compassion, such gentleness, as that with which she bent down \nweeping and put her hand upon the mother\'s might have softened any \nmother\'s heart that ever beat.  The woman at first gazed at her in \nastonishment and then burst into tears.\n\nPresently I took the light burden from her lap, did what I could to \nmake the baby\'s rest the prettier and gentler, laid it on a shelf, \nand covered it with my own handkerchief.  We tried to comfort the \nmother, and we whispered to her what Our Saviour said of children.  \nShe answered nothing, but sat weeping--weeping very much.\n\nWhen I turned, I found that the young man had taken out the dog and \nwas standing at the door looking in upon us with dry eyes, but \nquiet.  The girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the \nground.  The man had risen.  He still smoked his pipe with an air \nof defiance, but he was silent.\n\nAn ugly woman, very poorly clothed, hurried in while I was glancing \nat them, and coming straight up to the mother, said, \"Jenny!  \nJenny!\"  The mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the \nwoman\'s neck.\n\nShe also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill usage.  She \nhad no kind of grace about her, but the grace of sympathy; but when \nshe condoled with the woman, and her own tears fell, she wanted no \nbeauty.  I say condoled, but her only words were \"Jenny!  Jenny!\"  \nAll the rest was in the tone in which she said them.\n\nI thought it very touching to see these two women, coarse and \nshabby and beaten, so united; to see what they could be to one \nanother; to see how they felt for one another, how the heart of \neach to each was softened by the hard trials of their lives.  I \nthink the best side of such people is almost hidden from us.  What \nthe poor are to the poor is little known, excepting to themselves \nand God.\n\nWe felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted.  We \nstole out quietly and without notice from any one except the man.  \nHe was leaning against the wall near the door, and finding that \nthere was scarcely room for us to pass, went out before us.  He \nseemed to want to hide that he did this on our account, but we \nperceived that be did, and thanked him.  He made no answer.\n\nAda was so full of grief all the way home, and Richard, whom we \nfound at home, was so distressed to see her in tears (though he \nsaid to me, when she was not present, how beautiful it was too!), \nthat we arranged to return at night with some little comforts and \nrepeat our visit at the brick-maker\'s house.  We said as little as \nwe could to Mr. Jarndyce, but the wind changed directly.\n\nRichard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning \nexpedition.  On our way there, we had to pass a noisy drinking-\nhouse, where a number of men were flocking about the door.  Among \nthem, and prominent in some dispute, was the father of the little \nchild.  At a short distance, we passed the young man and the dog, \nin congenial company.  The sister was standing laughing and talking \nwith some other young women at the corner of the row of cottages, \nbut she seemed ashamed and turned away as we went by.\n\nWe left our escort within sight of the brickmaker\'s dwelling and \nproceeded by ourselves.  When we came to the door, we found the \nwoman who had brought such consolation with her standing there \nlooking anxiously out.\n\n\"It\'s you, young ladies, is it?\" she said in a whisper.  \"I\'m a-\nwatching for my master.  My heart\'s in my mouth.  If he was to \ncatch me away from home, he\'d pretty near murder me.\"\n\n\"Do you mean your husband?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, miss, my master.  Jennys asleep, quite worn out.  She\'s \nscarcely had the child off her lap, poor thing, these seven days \nand nights, except when I\'ve been able to take it for a minute or \ntwo.\"\n\nAs she gave way for us, she went softly in and put what we had \nbrought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept.  No \neffort had been made to clean the room--it seemed in its nature \nalmost hopeless of being clean; but the small waxen form from which \nso much solemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh, and \nwashed, and neatly dressed in some fragments of white linen; and on \nmy handkerchief, which still covered the poor baby, a little bunch \nof sweet herbs had been laid by the same rough, scarred hands, so \nlightly, so tenderly!\n\n\"May heaven reward you!\" we said to her.  \"You are a good woman.\"\n\n\"Me, young ladies?\" she returned with surprise.  \"Hush!  Jenny, \nJenny!\"\n\nThe mother had moaned in her sleep and moved.  The sound of the \nfamiliar voice seemed to calm her again.  She was quiet once more.\n\nHow little I thought, when I raised my handkerchief to look upon \nthe tiny sleeper underneath and seemed to see a halo shine around \nthe child through Ada\'s drooping hair as her pity bent her head--\nhow little I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would \ncome to lie after covering the motionless and peaceful breast!  I \nonly thought that perhaps the Angel of the child might not be all \nunconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a \nhand; not all unconscious of her presently, when we had taken \nleave, and left her at the door, by turns looking, and listening in \nterror for herself, and saying in her old soothing manner, \"Jenny, \nJenny!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nSigns and Tokens\n\n\nI don\'t know how it is I seem to be always writing about myself.  I \nmean all the time to write about other people, and I try to think \nabout myself as little as possible, and I am sure, when I find \nmyself coming into the story again, I am really vexed and say, \n\"Dear, dear, you tiresome little creature, I wish you wouldn\'t!\" \nbut it is all of no use.  I hope any one who may read what I write \nwill understand that if these pages contain a great deal about me, \nI can only suppose it must be because I have really something to do \nwith them and can\'t be kept out.\n\nMy darling and I read together, and worked, and practised, and \nfound so much employment for our time that the winter days flew by \nus like bright-winged birds.  Generally in the afternoons, and \nalways in the evenings, Richard gave us his company.  Although he \nwas one of the most restless creatures in the world, he certainly \nwas very fond of our society.\n\nHe was very, very, very fond of Ada.  I mean it, and I had better \nsay it at once.  I had never seen any young people falling in love \nbefore, but I found them out quite soon.  I could not say so, of \ncourse, or show that I knew anything about it.  On the contrary, I \nwas so demure and used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I \nconsidered within myself while I was sitting at work whether I was \nnot growing quite deceitful.\n\nBut there was no help for it.  All I had to do was to be quiet, and \nI was as quiet as a mouse.  They were as quiet as mice too, so far \nas any words were concerned, but the innocent manner in which they \nrelied more and more upon me as they took more and more to one \nanother was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing \nhow it interested me.\n\n\"Our dear little old woman is such a capital old woman,\" Richard \nwould say, coming up to meet me in the garden early, with his \npleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush, \"that I \ncan\'t get on without her.  Before I begin my harum-scarum day--\ngrinding away at those books and instruments and then galloping up \nhill and down dale, all the country round, like a highwayman--it \ndoes me so much good to come and have a steady walk with our \ncomfortable friend, that here I am again!\"\n\n\"You know, Dame Durden, dear,\" Ada would say at night, with her \nhead upon my shoulder and the firelight shining in her thoughtful \neyes, \"I don\'t want to talk when we come upstairs here.  Only to \nsit a little while thinking, with your dear face for company, and \nto hear the wind and remember the poor sailors at sea--\"\n\nAh!  Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor.  We had talked it \nover very often now, and there was some talk of gratifying the \ninclination of his childhood for the sea.  Mr. Jarndyce had written \nto a relation of the family, a great Sir Leicester Dedlock, for his \ninterest in Richard\'s favour, generally; and Sir Leicester had \nreplied in a gracious manner that he would be happy to advance the \nprospects of the young gentleman if it should ever prove to be \nwithin his power, which was not at all probable, and that my Lady \nsent her compliments to the young gentleman (to whom she perfectly \nremembered that she was allied by remote consanguinity) and trusted \nthat he would ever do his duty in any honourable profession to \nwhich he might devote himself.\n\n\"So I apprehend it\'s pretty clear,\" said Richard to me, \"that I \nshall have to work my own way.  Never mind!  Plenty of people have \nhad to do that before now, and have done it.  I only wish I had the \ncommand of a clipping privateer to begin with and could carry off \nthe Chancellor and keep him on short allowance until he gave \njudgment in our cause.  He\'d find himself growing thin, if he \ndidn\'t look sharp!\"\n\nWith a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever \nflagged, Richard had a carelessness in his character that quite \nperplexed me, principally because he mistook it, in such a very odd \nway, for prudence.  It entered into all his calculations about \nmoney in a singular manner which I don\'t think I can better explain \nthan by reverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole.\n\nMr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount, either from Mr. Skimpole \nhimself or from Coavinses, and had placed the money in my hands \nwith instructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the \nrest to Richard.  The number of little acts of thoughtless \nexpenditure which Richard justified by the recovery of his ten \npounds, and the number of times he talked to me as if he had saved \nor realized that amount, would form a sum in simple addition.\n\n\"My prudent Mother Hubbard, why not?\" he said to me when he wanted, \nwithout the least consideration, to bestow five pounds on the \nbrickmaker.  \"I made ten pounds, clear, out of Coavinses\' \nbusiness.\"\n\n\"How was that?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, I got rid of ten pounds which I was quite content to get rid \nof and never expected to see any more.  You don\'t deny that?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I.\n\n\"Very well!  Then I came into possession of ten pounds--\"\n\n\"The same ten pounds,\" I hinted.\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it!\" returned Richard.  \"I have got \nten pounds more than I expected to have, and consequently I can \nafford to spend it without being particular.\"\n\nIn exactly the same way, when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice \nof these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good, \nhe carried that sum to his credit and drew upon it.\n\n\"Let me see!\" he would say.  \"I saved five pounds out of the \nbrickmaker\'s affair, so if I have a good rattle to London and back \nin a post-chaise and put that down at four pounds, I shall have \nsaved one.  And it\'s a very good thing to save one, let me tell \nyou: a penny saved is a penny got!\"\n\nI believe Richard\'s was as frank and generous a nature as there \npossibly can be.  He was ardent and brave, and in the midst of all \nhis wild restlessness, was so gentle that I knew him like a brother \nin a few weeks.  His gentleness was natural to him and would have \nshown itself abundantly even without Ada\'s influence; but with it, \nhe became one of the most winning of companions, always so ready to \nbe interested and always so happy, sanguine, and light-hearted.  I \nam sure that I, sitting with them, and walking with them, and \ntalking with them, and noticing from day to day how they went on, \nfalling deeper and deeper in love, and saying nothing about it, and \neach shyly thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets, \nperhaps not yet suspected even by the other--I am sure that I was \nscarcely less enchanted than they were and scarcely less pleased \nwith the pretty dream.\n\nWe were going on in this way, when one morning at breakfast Mr. \nJarndyce received a letter, and looking at the superscription, \nsaid, \"From Boythorn?  Aye, aye!\" and opened and read it with \nevident pleasure, announcing to us in a parenthesis when he was \nabout half-way through, that Boythorn was \"coming down\" on a visit.  \nNow who was Boythorn, we all thought.  And I dare say we all \nthought too--I am sure I did, for one--would Boythorn at all \ninterfere with what was going forward?\n\n\"I went to school with this fellow, Lawrence Boythorn,\" said Mr. \nJarndyce, tapping the letter as he laid it on the table, \"more than \nfive and forty years ago.  He was then the most impetuous boy in \nthe world, and he is now the most impetuous man.  He was then the \nloudest boy in the world, and he is now the loudest man.  He was \nthen the heartiest and sturdiest boy in the world, and he is now \nthe heartiest and sturdiest man.  He is a tremendous fellow.\"\n\n\"In stature, sir?\" asked Richard.\n\n\"Pretty well, Rick, in that respect,\" said Mr. Jarndyce; \"being \nsome ten years older than I and a couple of inches taller, with his \nhead thrown back like an old soldier, his stalwart chest squared, \nhis hands like a clean blacksmith\'s, and his lungs!  There\'s no \nsimile for his lungs.  Talking, laughing, or snoring, they make the \nbeams of the house shake.\"\n\nAs Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his friend Boythorn, we \nobserved the favourable omen that there was not the least \nindication of any change in the wind.\n\n\"But it\'s the inside of the man, the warm heart of the man, the \npassion of the man, the fresh blood of the man, Rick--and Ada, and \nlittle Cobweb too, for you are all interested in a visitor--that I \nspeak of,\" he pursued.  \"His language is as sounding as his voice.  \nHe is always in extremes, perpetually in the superlative degree.  \nIn his condemnation he is all ferocity.  You might suppose him to \nbe an ogre from what he says, and I believe he has the reputation \nof one with some people.  There!  I tell you no more of him \nbeforehand.  You must not be surprised to see him take me under his \nprotection, for he has never forgotten that I was a low boy at \nschool and that our friendship began in his knocking two of my head \ntyrant\'s teeth out (he says six) before breakfast.  Boythorn and \nhis man,\" to me, \"will be here this afternoon, my dear.\"\n\nI took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr. \nBoythorn\'s reception, and we looked forward to his arrival with \nsome curiosity.  The afternoon wore away, however, and he did not \nappear.  The dinner-hour arrived, and still he did not appear.  The \ndinner was put back an hour, and we were sitting round the fire \nwith no light but the blaze when the hall-door suddenly burst open \nand the hall resounded with these words, uttered with the greatest \nvehemence and in a stentorian tone: \"We have been misdirected, \nJarndyce, by a most abandoned ruffian, who told us to take the \nturning to the right instead of to the left.  He is the most \nintolerable scoundrel on the face of the earth.  His father must \nhave been a most consummate villain, ever to have such a son.  I \nwould have had that fellow shot without the least remorse!\"\n\n\"Did he do it on purpose?\" Mr. Jarndyce inquired.\n\n\"I have not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel has passed his \nwhole existence in misdirecting travellers!\" returned the other.  \n\"By my soul, I thought him the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld \nwhen he was telling me to take the turning to the right.  And yet I \nstood before that fellow face to face and didn\'t knock his brains \nout!\"\n\n\"Teeth, you mean?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, really making the \nwhole house vibrate.  \"What, you have not forgotten it yet!  Ha, \nha, ha!  And that was another most consummate vagabond!  By my \nsoul, the countenance of that fellow when he was a boy was the \nblackest image of perfidy, cowardice, and cruelty ever set up as a \nscarecrow in a field of scoundrels.  If I were to meet that most \nunparalleled despot in the streets to-morrow, I would fell him like \na rotten tree!\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.  \"Now, will you come \nupstairs?\"\n\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" returned his guest, who seemed to refer to \nhis watch, \"if you had been married, I would have turned back at \nthe garden-gate and gone away to the remotest summits of the \nHimalaya Mountains sooner than I would have presented myself at \nthis unseasonable hour.\"\n\n\"Not quite so far, I hope?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"By my life and honour, yes!\" cried the visitor.  \"I wouldn\'t be \nguilty of the audacious insolence of keeping a lady of the house \nwaiting all this time for any earthly consideration.  I would \ninfinitely rather destroy myself--infinitely rather!\"\n\nTalking thus, they went upstairs, and presently we heard him in his \nbedroom thundering \"Ha, ha, ha!\" and again \"Ha, ha, ha!\" until the \nflattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion \nand to laugh as enjoyingly as he did or as we did when we heard him \nlaugh.\n\nWe all conceived a prepossession in his favour, for there was a \nsterling quality in this laugh, and in his vigorous, healthy voice, \nand in the roundness and fullness with which he uttered every word \nhe spoke, and in the very fury of his superlatives, which seemed to \ngo off like blank cannons and hurt nothing.  But we were hardly \nprepared to have it so confirmed by his appearance when Mr. \nJarndyce presented him.  He was not only a very handsome old \ngentleman--upright and stalwart as he had been described to us--\nwith a massive grey head, a fine composure of face when silent, a \nfigure that might have become corpulent but for his being so \ncontinually in earnest that he gave it no rest, and a chin that \nmight have subsided into a double chin but for the vehement \nemphasis in which it was constantly required to assist; but he was \nsuch a true gentleman in his manner, so chivalrously polite, his \nface was lighted by a smile of so much sweetness and tenderness, \nand it seemed so plain that he had nothing to hide, but showed \nhimself exactly as he was--incapable, as Richard said, of anything \non a limited scale, and firing away with those blank great guns \nbecause he carried no small arms whatever--that really I could not \nhelp looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat at dinner, \nwhether he smilingly conversed with Ada and me, or was led by Mr. \nJarndyce into some great volley of superlatives, or threw up his \nhead like a bloodhound and gave out that tremendous \"Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\n\"You have brought your bird with you, I suppose?\" said Mr. \nJarndyce.\n\n\"By heaven, he is the most astonishing bird in Europe!\" replied the \nother.  \"He IS the most wonderful creature!  I wouldn\'t take ten \nthousand guineas for that bird.  I have left an annuity for his \nsole support in case he should outlive me.  He is, in sense and \nattachment, a phenomenon.  And his father before him was one of the \nmost astonishing birds that ever lived!\"\n\nThe subject of this laudation was a very little canary, who was so \ntame that he was brought down by Mr. Boythorn\'s man, on his \nforefinger, and after taking a gentle flight round the room, \nalighted on his master\'s head.  To hear Mr. Boythorn presently \nexpressing the most implacable and passionate sentiments, with this \nfragile mite of a creature quietly perched on his forehead, was to \nhave a good illustration of his character, I thought.\n\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" he said, very gently holding up a bit of \nbread to the canary to peck at, \"if I were in your place I would \nseize every master in Chancery by the throat tomorrow morning and \nshake him until his money rolled out of his pockets and his bones \nrattled in his skin.  I would have a settlement out of somebody, by \nfair means or by foul.  If you would empower me to do it, I would \ndo it for you with the greatest satisfaction!\"  (All this time the \nvery small canary was eating out of his hand.)\n\n\"I thank you, Lawrence, but the suit is hardly at such a point at \npresent,\" returned Mr. Jarndyce, laughing, \"that it would be \ngreatly advanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and \nthe whole bar.\"\n\n\"There never was such an infernal cauldron as that Chancery on the \nface of the earth!\" said Mr. Boythorn.  \"Nothing but a mine below \nit on a busy day in term time, with all its records, rules, and \nprecedents collected in it and every functionary belonging to it \nalso, high and low, upward and downward, from its son the \nAccountant-General to its father the Devil, and the whole blown to \natoms with ten thousand hundredweight of gunpowder, would reform it \nin the least!\"\n\nIt was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which \nhe recommended this strong measure of reform.  When we laughed, he \nthrew up his head and shook his broad chest, and again the whole \ncountry seemed to echo to his \"Ha, ha, ha!\"  It had not the least \neffect in disturbing the bird, whose sense of security was complete \nand who hopped about the table with its quick head now on this side \nand now on that, turning its bright sudden eye on its master as if \nhe were no more than another bird.\n\n\"But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right \nof way?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.  \"You are not free from the toils of \nthe law yourself!\"\n\n\"The fellow has brought actions against ME for trespass, and I have \nbrought actions against HIM for trespass,\" returned Mr. Boythorn.  \n\"By heaven, he is the proudest fellow breathing.  It is morally \nimpossible that his name can be Sir Leicester.  It must be Sir \nLucifer.\"\n\n\"Complimentary to our distant relation!\" said my guardian \nlaughingly to Ada and Richard.\n\n\"I would beg Miss Clare\'s pardon and Mr. Carstone\'s pardon,\" \nresumed our visitor, \"if I were not reassured by seeing in the fair \nface of the lady and the smile of the gentleman that it is quite \nunnecessary and that they keep their distant relation at a \ncomfortable distance.\"\n\n\"Or he keeps us,\" suggested Richard.\n\n\"By my soul,\" exclaimed Mr. Boythorn, suddenly firing another \nvolley, \"that fellow is, and his father was, and his grandfather \nwas, the most stiff-necked, arrogant imbecile, pig-headed numskull, \never, by some inexplicable mistake of Nature, born in any station \nof life but a walking-stick\'s!  The whole of that family are the \nmost solemnly conceited and consummate blockheads!  But it\'s no \nmatter; he should not shut up my path if he were fifty baronets \nmelted into one and living in a hundred Chesney Wolds, one within \nanother, like the ivory balls in a Chinese carving.  The fellow, by \nhis agent, or secretary, or somebody, writes to me \'Sir Leicester \nDedlock, Baronet, presents his compliments to Mr. Lawrence \nBoythorn, and has to call his attention to the fact that the green \npathway by the old parsonage-house, now the property of Mr. \nLawrence Boythorn, is Sir Leicester\'s right of way, being in fact a \nportion of the park of chesney Wold, and that Sir Leicester finds \nit convenient to close up the same.\'  I write to the fellow, \'Mr. \nLawrence Boythorn presents his compliments to Sir Leicester \nDedlock, Baronet, and has to call HIS attention to the fact that he \ntotally denies the whole of Sir Leicester Dedlock\'s positions on \nevery possible subject and has to add, in reference to closing up \nthe pathway, that he will be glad to see the man who may undertake \nto do it.\'  The fellow sends a most abandoned villain with one eye \nto construct a gateway.  I play upon that execrable scoundrel with \na fire-engine until the breath is nearly driven out of his body.  \nThe fellow erects a gate in the night.  I chop it down and burn it \nin the morning.  He sends his myrmidons to come over the fence and \npass and repass.  I catch them in humane man traps, fire split peas \nat their legs, play upon them with the engine--resolve to free \nmankind from the insupportable burden of the existence of those \nlurking ruffians.  He brings actions for trespass; I bring actions \nfor trespass.  He brings actions for assault and battery; I defend \nthem and continue to assault and batter.  Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\nTo hear him say all this with unimaginable energy, one might have \nthought him the angriest of mankind.  To see him at the very same \ntime, looking at the bird now perched upon his thumb and softly \nsmoothing its feathers with his forefinger, one might have thought \nhim the gentlest.  To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature \nof his face then, one might have supposed that he had not a care in \nthe world, or a dispute, or a dislike, but that his whole existence \nwas a summer joke.\n\n\"No, no,\" he said, \"no closing up of my paths by any Dedlock!  \nThough I willingly confess,\" here he softened in a moment, \"that \nLady Dedlock is the most accomplished lady in the world, to whom I \nwould do any homage that a plain gentleman, and no baronet with a \nhead seven hundred years thick, may.  A man who joined his regiment \nat twenty and within a week challenged the most imperious and \npresumptuous coxcomb of a commanding officer that ever drew the \nbreath of life through a tight waist--and got broke for it--is not \nthe man to be walked over by all the Sir Lucifers, dead or alive, \nlocked or unlocked.  Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\n\"Nor the man to allow his junior to be walked over either?\" said my \nguardian.\n\n\"Most assuredly not!\" said Mr. Boythorn, clapping him on the \nshoulder with an air of protection that had something serious in \nit, though he laughed.  \"He will stand by the low boy, always.  \nJarndyce, you may rely upon him!  But speaking of this trespass--\nwith apologies to Miss Clare and Miss Summerson for the length at \nwhich I have pursued so dry a subject--is there nothing for me from \nyour men Kenge and Carboy?\"\n\n\"I think not, Esther?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Nothing, guardian.\"\n\n\"Much obliged!\" said Mr. Boythorn.  \"Had no need to ask, after even \nmy slight experience of Miss Summerson\'s forethought for every one \nabout her.\"  (They all encouraged me; they were determined to do \nit.)  \"I inquired because, coming from Lincolnshire, I of course \nhave not yet been in town, and I thought some letters might have \nbeen sent down here.  I dare say they will report progress to-\nmorrow morning.\"\n\nI saw him so often in the course of the evening, which passed very \npleasantly, contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a \nsatisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat \nat a little distance from the piano listening to the music--and he \nhad small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of \nmusic, for his face showed it--that I asked my guardian as we sat \nat the backgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married.\n\n\"No,\" said he.  \"No.\"\n\n\"But he meant to be!\" said I.\n\n\"How did you find out that?\" he returned with a smile.  \"Why, \nguardian,\" I explained, not without reddening a little at hazarding \nwhat was in my thoughts, \"there is something so tender in his \nmanner, after all, and he is so very courtly and gentle to us, and\n--\"\n\nMr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting as I have \njust described him.\n\nI said no more.\n\n\"You are right, little woman,\" he answered.  \"He was all but \nmarried once.  Long ago.  And once.\"\n\n\"Did the lady die?\"\n\n\"No--but she died to him.  That time has had its influence on all \nhis later life.  Would you suppose him to have a head and a heart \nfull of romance yet?\"\n\n\"I think, guardian, I might have supposed so.  But it is easy to \nsay that when you have told me so.\"\n\n\"He has never since been what he might have been,\" said Mr. \nJarndyce, \"and now you see him in his age with no one near him but \nhis servant and his little yellow friend.  It\'s your throw, my \ndear!\"\n\nI felt, from my guardian\'s manner, that beyond this point I could \nnot pursue the subject without changing the wind.  I therefore \nforbore to ask any further questions.  I was interested, but not \ncurious.  I thought a little while about this old love story in the \nnight, when I was awakened by Mr. Boythorn\'s lusty snoring; and I \ntried to do that very difficult thing, imagine old people young \nagain and invested with the graces of youth.  But I fell asleep \nbefore I had succeeded, and dreamed of the days when I lived in my \ngodmother\'s house.  I am not sufficiently acquainted with such \nsubjects to know whether it is at all remarkable that I almost \nalways dreamed of that period of my life.\n\nWith the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy \nto Mr. Boythorn informing him that one of their clerks would wait \nupon him at noon.  As it was the day of the week on which I paid the \nbills, and added up my books, and made all the household affairs as \ncompact as possible, I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and \nRichard took advantage of a very fine day to make a little \nexcursion, Mr. Boythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy\'s clerk and \nthen was to go on foot to meet them on their return.\n\nWell!  I was full of business, examining tradesmen\'s books, adding \nup columns, paying money, filing receipts, and I dare say making a \ngreat bustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in.  I \nhad had some idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be \nthe young gentleman who had met me at the coach-office, and I was \nglad to see him, because he was associated with my present \nhappiness.\n\nI scarcely knew him again, he was so uncommonly smart.  He had an \nentirely new suit of glossy clothes on, a shining hat, lilac-kid \ngloves, a neckerchief of a variety of colours, a large hot-house \nflower in his button-hole, and a thick gold ring on his little \nfinger.  Besides which, he quite scented the dining-room with \nbear\'s-grease and other perfumery.  He looked at me with an \nattention that quite confused me when I begged him to take a seat \nuntil the servant should return; and as he sat there crossing and \nuncrossing his legs in a corner, and I asked him if he had had a \npleasant ride, and hoped that Mr. Kenge was well, I never looked at \nhim, but I found him looking at me in the same scrutinizing and \ncurious way.\n\nWhen the request was brought to him that he would go up-stairs to \nMr. Boythorn\'s room, I mentioned that he would find lunch prepared \nfor him when he came down, of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he would \npartake.  He said with some embarrassment, holding the handle of the \ndoor, \'\"Shall I have the honour of finding you here, miss?\"  I \nreplied yes, I should be there; and he went out with a bow and \nanother look.\n\nI thought him only awkward and shy, for he was evidently much \nembarrassed; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be \nto wait until I saw that he had everything he wanted and then to \nleave him to himself.  The lunch was soon brought, but it remained \nfor some time on the table.  The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a \nlong one, and a stormy one too, I should think, for although his \nroom was at some distance I heard his loud voice rising every now \nand then like a high wind, and evidently blowing perfect broadsides \nof denunciation.\n\nAt last Mr. Guppy came back, looking something the worse for the \nconference.  \"My eye, miss,\" he said in a low voice, \"he\'s a \nTartar!\"\n\n\"Pray take some refreshment, sir,\" said I.\n\nMr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the \ncarving-knife on the carving-fork, still looking at me (as I felt \nquite sure without looking at him) in the same unusual manner.  The \nsharpening lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation \non me to raise my eyes in order that I might break the spell under \nwhich he seemed to labour, of not being able to leave off.\n\nHe immediately looked at the dish and began to carve.\n\n\"What will you take yourself, miss?  You\'ll take a morsel of \nsomething?\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said I.\n\n\"Shan\'t I give you a piece of anything at all, miss?\" said Mr. \nGuppy, hurriedly drinking off a glass of wine.\n\n\"Nothing, thank you,\" said I.  \"I have only waited to see that you \nhave everything you want.  Is there anything I can order for you?\"\n\n\"No, I am much obliged to you, miss, I\'m sure.  I\'ve everything that \nI can require to make me comfortable--at least I--not comfortable--\nI\'m never that.\"  He drank off two more glasses of wine, one after \nanother.\n\nI thought I had better go.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, rising when he saw me \nrise.  \"But would you allow me the favour of a minute\'s private \nconversation?\"\n\nNot knowing what to say, I sat down again.\n\n\"What follows is without prejudice, miss?\" said Mr. Guppy, anxiously \nbringing a chair towards my table.\n\n\"I don\'t understand what you mean,\" said I, wondering.\n\n\"It\'s one of our law terms, miss.  You won\'t make any use of it to \nmy detriment at Kenge and Carboy\'s or elsewhere.  If our \nconversation shouldn\'t lead to anything, I am to be as I was and am \nnot to be prejudiced in my situation or worldly prospects.  In \nshort, it\'s in total confidence.\"\n\n\"I am at a loss, sir,\" said I, \"to imagine what you can have to \ncommunicate in total confidence to me, whom you have never seen but \nonce; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury.\"\n\n\"Thank you, miss.  I\'m sure of it--that\'s quite sufficient.\"  All \nthis time Mr. Guppy was either planing his forehead with his \nhandkerchief or tightly rubbing the palm of his left hand with the \npalm of his right.  \"If you would excuse my taking another glass of \nwine, miss, I think it might assist me in getting on without a \ncontinual choke that cannot fail to be mutually unpleasant.\"\n\nHe did so, and came back again.  I took the opportunity of moving \nwell behind my table.\n\n\"You wouldn\'t allow me to offer you one, would you miss?\" said Mr. \nGuppy, apparently refreshed.\n\n\"Not any,\" said I.\n\n\"Not half a glass?\" said Mr. Guppy.  \"Quarter?  No!  Then, to \nproceed.  My present salary, Miss Summerson, at Kenge and Carboy\'s, \nis two pound a week.  When I first had the happiness of looking upon \nyou, it was one fifteen, and had stood at that figure for a \nlengthened period.  A rise of five has since taken place, and a \nfurther rise of five is guaranteed at the expiration of a term not \nexceeding twelve months from the present date.  My mother has a \nlittle property, which takes the form of a small life annuity, upon \nwhich she lives in an independent though unassuming manner in the \nOld Street Road.  She is eminently calculated for a mother-in-law.  \nShe never interferes, is all for peace, and her disposition easy.  \nShe has her failings--as who has not?--but I never knew her do it \nwhen company was present, at which time you may freely trust her \nwith wines, spirits, or malt liquors.  My own abode is lodgings at \nPenton Place, Pentonville.  It is lowly, but airy, open at the back, \nand considered one of the \'ealthiest outlets.  Miss Summerson!  In \nthe mildest language, I adore you.  Would you be so kind as to allow \nme (as I may say) to file a declaration--to make an offer!\"\n\nMr. Guppy went down on his knees.  I was well behind my table and \nnot much frightened.  I said, \"Get up from that ridiculous position \nlmmediately, sir, or you will oblige me to break my implied promise \nand ring the bell!\"\n\n\"Hear me out, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, folding his hands.\n\n\"I cannot consent to hear another word, sir,\" I returned, \"Unless \nyou get up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table \nas you ought to do if you have any sense at all.\"\n\nHe looked piteously, but slowly rose and did so.\n\n\"Yet what a mockery it is, miss,\" he said with his hand upon his \nheart and shaking his head at me in a melancholy manner over the \ntray, \"to be stationed behind food at such a moment.  The soul \nrecoils from food at such a moment, miss.\"\n\n\"I beg you to conclude,\" said I; \"you have asked me to hear you out, \nand I beg you to conclude.\"\n\n\"I will, miss,\" said Mr. Guppy.  \"As I love and honour, so likewise \nI obey.  Would that I could make thee the subject of that vow before \nthe shrine!\"\n\n\"That is quite impossible,\" said I, \"and entirely out of the \nquestion.\"\n\n\"I am aware,\" said Mr. Guppy, leaning forward over the tray and \nregarding me, as I again strangely felt, though my eyes were not \ndirected to him, with his late intent look, \"I am aware that in a \nworldly point of view, according to all appearances, my offer is a \npoor one.  But, Miss Summerson!  Angel!  No, don\'t ring--I have been \nbrought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of \ngeneral practice.  Though a young man, I have ferreted out evidence, \ngot up cases, and seen lots of life.  Blest with your hand, what \nmeans might I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your \nfortunes!  What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you?  I \nknow nothing now, certainly; but what MIGHT I not if I had your \nconfidence, and you set me on?\"\n\nI told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be \nmy interest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination, \nand he would now understand that I requested him, if he pleased, to \ngo away immediately.\n\n\"Cruel miss,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"hear but another word!  I think you \nmust have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I \nwaited at the Whytorseller.  I think you must have remarked that I \ncould not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps \nof the \'ackney-coach.  It was a feeble tribute to thee, but it was \nwell meant.  Thy image has ever since been fixed in my breast.  I \nhave walked up and down of an evening opposite Jellyby\'s house only \nto look upon the bricks that once contained thee.  This out of to-\nday, quite an unnecessary out so far as the attendance, which was \nits pretended object, went, was planned by me alone for thee alone.  \nIf I speak of interest, it is only to recommend myself and my \nrespectful wretchedness.  Love was before it, and is before it.\"\n\n\"I should be pained, Mr. Guppy,\" said I, rising and putting my hand \nupon the bell-rope, \"to do you or any one who was sincere the \ninjustice of slighting any honest feeling, however disagreeably \nexpressed.  If you have really meant to give me a proof of your good \nopinion, though ill-timed and misplaced, I feel that I ought to \nthank you.  I have very little reason to be proud, and I am not \nproud.  I hope,\" I think I added, without very well knowing what I \nsaid, \"that you will now go away as if you had never been so \nexceedingly foolish and attend to Messrs. Kenge and Carboy\'s \nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Half a minute, miss!\" cried Mr. Guppy, checking me as I was about \nto ring.  \"This has been without prejudice?\"\n\n\"I will never mention it,\" said I, \"unless you should give me future \noccasion to do so.\"\n\n\"A quarter of a minute, miss!  In case you should think better at \nany time, however distant--THAT\'S no consequence, for my feelings \ncan never alter--of anything I have said, particularly what might I \nnot do, Mr. William Guppy, eighty-seven, Penton Place, or if \nremoved, or dead (of blighted hopes or anything of that sort), care \nof Mrs. Guppy, three hundred and two, Old Street Road, will be \nsufficient.\"\n\nI rang the bell, the servant came, and Mr. Guppy, laying his written \ncard upon the table and making a dejected bow, departed.  Raising my \neyes as he went out, I once more saw him looking at me after he had \npassed the door.\n\nI sat there for another hour or more, finishing my books and \npayments and getting through plenty of business.  Then I arranged my \ndesk, and put everything away, and was so composed and cheerful that \nI thought I had quite dismissed this unexpected incident.  But, when \nI went upstairs to my own room, I surprised myself by beginning to \nlaugh about it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to \ncry about it.  In short, I was in a flutter for a little while and \nfelt as if an old chord had been more coarsely touched than it ever \nhad been since the days of the dear old doll, long buried in the \ngarden.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe Law-Writer\n\n\nOn the eastern borders of Chancery Lane, that is to say, more \nparticularly in Cook\'s Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby, law-\nstationer, pursues his lawful calling.  In the shade of Cook\'s \nCourt, at most times a shady place, Mr. Snagsby has dealt in all \nsorts of blank forms of legal process; in skins and rolls of \nparchment; in paper--foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white, whitey-\nbrown, and blotting; in stamps; in office-quills, pens, ink, India-\nrubber, pounce, pins, pencils, sealing-wax, and wafers; in red tape \nand green ferret; in pocket-books, almanacs, diaries, and law lists; \nin string boxes, rulers, inkstands--glass and leaden--pen-knives, \nscissors, bodkins, and other small office-cutlery; in short, in \narticles too numerous to mention, ever since he was out of his time \nand went into partnership with Peffer.  On that occasion, Cook\'s \nCourt was in a manner revolutionized by the new inscription in fresh \npaint, PEFFER AND SNAGSBY, displacing the time-honoured and not \neasily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only.  For smoke, which is the \nLondon ivy, had so wreathed itself round Peffer\'s name and clung to \nhis dwelling-place that the affectionate parasite quite overpowered \nthe parent tree.\n\nPeffer is never seen in Cook\'s Court now.  He is not expected there, \nfor he has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the \nchurchyard of St. Andrews, Holborn, with the waggons and hackney-\ncoaches roaring past him all the day and half the night like one \ngreat dragon.  If he ever steal forth when the dragon is at rest to \nair himself again in Cook\'s Court until admonished to return by the \ncrowing of the sanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in \nCursitor Street, whose ideas of daylight it would be curious to \nascertain, since he knows from his personal observation next to \nnothing about it--if Peffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of \nCook\'s Court, which no law-stationer in the trade can positively \ndeny, he comes invisibly, and no one is the worse or wiser.\n\nIn his lifetime, and likewise in the period of Snagsby\'s \"time\" of \nseven long years, there dwelt with Peffer in the same law-\nstationering premises a niece--a short, shrewd niece, something too \nviolently compressed about the waist, and with a sharp nose like a \nsharp autumn evening, inclining to be frosty towards the end.  The \nCook\'s Courtiers had a rumour flying among them that the mother of \nthis niece did, in her daughter\'s childhood, moved by too jealous a \nsolicitude that her figure should approach perfection, lace her up \nevery morning with her maternal foot against the bed-post for a \nstronger hold and purchase; and further, that she exhibited \ninternally pints of vinegar and lemon-juice, which acids, they held, \nhad mounted to the nose and temper of the patient.  With whichsoever \nof the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated, it \neither never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby, \nwho, having wooed and won its fair subject on his arrival at man\'s \nestate, entered into two partnerships at once.  So now, in Cook\'s \nCourt, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one; and the \nniece still cherishes her figure, which, however tastes may differ, \nis unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh, but, to \nthe neighbours\' thinking, one voice too.  That voice, appearing to \nproceed from Mrs. Snagsby alone, is heard in Cook\'s Court very \noften.  Mr. Snagsby, otherwise than as he finds expression through \nthese dulcet tones, is rarely heard.  He is a mild, bald, timid man \nwith a shining head and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out \nat the back.  He tends to meekness and obesity.  As he stands at his \ndoor in Cook\'s Court in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves, \nlooking up at the clouds, or stands behind a desk in his dark shop \nwith a heavy flat ruler, snipping and slicing at sheepskin in \ncompany with his two \'prentices, he is emphatically a retiring and \nunassuming man.  From beneath his feet, at such times, as from a \nshrill ghost unquiet in its grave, there frequently arise \ncomplainings and lamentations in the voice already mentioned; and \nhaply, on some occasions when these reach a sharper pitch than \nusual, Mr. Snagsby mentions to the \'prentices, \"I think my little \nwoman is a-giving it to Guster!\"\n\nThis proper name, so used by Mr. Snagsby, has before now sharpened \nthe wit of the Cook\'s Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the \nname of Mrs. Snagsby, seeing that she might with great force and \nexpression be termed a Guster, in compliment to her stormy \ncharacter.  It is, however, the possession, and the only possession \nexcept fifty shillings per annum and a very small box indifferently \nfilled with clothing, of a lean young woman from a workhouse (by \nsome supposed to have been christened Augusta) who, although she was \nfarmed or contracted for during her growing time by an amiable \nbenefactor of his species resident at Tooting, and cannot fail to \nhave been developed under the most favourable circumstances, \"has \nfits,\" which the parish can\'t account for.\n\nGuster, really aged three or four and twenty, but looking a round \nten years older, goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of \nfits, and is so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her \npatron saint that except when she is found with her head in the \npail, or the sink, or the copper, or the dinner, or anything else \nthat happens to be near her at the time of her seizure, she is \nalways at work.  She is a satisfaction to the parents and guardians \nof the \'prentices, who feel that there is little danger of her \ninspiring tender emotions in the breast of youth; she is a \nsatisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby, who can always find fault with her; \nshe is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby, who thinks it a charity to \nkeep her.  The law-stationer\'s establishment is, in Guster\'s eyes, a \ntemple of plenty and splendour.  She believes the little drawing-\nroom upstairs, always kept, as one may say, with its hair in papers \nand its pinafore on, to be the most elegant apartment in \nChristendom.  The view it commands of Cook\'s Court at one end (not \nto mention a squint into Cursitor Street) and of Coavinses\' the \nsheriff\'s officer\'s backyard at the other she regards as a prospect \nof unequalled beauty.  The portraits it displays in oil--and plenty \nof it too--of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs. \nSnagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her eyes as achievements of \nRaphael or Titian.  Guster has some recompenses for her many \nprivations.\n\nMr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the \nbusiness to Mrs. Snagsby.  She manages the money, reproaches the \ntax-gatherers, appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays, \nlicenses Mr. Snagsby\'s entertainments, and acknowledges no \nresponsibility as to what she thinks fit to provide for dinner, \ninsomuch that she is the high standard of comparison among the \nneighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides, and \neven out in Holborn, who in any domestic passages of arms habitually \ncall upon their husbands to look at the difference between their \n(the wives\') position and Mrs. Snagsby\'s, and their (the husbands\') \nbehaviour and Mr. Snagsby\'s.  Rumour, always flying bat-like about \nCook\'s Court and skimming in and out at everybody\'s windows, does \nsay that Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. \nSnagsby is sometimes worried out of house and home, and that if he \nhad the spirit of a mouse he wouldn\'t stand it.  It is even observed \nthat the wives who quote him to their self-willed husbands as a \nshining example in reality look down upon him and that nobody does \nso with greater superciliousness than one particular lady whose lord \nis more than suspected of laying his umbrella on her as an \ninstrument of correction.  But these vague whisperings may arise \nfrom Mr. Snagsby\'s being in his way rather a meditative and poetical \nman, loving to walk in Staple Inn in the summer-time and to observe \nhow countrified the sparrows and the leaves are, also to lounge \nabout the Rolls Yard of a Sunday afternoon and to remark (if in good \nspirits) that there were old times once and that you\'d find a stone \ncoffin or two now under that chapel, he\'ll be bound, if you was to \ndig for it.  He solaces his imagination, too, by thinking of the \nmany Chancellors and Vices, and Masters of the Rolls who are \ndeceased; and he gets such a flavour of the country out of telling \nthe two \'prentices how he HAS heard say that a brook \"as clear as \ncrystial\" once ran right down the middle of Holborn, when Turnstile \nreally was a turnstile, leading slap away into the meadows--gets \nsuch a flavour of the country out of this that he never wants to go \nthere.\n\nThe day is closing in and the gas is lighted, but is not yet fully \neffective, for it is not quite dark.  Mr. Snagsby standing at his \nshop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim \nwestward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook\'s Court.  The crow \nflies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln\'s Inn Garden into \nLincoln\'s Inn Fields.\n\nHere, in a large house, formerly a house of state, lives Mr. \nTulkinghorn.  It is let off in sets of chambers now, and in those \nshrunken fragments of its greatness, lawyers lie like maggots in \nnuts.  But its roomy staircases, passages, and antechambers still \nremain; and even its painted ceilings, where Allegory, in Roman \nhelmet and celestial linen, sprawls among balustrades and pillars, \nflowers, clouds, and big-legged boys, and makes the head ache--as \nwould seem to be Allegory\'s object always, more or less.  Here, \namong his many boxes labelled with transcendent names, lives Mr. \nTulkinghorn, when not speechlessly at home in country-houses where \nthe great ones of the earth are bored to death.  Here he is to-day, \nquiet at his table.  An oyster of the old school whom nobody can \nopen.\n\nLike as he is to look at, so is his apartment in the dusk of the \npresent afternoon.  Rusty, out of date, withdrawing from attention, \nable to afford it.  Heavy, broad-backed, old-fashioned, mahogany-\nand-horsehair chairs, not easily lifted; obsolete tables with \nspindle-legs and dusty baize covers; presentation prints of the \nholders of great titles in the last generation or the last but one, \nenviron him.  A thick and dingy Turkey-carpet muffles the floor \nwhere he sits, attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver \ncandlesticks that give a very insufficient light to his large room.  \nThe titles on the backs of his books have retired into the binding; \neverything that can have a lock has got one; no key is visible.  \nVery few loose papers are about.  He has some manuscript near him, \nbut is not referring to it.  With the round top of an inkstand and \ntwo broken bits of sealing-wax he is silently and slowly working out \nwhatever train of indecision is in his mind.  Now tbe inkstand top \nis in the middle, now the red bit of sealing-wax, now the black bit.  \nThat\'s not it.  Mr. Tulkinghorn must gather them all up and begin \nagain.\n\nHere, beneath the painted ceiling, with foreshortened Allegory \nstaring down at his intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him, and \nhe cutting it dead, Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and \noffice.  He keeps no staff, only one middle-aged man, usually a \nlittle out at elbows, who sits in a high pew in the hall and is \nrarely overburdened with business.  Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a \ncommon way.  He wants no clerks.  He is a great reservoir of \nconfidences, not to be so tapped.  His clients want HIM; he is all \nin all.  Drafts that he requires to be drawn are drawn by special-\npleaders in the temple on mysterious instructions; fair copies that \nhe requires to be made are made at the stationers\', expense being no \nconsideration.  The middle-aged man in the pew knows scarcely more \nof the affairs of the peerage than any crossing-sweeper in Holborn.\n\nThe red bit, the black bit, the inkstand top, the other inkstand \ntop, the little sand-box.  So!  You to the middle, you to the right, \nyou to the left.  This train of indecision must surely be worked out \nnow or never.  Now!  Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up, adjusts his \nspectacles, puts on his hat, puts the manuscript in his pocket, goes \nout, tells the middle-aged man out at elbows, \"I shall be back \npresently.\"  Very rarely tells him anything more explicit.\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn goes, as the crow came--not quite so straight, but \nnearly--to Cook\'s Court, Cursitor Street.  To Snagsby\'s, Law-\nStationer\'s, Deeds engrossed and copied, Law-Writing executed in all \nits branches, &c., &c., &c.\n\nIt is somewhere about five or six o\'clock in the afternoon, and a \nbalmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook\'s Court.  It hovers about \nSnagsby\'s door.  The hours are early there: dinner at half-past one \nand supper at half-past nine.  Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into \nthe subterranean regions to take tea when he looked out of his door \njust now and saw the crow who was out late.\n\n\"Master at home?\"\n\nGuster is minding the shop, for the \'prentices take tea in the \nkitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby; consequently, the robe-maker\'s \ntwo daughters, combing their curls at the two glasses in the two \nsecond-floor windows of the opposite house, are not driving the two \n\'prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose, but are merely \nawakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster, whose hair won\'t \ngrow, and never would, and it is confidently thought, never will.\n\n\"Master at home?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\nMaster is at home, and Guster will fetch him.  Guster disappears, \nglad to get out of the shop, which she regards with mingled dread \nand veneration as a storehouse of awful implements of the great \ntorture of the law--a place not to be entered after the gas is \nturned off.\n\nMr. Snagsby appears, greasy, warm, herbaceous, and chewing.  Bolts a \nbit of bread and butter.  Says, \"Bless my soul, sir!  Mr. \nTulkinghorn!\"\n\n\"I want half a word with you, Snagsby.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir!  Dear me, sir, why didn\'t you send your young man \nround for me?  Pray walk into the back shop, sir.\"  Snagsby has \nbrightened in a moment.\n\nThe confined room, strong of parchment-grease, is warehouse, \ncounting-house, and copying-office.  Mr. Tulkinghorn sits, facing \nround, on a stool at the desk.\n\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Snagsby.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"  Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind his \nhand, modestly anticipating profit.  Mr. Snagsby, as a timid man, is \naccustomed to cough with a variety of expressions, and so to save \nwords.\n\n\"You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, we did.\"\n\n\"There was one of them,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, carelessly feeling--\ntight, unopenable oyster of the old school!--in the wrong coat-\npocket, \"the handwriting of which is peculiar, and I rather like.  \nAs I happened to be passing, and thought I had it about me, I looked \nin to ask you--but I haven\'t got it.  No matter, any other time will \ndo.  Ah! here it is!  I looked in to ask you who copied this.\"\n\n\'\"Who copied this, sir?\" says Mr. Snagsby, taking it, laying it flat \non the desk, and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and \na twist of the left hand peculiar to lawstationers.  \"We gave this \nout, sir.  We were giving out rather a large quantity of work just \nat that time.  I can tell you in a moment who copied it, sir, by \nreferring to my book.\"\n\nMr. Snagsby takes his book down from the safe, makes another bolt of \nthe bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short, eyes \nthe affidavit aside, and brings his right forefinger travelling down \na page of the book, \"Jewby--Packer--Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"Jarndyce!  Here we are, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby.  \"To be sure!  I \nmight have remembered it.  This was given out, sir, to a writer who \nlodges just over on the opposite side of the lane.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry, found it before the law-\nstationer, read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill.\n\n\"WHAT do you call him?  Nemo?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.  \"Nemo, sir.  \nHere it is.  Forty-two folio.  Given out on the Wednesday night at \neight o\'clock, brought in on the Thursday morning at half after \nnine.\"\n\n\"Nemo!\" repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn.  \"Nemo is Latin for no one.\"\n\n\"It must be English for some one, sir, I think,\" Mr. Snagsby submits \nwith his deferential cough.  \"It is a person\'s name.  Here it is, \nyou see, sir!  Forty-two folio.  Given out Wednesday night, eight \no\'clock; brought in Thursday morning, half after nine.\"\n\nThe tail of Mr. Snagsby\'s eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs. \nSnagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by \ndeserting his tea.  Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to \nMrs. Snagsby, as who should say, \"My dear, a customer!\"\n\n\"Half after nine, sir,\" repeats Mr. Snagsby.  \"Our law-writers, who \nlive by job-work, are a queer lot; and this may not be his name, but \nit\'s the name he goes by.  I remember now, sir, that he gives it in \na written advertisement he sticks up down at the Rule Office, and \nthe King\'s Bench Office, and the Judges\' Chambers, and so forth.  \nYou know the kind of document, sir--wanting employ?\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of \nCoavinses\', the sheriff\'s officer\'s, where lights shine in \nCoavinses\' windows.  Coavinses\' coffee-room is at the back, and the \nshadows of several gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the \nblinds.  Mr. Snagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his \nhead to glance over his shoulder at his little woman and to make \napologetic motions with his mouth to this effect: \"Tul-king-horn--\nrich--in-flu-en-tial!\"\n\n\"Have you given this man work before?\" asks Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes, sir!  Work of yours.\"\n\n\"Thinking of more important matters, I forget where you said he \nlived?\"\n\n\"Across the lane, sir.  In fact, he lodges at a--\" Mr. Snagsby makes \nanother bolt, as if the bit of bread and buffer were insurmountable \n\"--at a rag and bottle shop.\"\n\n\"Can you show me the place as I go back?\"\n\n\"With the greatest pleasure, sir!\"\n\nMr. Snagsby pulls off his sleeves and his grey coat, pulls on his \nblack coat, takes his hat from its peg.  \"Oh! Here is my little \nwoman!\" he says aloud.  \"My dear, will you be so kind as to tell one \nof the lads to look after the shop while I step across the lane with \nMr. Tulkinghorn?  Mrs. Snagsby, sir--I shan\'t be two minutes, my \nlove!\"\n\nMrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer, retires behind the counter, peeps \nat them through the window-blind, goes softly into the back office, \nrefers to the entries in the book still lying open.  Is evidently \ncurious.\n\n\"You will find that the place is rough, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, \nwalking deferentially in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to \nthe lawyer; \"and the party is very rough.  But they\'re a wild lot in \ngeneral, sir.  The advantage of this particular man is that he never \nwants sleep.  He\'ll go at it right on end if you want him to, as \nlong as ever you like.\"\n\nIt is quite dark now, and the gas-lamps have acquired their full \neffect.  Jostling against clerks going to post the day\'s letters, \nand against counsel and attorneys going home to dinner, and against \nplaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts, and against the \ngeneral crowd, in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has \ninterposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the \ncommonest business of life; diving through law and equity, and \nthrough that kindred mystery, the street mud, which is made of \nnobody knows what and collects about us nobody knows whence or how--\nwe only knowing in general that when there is too much of it we find \nit necessary to shovel it away--the lawyer and the law-stationer \ncome to a rag and bottle shop and general emporium of much \ndisregarded merchandise, lying and being in the shadow of the wall \nof Lincoln\'s Inn, and kept, as is announced in paint, to all whom it \nmay concern, by one Krook.\n\n\"This is where he lives, sir,\" says the law-stationer.\n\n\"This is where he lives, is it?\" says the lawyer unconcernedly.  \n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Are you not going in, sir?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, no; I am going on to the Fields at present.  Good \nevening.  Thank you!\"  Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to his \nlittle woman and his tea.\n\nBut Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present.  He \ngoes a short way, turns back, comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook, \nand enters it straight.  It is dim enough, with a blot-headed candle \nor so in the windows, and an old man and a cat sitting in the back \npart by a fire.  The old man rises and comes forward, with another \nblot-headed candle in his hand.\n\n\"Pray is your lodger within?\"\n\n\"Male or female, sir?\" says Mr. Krook.\n\n\"Male.  The person who does copying.\"\n\nMr. Krook has eyed his man narrowly.  Knows him by sight.  Has an \nindistinct impression of his aristocratic repute.\n\n\"Did you wish to see him, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It\'s what I seldom do myself,\" says Mr. Krook with a grin.  \"Shall \nI call him down?  But it\'s a weak chance if he\'d come, sir!\"\n\n\"I\'ll go up to him, then,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\n\"Second floor, sir.  Take the candle.  Up there!\"  Mr. Krook, with \nhis cat beside him, stands at the bottom of the staircase, looking \nafter Mr. Tulkinghorn.  \"Hi-hi!\" he says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has \nnearly disappeared.  The lawyer looks down over the hand-rail.  The \ncat expands her wicked mouth and snarls at him.\n\n\"Order, Lady Jane!  Behave yourself to visitors, my lady!  You know \nwhat they say of my lodger?\" whispers Krook, going up a step or two.\n\n\"What do they say of him?\"\n\n\"They say he has sold himself to the enemy, but you and I know \nbetter--he don\'t buy.  I\'ll tell you what, though; my lodger is so \nblack-humoured and gloomy that I believe he\'d as soon make that \nbargain as any other.  Don\'t put him out, sir.  That\'s my advice!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his way.  He comes to the dark \ndoor on the second floor.  He knocks, receives no answer, opens it, \nand accidentally extinguishes his candle in doing so.\n\nThe air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished it if \nhe had not.  It is a small room, nearly black with soot, and grease, \nand dirt.  In the rusty skeleton of a grate, pinched at the middle \nas if poverty had gripped it, a red coke fire burns low.  In the \ncorner by the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk, a \nwilderness marked with a rain of ink.  In another corner a ragged \nold portmanteau on one of the two chairs serves for cabinet or \nwardrobe; no larger one is needed, for it collapses like the cheeks \nof a starved man.  The floor is bare, except that one old mat, \ntrodden to shreds of rope-yarn, lies perishing upon the hearth.  No \ncurtain veils the darkness of the night, but the discoloured \nshutters are drawn together, and through the two gaunt holes pierced \nin them, famine might be staring in--the banshee of the man upon the \nbed.\n\nFor, on a low bed opposite the fire, a confusion of dirty patchwork, \nlean-ribbed ticking, and coarse sacking, the lawyer, hesitating just \nwithin the doorway, sees a man.  He lies there, dressed in shirt and \ntrousers, with bare feet.  He has a yellow look in the spectral \ndarkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length \nof its wick (still burning) has doubled over and left a tower of \nwinding-sheet above it.  His hair is ragged, mingling with his \nwhiskers and his beard--the latter, ragged too, and grown, like the \nscum and mist around him, in neglect.  Foul and filthy as the room \nis, foul and filthy as the air is, it is not easy to perceive what \nfumes those are which most oppress the senses in it; but through the \ngeneral sickliness and faintness, and the odour of stale tobacco, \nthere comes into the lawyer\'s mouth the bitter, vapid taste of \nopium.\n\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries, and strikes his iron candlestick \nagainst the door.\n\nHe thinks he has awakened his friend.  He lies a little turned away, \nbut his eyes are surely open.\n\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries again.  \"Hallo!  Hallo!\"\n\nAs he rattles on the door, the candle which has drooped so long goes \nout and leaves him in the dark, with the gaunt eyes in the shutters \nstaring down upon the bed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nOur Dear Brother\n\n\nA touch on the lawyer\'s wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room, \nirresolute, makes him start and say, \"What\'s that?\"\n\n\"It\'s me,\" returns the old man of the house, whose breath is in his \near.  \"Can\'t you wake him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What have you done with your candle?\"\n\n\"It\'s gone out.  Here it is.\"\n\nKrook takes it, goes to the fire, stoops over the red embers, and \ntries to get a light.  The dying ashes have no light to spare, and \nhis endeavours are vain.  Muttering, after an ineffectual call to \nhis lodger, that he will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle \nfrom the shop, the old man departs.  Mr. Tulkinghorn, for some new \nreason that he has, does not await his return in the room, but on \nthe stairs outside.\n\nThe welcome light soon shines upon the wall, as Krook comes slowly \nup with his green-eyed cat following at his heels.  \"Does the man \ngenerally sleep like this?\" inquired the lawyer in a low voice.  \n\"Hi!  I don\'t know,\" says Krook, shaking his head and lifting his \neyebrows.  \"I know next to nothing of his habits except that he \nkeeps himself very close.\"\n\nThus whispering, they both go in together.  As the light goes in, \nthe great eyes in the shutters, darkening, seem to close.  Not so \nthe eyes upon the bed.\n\n\"God save us!\" exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn.  \"He is dead!\"  Krook drops \nthe heavy hand he has taken up so suddenly that the arm swings over \nthe bedside.\n\nThey look at one another for a moment.\n\n\"Send for some doctor!  Call for Miss Flite up the stairs, sir.  \nHere\'s poison by the bed!  Call out for Flite, will you?\" says \nKrook, with his lean hands spread out above the body like a \nvampire\'s wings.\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls, \"Miss Flite!  \nFlite!  Make haste, here, whoever you are!  Flite!\"  Krook follows \nhim with his eyes, and while he is calling, finds opportunity to \nsteal to the old portmanteau and steal back again.\n\n\"Run, Flite, run!  The nearest doctor!  Run!\"  So Mr. Krook \naddresses a crazy little woman who is his female lodger, who appears \nand vanishes in a breath, who soon returns accompanied by a testy \nmedical man brought from his dinner, with a broad, snuffy upper lip \nand a broad Scotch tongue.\n\n\"Ey!  Bless the hearts o\' ye,\" says the medical man, looking up at \nthem after a moment\'s examination.  \"He\'s just as dead as Phairy!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn (standing by the old portmanteau) inquires if he has \nbeen dead any time.\n\n\"Any time, sir?\" says the medical gentleman.  \"It\'s probable he wull \nhave been dead aboot three hours.\"\n\n\"About that time, I should say,\" observes a dark young man on the \nother side of the bed.\n\n\"Air you in the maydickle prayfession yourself, sir?\" inquires the \nfirst.\n\nThe dark young man says yes.\n\n\"Then I\'ll just tak\' my depairture,\" replies the other, \"for I\'m nae \ngude here!\"  With which remark he finishes his brief attendance and \nreturns to finish his dinner.\n\nThe dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face \nand carefully examines the law-writer, who has established his \npretensions to his name by becoming indeed No one.\n\n\"I knew this person by sight very well,\" says he.  \"He has purchased \nopium of me for the last year and a half.  Was anybody present \nrelated to him?\" glancing round upon the three bystanders.\n\n\"I was his landlord,\" grimly answers Krook, taking the candle from \nthe surgeon\'s outstretched hand.  \"He told me once I was the nearest \nrelation he had.\"\n\n\"He has died,\" says the surgeon, \"of an over-dose of opium, there is \nno doubt.  The room is strongly flavoured with it.  There is enough \nhere now,\" taking an old teapot from Mr. Krook, \"to kill a dozen \npeople.\"\n\n\"Do you think he did it on purpose?\" asks Krook.\n\n\"Took the over-dose?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"  Krook almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible \ninterest.\n\n\"I can\'t say.  I should think it unlikely, as he has been in the \nhabit of taking so much.  But nobody can tell.  He was very poor, I \nsuppose?\"\n\n\"I suppose he was.  His room--don\'t look rich,\" says Krook, who \nmight have changed eyes with his cat, as he casts his sharp glance \naround.  \"But I have never been in it since he had it, and he was \ntoo close to name his circumstances to me.\"\n\n\"Did he owe you any rent?\"\n\n\"Six weeks.\"\n\n\"He will never pay it!\" says the young man, resuming his \nexamination.  \"It is beyond a doubt that he is indeed as dead as \nPharaoh; and to judge from his appearance and condition, I should \nthink it a happy release.  Yet he must have been a good figure when \na youth, and I dare say, good-looking.\"  He says this, not \nunfeelingly, while sitting on the bedstead\'s edge with his face \ntowards that other face and his hand upon the region of the heart.  \n\"I recollect once thinking there was something in his manner, \nuncouth as it was, that denoted a fall in life.  Was that so?\" he \ncontinues, looking round.\n\nKrook replies, \"You might as well ask me to describe the ladies \nwhose heads of hair I have got in sacks downstairs.  Than that he \nwas my lodger for a year and a half and lived--or didn\'t live--by \nlaw-writing, I know no more of him.\"\n\nDuring this dialogue Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old \nportmanteau, with his hands behind him, equally removed, to all \nappearance, from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the \nbed--from the young surgeon\'s professional interest in death, \nnoticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as \nan individual; from the old man\'s unction; and the little crazy \nwoman\'s awe.  His imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as \nhis rusty clothes.  One could not even say he has been thinking all \nthis while.  He has shown neither patience nor impatience, nor \nattention nor abstraction.  He has shown nothing but his shell.  As \neasily might the tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred \nfrom its case, as the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his case.\n\nHe now interposes, addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved, \nprofessional way.\n\n\"I looked in here,\" he observes, \"just before you, with the \nintention of giving this deceased man, whom I never saw alive, some \nemployment at his trade of copying.  I had heard of him from my \nstationer--Snagsby of Cook\'s Court.  Since no one here knows \nanything about him, it might be as well to send for Snagsby.  Ah!\" \nto the little crazy woman, who has often seen him in court, and \nwhom he has often seen, and who proposes, in frightened dumb-show, \nto go for the law-stationer.  \"Suppose you do!\"\n\nWhile she is gone, the surgeon abandons his hopeless investigation \nand covers its subject with the patchwork counterpane.  Mr. Krook \nand he interchange a word or two.  Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing, \nbut stands, ever, near the old portmanteau.\n\nMr. Snagsby arrives hastily in his grey coat and his black sleeves.  \n\"Dear me, dear me,\" he says; \"and it has come to this, has it!  \nBless my soul!\"\n\n\"Can you give the person of the house any information about this \nunfortunate creature, Snagsby?\" inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn.  \"He was \nin arrears with his rent, it seems.  And he must be buried, you \nknow.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, coughing his apologetic cough behind \nhis hand, \"I really don\'t know what advice I could offer, except \nsending for the beadle.\"\n\n\"I don\'t speak of advice,\" returns Mr. Tulkinghorn.  \"I could \nadvise--\"\n\n\"No one better, sir, I am sure,\" says Mr. Snagsby, with his \ndeferential cough.\n\n\"I speak of affording some clue to his connexions, or to where he \ncame from, or to anything concerning him.\"\n\n\"I assure you, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby after prefacing his reply \nwith his cough of general propitiation, \"that I no more know where \nhe came from than I know--\"\n\n\"Where he has gone to, perhaps,\" suggests the surgeon to help him \nout.\n\nA pause.  Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law-stationer.  Mr. Krook, \nwith his mouth open, looking for somebody to speak next.\n\n\"As to his connexions, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, \"if a person was to \nsay to me, \"Snagsby, here\'s twenty thousand pound down, ready for \nyou in the Bank of England if you\'ll only name one of \'em,\' I \ncouldn\'t do it, sir!  About a year and a half ago--to the best of my \nbelief, at the time when he first came to lodge at the present rag \nand bottle shop--\"\n\n\"That was the time!\" says Krook with a nod.\n\n\"About a year and a half ago,\" says Mr. Snagsby, strengthened, \"he \ncame into our place one morning after breakfast, and finding my \nlittle woman (which I name Mrs. Snagsby when I use that appellation) \nin our shop, produced a specimen of his handwriting and gave her to \nunderstand that he was in want of copying work to do and was, not to \nput too fine a point upon it,\" a favourite apology for plain \nspeaking with Mr. Snagsby, which he always offers with a sort of \nargumentative frankness, \"hard up!  My little woman is not in \ngeneral partial to strangers, particular--not to put too fine a \npoint upon it--when they want anything.  But she was rather took by \nsomething about this person, whether by his being unshaved, or by \nhis hair being in want of attention, or by what other ladies\' \nreasons, I leave you to judge; and she accepted of the specimen, and \nlikewise of the address.  My little woman hasn\'t a good ear for \nnames,\" proceeds Mr. Snagsby after consulting his cough of \nconsideration behind his hand, \"and she considered Nemo equally the \nsame as Nimrod.  In consequence of which, she got into a habit of \nsaying to me at meals, \'Mr. Snagsby, you haven\'t found Nimrod any \nwork yet!\' or \'Mr. Snagsby, why didn\'t you give that eight and \nthirty Chancery folio in Jarndyce to Nimrod?\' or such like.  And \nthat is the way he gradually fell into job-work at our place; and \nthat is the most I know of him except that he was a quick hand, and \na hand not sparing of night-work, and that if you gave him out, say, \nfive and forty folio on the Wednesday night, you would have it \nbrought in on the Thursday morning.  All of which--\" Mr. Snagsby \nconcludes by politely motioning with his hat towards the bed, as \nmuch as to add, \"I have no doubt my honourable friend would confirm \nif he were in a condition to do it.\"\n\n\"Hadn\'t you better see,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook, \"whether he \nhad any papers that may enlighten you?  There will be an inquest, \nand you will be asked the question.  You can read?\"\n\n\"No, I can\'t,\" returns the old man with a sudden grin.\n\n\"Snagsby,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, \"look over the room for him.  He \nwill get into some trouble or difficulty otherwise.  Being here, \nI\'ll wait if you make haste, and then I can testify on his behalf, \nif it should ever be necessary, that all was fair and right.  If you \nwill hold the candle for Mr. Snagsby, my friend, he\'ll soon see \nwhether there is anything to help you.\"\n\n\"In the first place, here\'s an old portmanteau, sir,\" says Snagsby.\n\nAh, to be sure, so there is!  Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to \nhave seen it before, though he is standing so close to it, and \nthough there is very little else, heaven knows.\n\nThe marine-store merchant holds the light, and the law-stationer \nconducts the search.  The surgeon leans against the corner of the \nchimney-piece; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door.  \nThe apt old scholar of the old school, with his dull black breeches \ntied with ribbons at the knees, his large black waistcoat, his long-\nsleeved black coat, and his wisp of limp white neckerchief tied in \nthe bow the peerage knows so well, stands in exactly the same place \nand attitude.\n\nThere are some worthless articles of clothing in the old \nportmanteau; there is a bundle of pawnbrokers\' duplicates, those \nturnpike tickets on the road of poverty; there is a crumpled paper, \nsmelling of opium, on which are scrawled rough memoranda--as, took, \nsuch a day, so many grains; took, such another day, so many more--\nbegun some time ago, as if with the intention of being regularly \ncontinued, but soon left off.  There are a few dirty scraps of \nnewspapers, all referring to coroners\' inquests; there is nothing \nelse.  They search the cupboard and the drawer of the ink-splashed \ntable.  There is not a morsel of an old letter or of any other \nwriting in either.  The young surgeon examines the dress on the law-\nwriter.  A knife and some odd halfpence are all he finds.  Mr. \nSnagsby\'s suggestion is the practical suggestion after all, and the \nbeadle must be called in.\n\nSo the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle, and the rest come \nout of the room.  \"Don\'t leave the cat there!\" says the surgeon; \n\"that won\'t do!\"  Mr. Krook therefore drives her out before him, and \nshe goes furtively downstairs, winding her lithe tail and licking \nher lips.\n\n\"Good night!\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, and goes home to Allegory and \nmeditation.\n\nBy this time the news has got into the court.  Groups of its \ninhabitants assemble to discuss the thing, and the outposts of the \narmy of observation (principally boys) are pushed forward to Mr. \nKrook\'s window, which they closely invest.  A policeman has already \nwalked up to the room, and walked down again to the door, where he \nstands like a tower, only condescending to see the boys at his base \noccasionally; but whenever he does see them, they quail and fall \nback.  Mrs. Perkins, who has not been for some weeks on speaking \nterms with Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness \noriginating in young Perkins\' having \"fetched\" young Piper \"a \ncrack,\" renews her friendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion.  \nThe potboy at the corner, who is a privileged amateur, as possessing \nofficial knowledge of life and having to deal with drunken men \noccasionally, exchanges confidential communications with the \npoliceman and has the appearance of an impregnable youth, \nunassailable by truncheons and unconfinable in station-houses.  \nPeople talk across the court out of window, and bare-headed scouts \ncome hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what\'s the matter.  The \ngeneral feeling seems to be that it\'s a blessing Mr. Krook warn\'t \nmade away with first, mingled with a little natural disappointment \nthat he was not.  In the midst of this sensation, the beadle \narrives.\n\nThe beadle, though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a \nridiculous institution, is not without a certain popularity for the \nmoment, if it were only as a man who is going to see the body.  The \npoliceman considers him an imbecile civilian, a remnant of the \nbarbarous watchmen times, but gives him admission as something that \nmust be borne with until government shall abolish him.  The \nsensation is heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth \nthat the beadle is on the ground and has gone in.\n\nBy and by the beadle comes out, once more intensifying the \nsensation, which has rather languished in the interval.  He is \nunderstood to be in want of witnesses for the inquest to-morrow who \ncan tell the coroner and jury anything whatever respecting the \ndeceased.  Is immediately referred to innumerable people who can \ntell nothing whatever.  Is made more imbecile by being constantly \ninformed that Mrs. Green\'s son \"was a law-writer his-self and knowed \nhim better than anybody,\" which son of Mrs. Green\'s appears, on \ninquiry, to be at the present time aboard a vessel bound for China, \nthree months out, but considered accessible by telegraph on \napplication to the Lords of the Admiralty.  Beadle goes into various \nshops and parlours, examining the inhabitants, always shutting the \ndoor first, and by exclusion, delay, and general idiotcy \nexasperating the public.  Policeman seen to smile to potboy.  Public \nloses interest and undergoes reaction.  Taunts the beadle in shrill \nyouthful voices with having boiled a boy, choruses fragments of a \npopular song to that effect and importing that the boy was made into \nsoup for the workhouse.  Policeman at last finds it necessary to \nsupport the law and seize a vocalist, who is released upon the \nflight of the rest on condition of his getting out of this then, \ncome, and cutting it--a condition he immediately observes.  So the \nsensation dies off for the time; and the unmoved policeman (to whom \na little opium, more or less, is nothing), with his shining hat, \nstiff stock, inflexible great-coat, stout belt and bracelet, and all \nthings fitting, pursues his lounging way with a heavy tread, beating \nthe palms of his white gloves one against the other and stopping now \nand then at a street-corner to look casually about for anything \nbetween a lost child and a murder.\n\nUnder cover of the night, the feeble-minded beadle comes flitting \nabout Chancery Lane with his summonses, in which every juror\'s name \nis wrongly spelt, and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle\'s own \nname, which nobody can read or wants to know.  The summonses served \nand his witnesses forewarned, the beadle goes to Mr. Krook\'s to keep \na small appointment he has made with certain paupers, who, presently \narriving, are conducted upstairs, where they leave the great eyes in \nthe shutter something new to stare at, in that last shape which \nearthly lodgings take for No one--and for Every one.\n\nAnd all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau; \nand the lonely figure on the bed, whose path in life has lain \nthrough five and forty years, lies there with no more track behind \nhim that any one can trace than a deserted infant.\n\nNext day the court is all alive--is like a fair, as Mrs. Perkins, \nmore than reconciled to Mrs. Piper, says in amicable conversation \nwith that excellent woman.  The coroner is to sit in the first-floor \nroom at the Sol\'s Arms, where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice \na week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional \ncelebrity, faced by Little Swills, the comic vocalist, who hopes \n(according to the bill in the window) that his friends will rally \nround him and support first-rate talent.  The Sol\'s Arms does a \nbrisk stroke of business all the morning.  Even children so require \nsustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has \nestablished himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says \nhis brandy-balls go off like smoke.  What time the beadle, hovering \nbetween the door of Mr. Krook\'s establishment and the door of the \nSol\'s Arms, shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet \nspirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in \nreturn.\n\nAt the appointed hour arrives the coroner, for whom the jurymen are \nwaiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good \ndry skittle-ground attached to the Sol\'s Arms.  The coroner \nfrequents more public-houses than any man alive.  The smell of \nsawdust, beer, tobacco-smoke, and spirits is inseparable in his \nvocation from death in its most awful shapes.  He is conducted by \nthe beadle and the landlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room, where he \nputs his hat on the piano and takes a Windsor-chair at the head of a \nlong table formed of several short tables put together and \nornamented with glutinous rings in endless involutions, made by pots \nand glasses.  As many of the jury as can crowd together at the table \nsit there.  The rest get among the spittoons and pipes or lean \nagainst the piano.  Over the coroner\'s head is a small iron garland, \nthe pendant handle of a bell, which rather gives the majesty of the \ncourt the appearance of going to be hanged presently.\n\nCall over and swear the jury!  While the ceremony is in progress, \nsensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a \nlarge shirt-collar, with a moist eye and an inflamed nose, who \nmodestly takes a position near the door as one of the general \npublic, but seems familiar with the room too.  A whisper circulates \nthat this is Little Swills.  It is considered not unlikely that he \nwill get up an imitation of the coroner and make it the principal \nfeature of the Harmonic Meeting in the evenlng.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen--\" the coroner begins.\n\n\"Silence there, will you!\" says the beadle.  Not to the coroner, \nthough it might appear so.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" resumes the coroner.  \"You are impanelled here to \ninquire into the death of a certain man.  Evidence will be given \nbefore you as to the circumstances attending that death, and you \nwill give your verdict according to the--skittles; they must be \nstopped, you know, beadle!--evidence, and not according to anything \nelse.  The first thing to be done is to view the body.\"\n\n\"Make way there!\" cries the beadle.\n\nSo they go out in a loose procession, something after the manner of \na straggling funeral, and make their inspection in Mr. Krook\'s back \nsecond floor, from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and \nprecipitately.  The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not \nvery neat about the cuffs and buttons (for whose accommodation he \nhas provided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic \nMeeting Room) should see all that is to be seen.  For they are the \npublic chroniclers of such inquiries by the line; and he is not \nsuperior to the universal human infirmity, but hopes to read in \nprint what \"Mooney, the active and intelligent beadle of the \ndistrict,\" said and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney \nas familiarly and patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman \nis, according to the latest examples.\n\nLittle Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return.  \nMr. Tulkinghorn, also.  Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction \nand seated near the coroner between that high judicial officer, a \nbagatelle-board, and the coal-box.  The inquiry proceeds.  The jury \nlearn how the subject of their inquiry died, and learn no more about \nhim.  \"A very eminent solicitor is in attendance, gentlemen,\" says \nthe coroner, \"who, I am informed, was accidentally present when \ndiscovery of the death was made, but he could only repeat the \nevidence you have already heard from the surgeon, the landlord, the \nlodger, and the law-stationer, and it is not necessary to trouble \nhim.  Is anybody in attendance who knows anything more?\"\n\nMrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins.  Mrs. Piper sworn.\n\nAnastasia Piper, gentlemen.  Married woman.  Now, Mrs. Piper, what \nhave you got to say about this?\n\nWhy, Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say, chiefly in parentheses and \nwithout punctuation, but not much to tell.  Mrs. Piper lives in the \ncourt (which her husband is a cabinet-maker), and it has long been \nwell beknown among the neighbours (counting from the day next but \none before the half-baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen \nmonths and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live \nsuch was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his gums) as the \nplaintive--so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased--was \nreported to have sold himself.  Thinks it was the plaintive\'s air in \nwhich that report originatinin.  See the plaintive often and \nconsidered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go \nabout some children being timid (and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins \nmay be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her \nhusband and herself and family).  Has seen the plaintive wexed and \nworrited by the children (for children they will ever be and you \ncannot expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be \nMethoozellers which you was not yourself).  On accounts of this and \nhis dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pick-axe from \nhis pocket and split Johnny\'s head (which the child knows not fear \nand has repeatually called after him close at his eels).  Never \nhowever see the plaintive take a pick-axe or any other wepping far \nfrom it.  Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if \nnot partial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor \ngrown person at any time (excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing \ndown the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here \nwould tell you that he has been seen a-speaking to him frequent).\n\nSays the coroner, is that boy here?  Says the beadle, no, sir, he is \nnot here.  Says the coroner, go and fetch him then.  In the absence \nof the active and intelligent, the coroner converses with Mr. \nTulkinghorn.\n\nOh! Here\'s the boy, gentlemen!\n\nHere he is, very muddy, very hoarse, very ragged.  Now, boy!  But \nstop a minute.  Caution.  This boy must be put through a few \npreliminary paces.\n\nName, Jo.  Nothing else that he knows on.  Don\'t know that everybody \nhas two names.  Never heerd of sich a think.  Don\'t know that Jo is \nshort for a longer name.  Thinks it long enough for HIM.  HE don\'t \nfind no fault with it.  Spell it?  No.  HE can\'t spell it.  No \nfather, no mother, no friends.  Never been to school.  What\'s home?  \nKnows a broom\'s a broom, and knows it\'s wicked to tell a lie.  Don\'t \nrecollect who told him about the broom or about the lie, but knows \nboth.  Can\'t exactly say what\'ll be done to him arter he\'s dead if \nhe tells a lie to the gentlemen here, but believes it\'ll be \nsomething wery bad to punish him, and serve him right--and so he\'ll \ntell the truth.\n\n\"This won\'t do, gentlemen!\" says the coroner with a melancholy shake \nof the head.\n\n\"Don\'t you think you can receive his evidence, sir?\" asks an \nattentive juryman.\n\n\"Out of the question,\" says the coroner.  \"You have heard the boy.  \n\'Can\'t exactly say\' won\'t do, you know.  We can\'t take THAT in a \ncourt of justice, gentlemen.  It\'s terrible depravity.  Put the boy \naside.\"\n\nBoy put aside, to the great edification of the audience, especially \nof Little Swills, the comic vocalist.\n\nNow.  Is there any other witness?  No other witness.\n\nVery well, gentlemen!  Here\'s a man unknown, proved to have been in \nthe habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half, \nfound dead of too much opium.  If you think you have any evidence to \nlead you to the conclusion that he committed suicide, you will come \nto that conclusion.  If you think it is a case of accidental death, \nyou will find a verdict accordingly.\n\nVerdict accordingly.  Accidental death.  No doubt.  Gentlemen, you \nare discharged.  Good afternoon.\n\nWhile the coroner buttons his great-coat, Mr. Tulkinghorn and he \ngive private audience to the rejected witness in a corner.\n\nThat graceless creature only knows that the dead man (whom he \nrecognized just now by his yellow face and black hair) was sometimes \nhooted and pursued about the streets.  That one cold winter night \nwhen he, the boy, was shivering in a doorway near his crossing, the \nman turned to look at him, and came back, and having questioned him \nand found that he had not a friend in the world, said, \"Neither have \nI.  Not one!\" and gave him the price of a supper and a night\'s \nlodging.  That the man had often spoken to him since and asked him \nwhether he slept sound at night, and how he bore cold and hunger, \nand whether he ever wished to die, and similar strange questions.  \nThat when the man had no money, he would say in passing, \"I am as \npoor as you to-day, Jo,\" but that when he had any, he had always (as \nthe boy most heartily believes) been glad to give him some.\n\n\"He was wery good to me,\" says the boy, wiping his eyes with his \nwretched sleeve.  \"Wen I see him a-layin\' so stritched out just now, \nI wished he could have heerd me tell him so.  He wos wery good to \nme, he wos!\"\n\nAs he shuffles downstairs, Mr. Snagsby, lying in wait for him, puts \na half-crown in his hand.  \"If you ever see me coming past your \ncrossing with my little woman--I mean a lady--\" says Mr. Snagsby \nwith his finger on his nose, \"don\'t allude to it!\"\n\nFor some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol\'s Arms \ncolloquially.  In the sequel, half-a-dozen are caught up in a cloud \nof pipe-smoke that pervades the parlour of the Sol\'s Arms; two \nstroll to Hampstead; and four engage to go half-price to the play at \nnight, and top up with oysters.  Little Swills is treated on several \nhands.  Being asked what he thinks of the proceedings, characterizes \nthem (his strength lying in a slangular direction) as \"a rummy \nstart.\"  The landlord of the Sol\'s Arms, finding Little Swills so \npopular, commends him highly to the jurymen and public, observing \nthat for a song in character he don\'t know his equal and that that \nman\'s character-wardrobe would fill a cart.\n\nThus, gradually the Sol\'s Arms melts into the shadowy night and then \nflares out of it strong in gas.  The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving, \nthe gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair, is faced \n(red-faced) by Little Swills; their friends rally round them and \nsupport first-rate talent.  In the zenith of the evening, Little \nSwills says, \"Gentlemen, if you\'ll permit me, I\'ll attempt a short \ndescription of a scene of real life that came off here to-day.\"  Is \nmuch applauded and encouraged; goes out of the room as Swills; comes \nin as the coroner (not the least in the world like him); describes \nthe inquest, with recreative intervals of piano-forte accompaniment, \nto the refrain: With his (the coroner\'s) tippy tol li doll, tippy \ntol lo doll, tippy tol li doll, Dee!\n\nThe jingling piano at last is silent, and the Harmonic friends rally \nround their pillows.  Then there is rest around the lonely figure, \nnow laid in its last earthly habitation; and it is watched by the \ngaunt eyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night.  If \nthis forlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here by \nthe mother at whose breast he nestled, a little child, with eyes \nupraised to her loving face, and soft hand scarcely knowing how to \nclose upon the neck to which it crept, what an impossibility the \nvision would have seemed!  Oh, if in brighter days the now-\nextinguished fire within him ever burned for one woman who held him \nin her heart, where is she, while these ashes are above the ground!\n\nIt is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby\'s, in Cook\'s \nCourt, where Guster murders sleep by going, as Mr. Snagsby himself \nallows--not to put too fine a point upon it--out of one fit into \ntwenty.  The occasion of this seizure is that Guster has a tender \nheart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been \nimagination, but for Tooting and her patron saint.  Be it what it \nmay, now, it was so direfully impressed at tea-time by Mr. Snagsby\'s \naccount of the inquiry at which he had assisted that at supper-time \nshe projected herself into the kitchen, preceded by a flying Dutch \ncheese, and fell into a fit of unusual duration, which she only came \nout of to go into another, and another, and so on through a chain of \nfits, with short intervals between, of which she has pathetically \navailed herself by consuming them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not \nto give her warning \"when she quite comes to,\" and also in appeals \nto the whole establishment to lay her down on the stones and go to \nbed.  Hence, Mr. Snagsby, at last hearing the cock at the little \ndairy in Cursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his \non the subject of daylight, says, drawing a long breath, though the \nmost patient of men, \"I thought you was dead, I am sure!\"\n\nWhat question this enthusiastic fowl supposes he settles when he \nstrains himself to such an extent, or why he should thus crow (so \nmen crow on various triumphant public occasions, however) about what \ncannot be of any moment to him, is his affair.  It is enough that \ndaylight comes, morning comes, noon comes.\n\nThen the active and intelligent, who has got into the morning papers \nas such, comes with his pauper company to Mr. Krook\'s and bears off \nthe body of our dear brother here departed to a hemmed-in \nchurchyard, pestiferous and obscene, whence malignant diseases are \ncommunicated to the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have \nnot departed, while our dear brothers and sisters who hang about \nofficial back-stairs--would to heaven they HAD departed!--are very \ncomplacent and agreeable.  Into a beastly scrap of ground which a \nTurk would reject as a savage abomination and a Caffre would shudder \nat, they bring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian \nburial.\n\nWith houses looking on, on every side, save where a reeking little \ntunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate--with every villainy \nof life in action close on death, and every poisonous element of \ndeath in action close on life--here they lower our dear brother down \na foot or two, here sow him in corruption, to be raised in \ncorruption: an avenging ghost at many a sick-bedside, a shameful \ntestimony to future ages how civilization and barbarism walked this \nboastful island together.\n\nCome night, come darkness, for you cannot come too soon or stay too \nlong by such a place as this!  Come, straggling lights into the \nwindows of the ugly houses; and you who do iniquity therein, do it \nat least with this dread scene shut out!  Come, flame of gas, \nburning so sullenly above the iron gate, on which the poisoned air \ndeposits its witch-ointment slimy to the touch!  It is well that you \nshould call to every passerby, \"Look here!\"\n\nWith the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to \nthe outside of the iron gate.  It holds the gate with its hands and \nlooks in between the bars, stands looking in for a little while.\n\nIt then, with an old broom it carries, softly sweeps the step and \nmakes the archway clean.  It does so very busily and trimly, looks \nin again a little while, and so departs.\n\nJo, is it thou?  Well, well!  Though a rejected witness, who \"can\'t \nexactly say\" what will be done to him in greater hands than men\'s, \nthou art not quite in outer darkness.  There is something like a \ndistant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this: \"He wos wery \ngood to me, he wos!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nOn the Watch\n\n\nIt has left off raining down in Lincolnshire at last, and Chesney \nWold has taken heart.  Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares, \nfor Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris.  The \nfashionable intelligence has found it out and communicates the glad \ntidings to benighted England.  It has also found out that they will \nentertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the ELITE of the \nBEAU MONDE (the fashionable intelligence is weak in English, but a \ngiant refreshed in French) at the ancient and hospitable family seat \nin Lincolnshire.\n\nFor the greater honour of the brilliant and distinguished circle, \nand of Chesney Wold into the bargain, the broken arch of the bridge \nin the park is mended; and the water, now retired within its proper \nlimits and again spanned gracefully, makes a figure in the prospect \nfrom the house.  The clear, cold sunshine glances into the brittle \nwoods and approvingly beholds the sharp wind scattering the leaves \nand drying the moss.  It glides over the park after the moving \nshadows of the clouds, and chases them, and never catches them, all \nday.  It looks in at the windows and touches the ancestral portraits \nwith bars and patches of brightness never contemplated by the \npainters.  Athwart the picture of my Lady, over the great chimney-\npiece, it throws a broad bend-sinister of light that strikes down \ncrookedly into the hearth and seems to rend it.\n\nThrough the same cold sunshine and the same sharp wind, my Lady and \nSir Leicester, in their travelling chariot (my Lady\'s woman and Sir \nLeicester\'s man affectionate in the rumble), start for home.  With a \nconsiderable amount of jingling and whip-cracking, and many plunging \ndemonstrations on the part of two bare-backed horses and two \ncentaurs with glazed hats, jack-boots, and flowing manes and tails, \nthey rattle out of the yard of the Hotel Bristol in the Place \nVendome and canter between the sun-and-shadow-chequered colonnade of \nthe Rue de Rivoli and the garden of the ill-fated palace of a \nheadless king and queen, off by the Place of Concord, and the \nElysian Fields, and the Gate of the Star, out of Paris.\n\nSooth to say, they cannot go away too fast, for even here my Lady \nDedlock has been bored to death.  Concert, assembly, opera, theatre, \ndrive, nothing is new to my Lady under the worn-out heavens.  Only \nlast Sunday, when poor wretches were gay--within the walls playing \nwith children among the clipped trees and the statues in the Palace \nGarden; walking, a score abreast, in the Elysian Fields, made more \nElysian by performing dogs and wooden horses; between whiles \nfiltering (a few) through the gloomy Cathedral of Our Lady to say a \nword or two at the base of a pillar within flare of a rusty little \ngridiron-full of gusty little tapers; without the walls encompassing \nParis with dancing, love-making, wine-drinking, tobacco-smoking, \ntomb-visiting, billiard card and domino playing, quack-doctoring, \nand much murderous refuse, animate and inanimate--only last Sunday, \nmy Lady, in the desolation of Boredom and the clutch of Giant \nDespair, almost hated her own maid for being in spirits.\n\nShe cannot, therefore, go too fast from Paris.  Weariness of soul \nlies before her, as it lies behind--her Ariel has put a girdle of it \nround the whole earth, and it cannot be unclasped--but the imperfect \nremedy is always to fly from the last place where it has been \nexperienced.  Fling Paris back into the distance, then, exchanging \nit for endless avenues and cross-avenues of wintry trees!  And, when \nnext beheld, let it be some leagues away, with the Gate of the Star \na white speck glittering in the sun, and the city a mere mound in a \nplain--two dark square towers rising out of it, and light and shadow \ndescending on it aslant, like the angels in Jacob\'s dream!\n\nSir Leicester is generally in a complacent state, and rarely bored.  \nWhen he has nothing else to do, he can always contemplate his own \ngreatness.  It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so \ninexhaustible a subject.  After reading his letters, he leans back \nin his corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance \nto society.\n\n\"You have an unusual amount of correspondence this morning?\" says my \nLady after a long time.  She is fatigued with reading.  Has almost \nread a page in twenty miles.\n\n\"Nothing in it, though.  Nothing whatever.\"\n\n\"I saw one of Mr. Tulkinghorn\'s long effusions, I think?\"\n\n\"You see everything,\" says Sir Leicester with admiration.\n\n\"Ha!\" sighs my Lady.  \"He is the most tiresome of men!\"\n\n\"He sends--I really beg your pardon--he sends,\" says Sir Leicester, \nselecting the letter and unfolding it, \"a message to you.  Our \nstopping to change horses as I came to his postscript drove it out \nof my memory.  I beg you\'ll excuse me.  He says--\"  Sir Leicester is \nso long in taking out his eye-glass and adjusting it that my Lady \nlooks a little irritated.  \"He says \'In the matter of the right of \nway--\'  I beg your pardon, that\'s not the place.  He says--yes!  \nHere I have it!  He says, \'I beg my respectful compliments to my \nLady, who, I hope, has benefited by the change.  Will you do me the \nfavour to mention (as it may interest her) that I have something to \ntell her on her return in reference to the person who copied the \naffidavit in the Chancery suit, which so powerfully stimulated her \ncuriosity.  I have seen him.\'\"\n\nMy Lady, leaning forward, looks out of her window.\n\n\"That\'s the message,\" observes Sir Leicester.\n\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady, still looking out of \nher window.\n\n\"Walk?\" repeats Sir Leicester in a tone of surprise.\n\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady with unmistakable \ndistinctness.  \"Please to stop the carriage.\"\n\nThe carriage is stopped, the affectionate man alights from the \nrumble, opens the door, and lets down the steps, obedient to an \nimpatient motion of my Lady\'s hand.  My Lady alights so quickly and \nwalks away so quickly that Sir Leicester, for all his scrupulous \npoliteness, is unable to assist her, and is left behind.  A space of \na minute or two has elapsed before he comes up with her.  She \nsmiles, looks very handsome, takes his arm, lounges with him for a \nquarter of a mile, is very much bored, and resumes her seat in the \ncarriage.\n\nThe rattle and clatter continue through the greater part of three \ndays, with more or less of bell-jingling and whip-cracking, and more \nor less plunging of centaurs and bare-backed horses.  Their courtly \npoliteness to each other at the hotels where they tarry is the theme \nof general admiration.  Though my Lord IS a little aged for my Lady, \nsays Madame, the hostess of the Golden Ape, and though he might be \nher amiable father, one can see at a glance that they love each \nother.  One observes my Lord with his white hair, standing, hat in \nhand, to help my Lady to and from the carriage.  One observes my \nLady, how recognisant of my Lord\'s politeness, with an inclination \nof her gracious head and the concession of her so-genteel fingers!  \nIt is ravishing!\n\nThe sea has no appreciation of great men, but knocks them about like \nthe small fry.  It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester, whose \ncountenance it greenly mottles in the manner of sage-cheese and in \nwhose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution.  It is the \nRadical of Nature to him.  Nevertheless, his dignity gets over it \nafter stopping to refit, and he goes on with my Lady for Chesney \nWold, lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire.\n\nThrough the same cold sunlight, colder as the day declines, and \nthrough the same sharp wind, sharper as the separate shadows of bare \ntrees gloom together in the woods, and as the Ghost\'s Walk, touched \nat the western corner by a pile of fire in the sky, resigns itself \nto coming night, they drive into the park.  The rooks, swinging in \ntheir lofty houses in the elm-tree avenue, seem to discuss the \nquestion of the occupancy of the carriage as it passes underneath, \nsome agreeing that Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down, some \narguing with malcontents who won\'t admit it, now all consenting to \nconsider the question disposed of, now all breaking out again in \nviolent debate, incited by one obstinate and drowsy bird who will \npersist in putting in a last contradictory croak.  Leaving them to \nswing and caw, the travelling chariot rolls on to the house, where \nfires gleam warmly through some of the windows, though not through \nso many as to give an inhabited expression to the darkening mass of \nfront.  But the brilliant and distinguished circle will soon do \nthat.\n\nMrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester\'s \ncustomary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy.\n\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Rouncewell?  I am glad to see you.\"\n\n\"I hope I have the honour of welcoming you in good health, Sir \nLeicester?\"\n\n\"In excellent health, Mrs. Rouncewell.\"\n\n\"My Lady is looking charmingly well,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell with \nanother curtsy.\n\nMy Lady signifies, without profuse expenditure of words, that she is \nas wearily well as she can hope to be.\n\nBut Rosa is in the distance, behind the housekeeper; and my Lady, \nwho has not subdued the quickness of her observation, whatever else \nshe may have conquered, asks, \"Who is that girl?\"\n\n\"A young scholar of mine, my Lady.  Rosa.\"\n\n\"Come here, Rosa!\"  Lady Dedlock beckons her, with even an \nappearance of interest.  \"Why, do you know how pretty you are, \nchild?\" she says, touching her shoulder with her two forefingers.\n\nRosa, very much abashed, says, \"No, if you please, my Lady!\" and \nglances up, and glances down, and don\'t know where to look, but \nlooks all the prettier.\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"Nineteen, my Lady.\"\n\n\"Nineteen,\" repeats my Lady thoughtfully.  \"Take care they don\'t \nspoil you by flattery.\"\n\n\"Yes, my Lady.\"\n\nMy Lady taps her dimpled cheek with the same delicate gloved fingers \nand goes on to the foot of the oak staircase, where Sir Leicester \npauses for her as her knightly escort.  A staring old Dedlock in a \npanel, as large as life and as dull, looks as if he didn\'t know what \nto make of it, which was probably his general state of mind in the \ndays of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThat evening, in the housekeeper\'s room, Rosa can do nothing but \nmurmur Lady Dedlock\'s praises.  She is so affable, so graceful, so \nbeautiful, so elegant; has such a sweet voice and such a thrilling \ntouch that Rosa can feel it yet!  Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this, \nnot without personal pride, reserving only the one point of \naffability.  Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that.  Heaven \nforbid that she should say a syllable in dispraise of any member of \nthat excellent family, above all, of my Lady, whom the whole world \nadmires; but if my Lady would only be \"a little more free,\" not \nquite so cold and distant, Mrs. Rounceweil thinks she would be more \naffable.\n\n\"\'Tis almost a pity,\" Mrs. Rouncewell adds--only \"almost\" because it \nborders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it \nis, in such an express dispensation as the Dedlock affairs--\"that my \nLady has no family.  If she had had a daughter now, a grown young \nlady, to interest her, I think she would have had the only kind of \nexcellence she wants.\"\n\n\"Might not that have made her still more proud, grandmother?\" says \nWatt, who has been home and come back again, he is such a good \ngrandson.\n\n\"More and most, my dear,\" returns the housekeeper with dignity, \"are \nwords it\'s not my place to use--nor so much as to hear--applied to \nany drawback on my Lady.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, grandmother.  But she is proud, is she not?\"\n\n\"If she is, she has reason to be.  The Dedlock family have always \nreason to be.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says Watt, \"it\'s to be hoped they line out of their prayer-\nbooks a certain passage for the common people about pride and \nvainglory.  Forgive me, grandmother!  Only a joke!\"\n\n\"Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, my dear, are not fit subjects for \njoking.\"\n\n\"Sir Leicester is no joke by any means,\" says Watt, \"and I humbly \nask his pardon.  I suppose, grandmother, that even with the family \nand their guests down here, there is no ojection to my prolonging my \nstay at the Dedlock Arms for a day or two, as any other traveller \nmight?\"\n\n\"Surely, none in the world, child.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that,\" says Watt, \"because I have an inexpressible \ndesire to extend my knowledge of this beautiful neighbourhood.\"\n\nHe happens to glance at Rosa, who looks down and is very shy indeed.  \nBut according to the old superstition, it should be Rosa\'s ears that \nburn, and not her fresh bright cheeks, for my Lady\'s maid is holding \nforth about her at this moment with surpassing energy.\n\nMy Lady\'s maid is a Frenchwoman of two and thirty, from somewhere in \nthe southern country about Avignon and Marseilles, a large-eyed \nbrown woman with black hair who would be handsome but for a certain \nfeline mouth and general uncomfortable tightness of face, rendering \nthe jaws too eager and the skull too prominent.  There is something \nindefinably keen and wan about her anatomy, and she has a watchful \nway of looking out of the corners of her eyes without turning her \nhead which could be pleasantly dispensed with, especially when she \nis in an ill humour and near knives.  Through all the good taste of \nher dress and little adornments, these objections so express \nthemselves that she seems to go about like a very neat she-wolf \nimperfectly tamed.  Besides being accomplished in all the knowledge \nappertaining to her post, she is almost an Englishwoman in her \nacquaintance with the language; consequently, she is in no want of \nwords to shower upon Rosa for having attracted my Lady\'s attention, \nand she pours them out with such grim ridicule as she sits at dinner \nthat her companion, the affectionate man, is rather relieved when \nshe arrives at the spoon stage of that performance.\n\nHa, ha, ha!  She, Hortense, been in my Lady\'s service since five \nyears and always kept at the distance, and this doll, this puppet, \ncaressed--absolutely caressed--by my Lady on the moment of her \narriving at the house!  Ha, ha, ha!  \"And do you know how pretty you \nare, child?\"  \"No, my Lady.\"  You are right there!  \"And how old are \nyou, child!  And take care they do not spoil you by flattery, \nchild!\"  Oh, how droll!  It is the BEST thing altogether.\n\nIn short, it is such an admirable thing that Mademoiselle Hortense \ncan\'t forget it; but at meals for days afterwards, even among her \ncountrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of \nvisitors, relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke--an enjoyment \nexpressed, in her own convivial manner, by an additional tightness \nof face, thin elongation of compressed lips, and sidewise look, \nwhich intense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my \nLady\'s mirrors when my Lady is not among them.\n\nAll the mirrors in the house are brought into action now, many of \nthem after a long blank.  They reflect handsome faces, simpering \nfaces, youthful faces, faces of threescore and ten that will not \nsubmit to be old; the entire collection of faces that have come to \npass a January week or two at Chesney Wold, and which the \nfashionable intelligence, a mighty hunter before the Lord, hunts \nwith a keen scent, from their breaking cover at the Court of St. \nJames\'s to their being run down to death.  The place in Lincolnshire \nis all alive.  By day guns and voices are heard ringing in the \nwoods, horsemen and carriages enliven the park roads, servants and \nhangers-on pervade the village and the Dedlock Arms.  Seen by night \nfrom distant openings in the trees, the row of windows in the long \ndrawing-room, where my Lady\'s picture hangs over the great chimney-\npiece, is like a row of jewels set in a black frame.  On Sunday the \nchill little church is almost warmed by so much gallant company, and \nthe general flavour of the Dedlock dust is quenched in delicate \nperfumes.\n\nThe brilliant and distinguished circle comprehends within it no \ncontracted amount of education, sense, courage, honour, beauty, and \nvirtue.  Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite \nof its immense advantages.  What can it be?\n\nDandyism?  There is no King George the Fourth now (more the pity) to \nset the dandy fashion; there are no clear-starched jack-towel \nneckcloths, no short-waisted coats, no false calves, no stays.  \nThere are no caricatures, now, of effeminate exquisites so arrayed, \nswooning in opera boxes with excess of delight and being revived by \nother dainty creatures poking long-necked scent-bottles at their \nnoses.  There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake \ninto his buckskins, or who goes to see all the executions, or who is \ntroubled with the self-reproach of having once consumed a pea.  But \nis there dandyism in the brilliant and distinguished circle \nnotwithstanding, dandyism of a more mischievous sort, that has got \nbelow the surface and is doing less harmless things than jack-\ntowelling itself and stopping its own digestion, to which no \nrational person need particularly object?\n\nWhy, yes.  It cannot be disguised.  There ARE at Chesney Wold this \nJanuary week some ladies and gentlemen of the newest fashion, who \nhave set up a dandyism--in religion, for instance.  Who in mere \nlackadaisical want of an emotion have agreed upon a little dandy \ntalk about the vulgar wanting faith in things in general, meaning in \nthe things that have been tried and found wanting, as though a low \nfellow should unaccountably lose faith in a bad shilling after \nfinding it out!  Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and \nfaithful by putting back the hands upon the clock of time and \ncancelling a few hundred years of history.\n\nThere are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion, not so new, \nbut very elegant, who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world \nand to keep down all its realities.  For whom everything must be \nlanguid and pretty.  Who have found out the perpetual stoppage.  Who \nare to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing.  Who are not to \nbe disturbed by ideas.  On whom even the fine arts, attending in \npowder and walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain, must array \nthemselves in the milliners\' and tailors\' patterns of past \ngenerations and be particularly careful not to be in earnest or to \nreceive any impress from the moving age.\n\nThen there is my Lord Boodle, of considerable reputation with his \nparty, who has known what office is and who tells Sir Leicester \nDedlock with much gravity, after dinner, that he really does not see \nto what the present age is tending.  A debate is not what a debate \nused to be; the House is not what the House used to be; even a \nCabinet is not what it formerly was.  He perceives with astonishment \nthat supposing the present government to be overthrown, the limited \nchoice of the Crown, in the formation of a new ministry, would lie \nbetween Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle--supposing it to be \nimpossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle, which may be \nassumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of \nthat affair with Hoodle.  Then, giving the Home Department and the \nleadership of the House of Commons to Joodle, the Exchequer to \nKoodle, the Colonies to Loodle, and the Foreign Office to Moodle, \nwhat are you to do with Noodle?  You can\'t offer him the Presidency \nof the Council; that is reserved for Poodle.  You can\'t put him in \nthe Woods and Forests; that is hardly good enough for Quoodle.  What \nfollows?  That the country is shipwrecked, lost, and gone to pieces \n(as is made manifest to the patriotism of Sir Leicester Dedlock) \nbecause you can\'t provide for Noodle!\n\nOn the other hand, the Right Honourable William Buffy, M.P., \ncontends across the table with some one else that the shipwreck of \nthe country--about which there is no doubt; it is only the manner of \nit that is in question--is attributable to Cuffy.  If you had done \nwith Cuffy what you ought to have done when he first came into \nParliament, and had prevented him from going over to Duffy, you \nwould have got him into alliance with Fuffy, you would have had with \nyou the weight attaching as a smart debater to Guffy, you would have \nbrought to bear upon the elections the wealth of Huffy, you would \nhave got in for three counties Juffy, Kuffy, and Luffy, and you \nwould have strengthened your administration by the official \nknowledge and the business habits of Muffy.  All this, instead of \nbeing as you now are, dependent on the mere caprice of Puffy!\n\nAs to this point, and as to some minor topics, there are differences \nof opinion; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and \ndistinguished circle, all round, that nobody is in question but \nBoodle and his retinue, and Buffy and HIS retinue.  These are the \ngreat actors for whom the stage is reserved.  A People there are, no \ndoubt--a certain large number of supernumeraries, who are to be \noccasionally addressed, and relied upon for shouts and choruses, as \non the theatrical stage; but Boodle and Buffy, their followers and \nfamilies, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, are \nthe born first-actors, managers, and leaders, and no others can \nappear upon the scene for ever and ever.\n\nIn this, too, there is perhaps more dandyism at Chesney Wold than \nthe brilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in \nthe long run.  For it is, even with the stillest and politest \ncircles, as with the circle the necromancer draws around him--very \nstrange appearances may be seen in active motion outside.  With this \ndifference, that being realities and not phantoms, there is the \ngreater danger of their breaking in.\n\nChesney Wold is quite full anyhow, so full that a burning sense of \ninjury arises in the breasts of ill-lodged ladies\'-maids, and is not \nto he extinguished.  Only one room is empty.  It is a turret chamber \nof the third order of merit, plainly but comfortably furnished and \nhaving an old-fashioned business air.  It is Mr. Tulkinghorn\'s room, \nand is never bestowed on anybody else, for he may come at any time.  \nHe is not come yet.  It is his quiet habit to walk across the park \nfrom the village in fine weather, to drop into this room as if he \nhad never been out of it since he was last seen there, to request a \nservant to inform Sir Leicester that he is arrived in case he should \nbe wanted, and to appear ten minutes before dinner in the shadow of \nthe library-door.  He sleeps in his turret with a complaining flag-\nstaff over his head, and has some leads outside on which, any fine \nmorning when he is down here, his black figure may be seen walking \nbefore breakfast like a larger species of rook.\n\nEvery day before dinner, my Lady looks for him in the dusk of the \nlibrary, but he is not there.  Every day at dinner, my Lady glances \ndown the table for the vacant place that would be waiting to receive \nhim if he had just arrived, but there is no vacant place.  Every \nnight my Lady casually asks her maid, \"Is Mr. Tulkinghorn come?\"\n\nEvery night the answer is, \"No, my Lady, not yet.\"\n\nOne night, while having her hair undressed, my Lady loses herself in \ndeep thought after this reply until she sees her own brooding face \nin the opposite glass, and a pair of black eyes curiously observing \nher.\n\n\"Be so good as to attend,\" says my Lady then, addressing the \nreflection of Hortense, \"to your business.  You can contemplate your \nbeauty at another time.\"\n\n\"Pardon!  It was your Ladyship\'s beauty.\"\n\n\"That,\" says my Lady, \"you needn\'t contemplate at all.\"\n\nAt length, one afternoon a little before sunset, when the bright \ngroups of figures which have for the last hour or two enlivened the \nGhost\'s Walk are all dispersed and only Sir Leicester and my Lady \nremain upon the terrace, Mr. Tulkinghorn appears.  He comes towards \nthem at his usual methodical pace, which is never quickened, never \nslackened.  He wears his usual expressionless mask--if it be a mask\n--and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every \ncrease of his dress.  Whether his whole soul is devoted to the great \nor whether he yields them nothing beyond the services he sells is \nhis personal secret.  He keeps it, as he keeps the secrets of his \nclients; he is his own client in that matter, and will never betray \nhimself.\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his \nhand.\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn is quite well.  Sir Leicester is quite well.  My \nLady is quite well.  All highly satisfactory.  The lawyer, with his \nhands behind him, walks at Sir Leicester\'s side along the terrace.  \nMy Lady walks upon the other side.\n\n\"We expected you before,\" says Sir Leicester.  A gracious \nobservation.  As much as to say, \"Mr. Tulkinghorn, we remember your \nexistence when you are not here to remind us of it by your presence.  \nWe bestow a fragment of our minds upon you, sir, you see!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn, comprehending it, inclines his head and says he is \nmuch obliged.\n\n\"I should have come down sooner,\" he explains, \"but that I have been \nmuch engaged with those matters in the several suits between \nyourself and Boythorn.\"\n\n\"A man of a very ill-regulated mind,\" observes Sir Leicester with \nseverity.  \"An extremely dangerous person in any community.  A man \nof a very low character of mind.\"\n\n\"He is obstinate,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\n\"It is natural to such a man to be so,\" says Sir Leicester, looking \nmost profoundly obstinate himself.  \"I am not at all surprised to \nhear it.\"\n\n\"The only question is,\" pursues the lawyer, \"whether you will give \nup anything.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replies Sir Leicester.  \"Nothing.  I give up?\"\n\n\"I don\'t mean anything of importance.  That, of course, I know you \nwould not abandon.  I mean any minor point.\"\n\n\"Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" returns Sir Leicester, \"there can be no minor \npoint between myself and Mr. Boythorn.  If I go farther, and observe \nthat I cannot readily conceive how ANY right of mine can be a minor \npoint, I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual \nas in reference to the family position I have it in charge to \nmaintain.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head again.  \"I have now my \ninstructions,\" he says.  \"Mr. Boythorn will give us a good deal of \ntrouble--\"\n\n\"It is the character of such a mind, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" Sir Leicester \ninterrupts him, \"TO give trouble.  An exceedingly ill-conditioned, \nlevelling person.  A person who, fifty years ago, would probably \nhave been tried at the Old Bailey for some demagogue proceeding, and \nseverely punished--if not,\" adds Sir Leicester after a moment\'s \npause, \"if not hanged, drawn, and quartered.\"\n\nSir Leicester appears to discharge his stately breast of a burden in \npassing this capital sentence, as if it were the next satisfactory \nthing to having the sentence executed.\n\n\"But night is coming on,\" says he, \"and my Lady will take cold.  My \ndear, let us go in.\"\n\nAs they turn towards the hall-door, Lady Dedlock addresses Mr. \nTulkinghorn for the first time.\n\n\"You sent me a message respecting the person whose writing I \nhappened to inquire about.  It was like you to remember the \ncircumstance; I had quite forgotten it.  Your message reminded me of \nit again.  I can\'t imagine what association I had with a hand like \nthat, but I surely had some.\"\n\n\"You had some?\" Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" returns my Lady carelessly.  \"I think I must have had \nsome.  And did you really take the trouble to find out the writer of \nthat actual thing--what is it!--affidavit?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How very odd!\"\n\nThey pass into a sombre breakfast-room on the ground floor, lighted \nin the day by two deep windows.  It is now twilight.  The fire glows \nbrightly on the panelled wall and palely on the window-glass, where, \nthrough the cold reflection of the blaze, the colder landscape \nshudders in the wind and a grey mist creeps along, the only \ntraveller besides the waste of clouds.\n\nMy Lady lounges in a great chair in the chimney-corner, and Sir \nLeicester takes another great chair opposite.  The lawyer stands \nbefore the fire with his hand out at arm\'s length, shading his face.  \nHe looks across his arm at my Lady.\n\n\"Yes,\" he says, \"I inquired about the man, and found him.  And, what \nis very strange, I found him--\"\n\n\"Not to be any out-of-the-way person, I am afraid!\" Lady Dedlock \nlanguidly anticipates.\n\n\"I found him dead.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear me!\" remonstrated Sir Leicester.  Not so much shocked by \nthe fact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned.\n\n\"I was directed to his lodging--a miserable, poverty-stricken place\n--and I found him dead.\"\n\n\"You will excuse me, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" observes Sir Leicester.  \"I \nthink the less said--\"\n\n\"Pray, Sir Leicester, let me hear the story out\" (it is my Lady \nspeaking).  \"It is quite a story for twilight.  How very shocking!  \nDead?\"\n\nMr, Tulkinghorn re-asserts it by another inclination of his head.  \n\"Whether by his own hand--\"\n\n\"Upon my honour!\" cries Sir Leicester.  \"Really!\"\n\n\"Do let me hear the story!\" says my Lady.\n\n\"Whatever you desire, my dear.  But, I must say--\"\n\n\"No, you mustn\'t say!  Go on, Mr. Tulkinghorn.\"\n\nSir Leicester\'s gallantry concedes the point, though he still feels \nthat to bring this sort of squalor among the upper classes is \nreally--really--\n\n\"I was about to say,\" resumes the lawyer with undisturbed calmness, \n\"that whether he had died by his own hand or not, it was beyond my \npower to tell you.  I should amend that phrase, however, by saying \nthat he had unquestionably died of his own act, though whether by \nhis own deliberate intention or by mischance can never certainly be \nknown.  The coroner\'s jury found that he took the poison \naccidentally.\"\n\n\"And what kind of man,\" my Lady asks, \"was this deplorable \ncreature?\"\n\n\"Very difficult to say,\" returns the lawyer, shaking his bead.  \"He \nhad lived so wretchedly and was so neglected, with his gipsy colour \nand his wild black hair and beard, that I should have considered him \nthe commonest of the common.  The surgeon had a notion that he had \nonce been something better, both in appearance and condition.\"\n\n\"What did they call the wretched being?\"\n\n\"They called him what he had called himself, but no one knew his \nname.\"\n\n\"Not even any one who had attended on him?\"\n\n\"No one had attended on him.  He was found dead.  In fact, I found \nhim.\"\n\n\"Without any clue to anything more?\"\n\n\"Without any; there was,\" says the lawyer meditatively, \"an old \nportmanteau, but--  No, there were no papers.\"\n\nDuring the utterance of every word of this short dialogue, Lady \nDedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn, without any other alteration in their \ncustomary deportment, have looked very steadily at one another--as \nwas natural, perhaps, in the discussion of so unusual a subject.  \nSir Leicester has looked at the fire, with the general expression of \nthe Dedlock on the staircase.  The story being told, he renews his \nstately protest, saying that as it is quite clear that no \nassociation in my Lady\'s mind can possibly be traceable to this poor \nwretch (unless he was a begging-letter writer), he trusts to hear no \nmore about a subject so far removed from my Lady\'s station.\n\n\"Certainly, a collection of horrors,\" says my Lady, gathering up her \nmantles and furs, \"but they interest one for the moment!  Have the \nkindness, Mr. Tulkinghorn, to open the door for me.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference and holds it open while she \npasses out.  She passes close to him, with her usual fatigued manner \nand insolent grace.  They meet again at dinner--again, next day--\nagain, for many days in succession.  Lady Dedlock is always the same \nexhausted deity, surrounded by worshippers, and terribly liable to \nbe bored to death, even while presiding at her own shrine.  Mr. \nTulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble \nconfidences, so oddly but of place and yet so perfectly at home.  \nThey appear to take as little note of one another as any two people \nenclosed within the same walls could.  But whether each evermore \nwatches and suspects the other, evermore mistrustful of some great \nreservation; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the \nother, and never to be taken unawares; what each would give to know \nhow much the other knows--all this is hidden, for the time, in their \nown hearts.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nEsther\'s Narrative\n\n\nWe held many consultations about what Richard was to be, first \nwithout Mr. Jarndyce, as he had requested, and afterwards with him, \nbut it was a long time before we seemed to make progress.  Richard \nsaid he was ready for anything.  When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether \nhe might not already be too old to enter the Navy, Richard said he \nhad thought of that, and perhaps he was.  When Mr. Jarndyce asked \nhim what he thought of the Army, Richard said he had thought of \nthat, too, and it wasn\'t a bad idea.  When Mr. Jarndyce advised him \nto try and decide within himself whether his old preference for the \nsea was an ordinary boyish inclination or a strong impulse, Richard \nanswered, Well he really HAD tried very often, and he couldn\'t make \nout.\n\n\"How much of this indecision of character,\" Mr. Jarndyce said to me, \n\"is chargeable on that incomprehensible heap of uncertainty and \nprocrastination on which he has been thrown from his birth, I don\'t \npretend to say; but that Chancery, among its other sins, is \nresponsible for some of it, I can plainly see.  It has engendered or \nconfirmed in him a habit of putting off--and trusting to this, that, \nand the other chance, without knowing what chance--and dismissing \neverything as unsettled, uncertain, and confused.  The character of \nmuch older and steadier people may be even changed by the \ncircumstances surrounding them.  It would be too much to expect that \na boy\'s, in its formation, should be the subject of such influences \nand escape them.\"\n\nI felt this to be true; though if I may venture to mention what I \nthought besides, I thought it much to be regretted that Richard\'s \neducation had not counteracted those influences or directed his \ncharacter.  He had been eight years at a public school and had \nlearnt, I understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in the \nmost admirable manner. ";
