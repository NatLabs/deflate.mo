The\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\nfiles per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach 80 billion Etexts.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\n\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/BU\":  and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

They are England and Scotland, and Ireland.  England and \nScotland form the greater part of these Islands.  Ireland is the \nnext in size.  The little neighbouring islands, which are so small \nupon the Map as to be mere dots, are chiefly little bits of \nScotland, - broken off, I dare say, in the course of a great length \nof time, by the power of the restless water.\n\nIn the old days, a long, long while ago, before Our Saviour was \nborn on earth and lay asleep in a manger, these Islands were in the \nsame place, and the stormy sea roared round them, just as it roars \nnow.  But the sea was not alive, then, with great ships and brave \nsailors, sailing to and from all parts of the world.  It was very \nlonely.  The Islands lay solitary, in the great expanse of water.  \nThe foaming waves dashed against their cliffs, and the bleak winds \nblew over their forests; but the winds and waves brought no \nadventurers to land upon the Islands, and the savage Islanders knew \nnothing of the rest of the world, and the rest of the world knew \nnothing of them.\n\nIt is supposed that the Phoenicians, who were an ancient people, \nfamous for carrying on trade, came in ships to these Islands, and \nfound that they produced tin and lead; both very useful things, as \nyou know, and both produced to this very hour upon the sea-coast. \nThe most celebrated tin mines in Cornwall are, still, close to the \nsea.  One of them, which I have seen, is so close to it that it is \nhollowed out underneath the ocean; and the miners say, that in \nstormy weather, when they are at work down in that deep place, they \ncan hear the noise of the waves thundering above their heads.  So, \nthe Phoenicians, coasting about the Islands, would come, without \nmuch difficulty, to where the tin and lead were.\n\nThe Phoenicians traded with the Islanders for these metals, and \ngave the Islanders some other useful things in exchange.  The \nIslanders were, at first, poor savages, going almost naked, or only \ndressed in the rough skins of beasts, and staining their bodies, as \nother savages do, with coloured earths and the juices of plants.  \nBut the Phoenicians, sailing over to the opposite coasts of France \nand Belgium, and saying to the people there, \'We have been to those \nwhite cliffs across the water, which you can see in fine weather, \nand from that country, which is called BRITAIN, we bring this tin \nand lead,\' tempted some of the French and Belgians to come over \nalso.  These people settled themselves on the south coast of \nEngland, which is now called Kent; and, although they were a rough \npeople too, they taught the savage Britons some useful arts, and \nimproved that part of the Islands.  It is probable that other \npeople came over from Spain to Ireland, and settled there.\n\nThus, by little and little, strangers became mixed with the \nIslanders, and the savage Britons grew into a wild, bold people; \nalmost savage, still, especially in the interior of the country \naway from the sea where the foreign settlers seldom went; but \nhardy, brave, and strong.\n\nThe whole country was covered with forests, and swamps.  The \ngreater part of it was very misty and cold.  There were no roads, \nno bridges, no streets, no houses that you would think deserving of \nthe name.  A town was nothing but a collection of straw-covered \nhuts, hidden in a thick wood, with a ditch all round, and a low \nwall, made of mud, or the trunks of trees placed one upon another.  \nThe people planted little or no corn, but lived upon the flesh of \ntheir flocks and cattle.  They made no coins, but used metal rings \nfor money.  They were clever in basket-work, as savage people often \nare; and they could make a coarse kind of cloth, and some very bad \nearthenware.  But in building fortresses they were much more \nclever.\n\nThey made boats of basket-work, covered with the skins of animals, \nbut seldom, if ever, ventured far from the shore.  They made \nswords, of copper mixed with tin; but, these swords were of an \nawkward shape, and so soft that a heavy blow would bend one.  They \nmade light shields, short pointed daggers, and spears - which they \njerked back after they had thrown them at an enemy, by a long strip \nof leather fastened to the stem.  The butt-end was a rattle, to \nfrighten an enemy\'s horse.  The ancient Britons, being divided into \nas many as thirty or forty tribes, each commanded by its own little \nking, were constantly fighting with one another, as savage people \nusually do; and they always fought with these weapons.\n\nThey were very fond of horses.  The standard of Kent was the \npicture of a white horse.  They could break them in and manage them \nwonderfully well.  Indeed, the horses (of which they had an \nabundance, though they were rather small) were so well taught in \nthose days, that they can scarcely be said to have improved since; \nthough the men are so much wiser.  They understood, and obeyed, \nevery word of command; and would stand still by themselves, in all \nthe din and noise of battle, while their masters went to fight on \nfoot.  The Britons could not have succeeded in their most \nremarkable art, without the aid of these sensible and trusty \nanimals.  The art I mean, is the construction and management of \nwar-chariots or cars, for which they have ever been celebrated in \nhistory.  Each of the best sort of these chariots, not quite breast \nhigh in front, and open at the back, contained one man to drive, \nand two or three others to fight - all standing up.  The horses who \ndrew them were so well trained, that they would tear, at full \ngallop, over the most stony ways, and even through the woods; \ndashing down their masters\' enemies beneath their hoofs, and \ncutting them to pieces with the blades of swords, or scythes, which \nwere fastened to the wheels, and stretched out beyond the car on \neach side, for that cruel purpose.  In a moment, while at full \nspeed, the horses would stop, at the driver\'s command.  The men \nwithin would leap out, deal blows about them with their swords like \nhail, leap on the horses, on the pole, spring back into the \nchariots anyhow; and, as soon as they were safe, the horses tore \naway again.\n\nThe Britons had a strange and terrible religion, called the \nReligion of the Druids.  It seems to have been brought over, in \nvery early times indeed, from the opposite country of France, \nanciently called Gaul, and to have mixed up the worship of the \nSerpent, and of the Sun and Moon, with the worship of some of the \nHeathen Gods and Goddesses.  Most of its ceremonies were kept \nsecret by the priests, the Druids, who pretended to be enchanters, \nand who carried magicians\' wands, and wore, each of them, about his \nneck, what he told the ignorant people was a Serpent\'s egg in a \ngolden case.  But it is certain that the Druidical ceremonies \nincluded the sacrifice of human victims, the torture of some \nsuspected criminals, and, on particular occasions, even the burning \nalive, in immense wicker cages, of a number of men and animals \ntogether.  The Druid Priests had some kind of veneration for the \nOak, and for the mistletoe - the same plant that we hang up in \nhouses at Christmas Time now - when its white berries grew upon the \nOak.  They met together in dark woods, which they called Sacred \nGroves; and there they instructed, in their mysterious arts, young \nmen who came to them as pupils, and who sometimes stayed with them \nas long as twenty years.\n\nThese Druids built great Temples and altars, open to the sky, \nfragments of some of which are yet remaining.  Stonehenge, on \nSalisbury Plain, in Wiltshire, is the most extraordinary of these.  \nThree curious stones, called Kits Coty House, on Bluebell Hill, \nnear Maidstone, in Kent, form another.  We know, from examination \nof the great blocks of which such buildings are made, that they \ncould not have been raised without the aid of some ingenious \nmachines, which are common now, but which the ancient Britons \ncertainly did not use in making their own uncomfortable houses.  I \nshould not wonder if the Druids, and their pupils who stayed with \nthem twenty years, knowing more than the rest of the Britons, kept \nthe people out of sight while they made these buildings, and then \npretended that they built them by magic.  Perhaps they had a hand \nin the fortresses too; at all events, as they were very powerful, \nand very much believed in, and as they made and executed the laws, \nand paid no taxes, I don\'t wonder that they liked their trade.  \nAnd, as they persuaded the people the more Druids there were, the \nbetter off the people would be, I don\'t wonder that there were a \ngood many of them.  But it is pleasant to think that there are no \nDruids, NOW, who go on in that way, and pretend to carry \nEnchanters\' Wands and Serpents\' Eggs - and of course there is \nnothing of the kind, anywhere.\n\nSuch was the improved condition of the ancient Britons, fifty-five \nyears before the birth of Our Saviour, when the Romans, under their \ngreat General, Julius Caesar, were masters of all the rest of the \nknown world.  Julius Caesar had then just conquered Gaul; and \nhearing, in Gaul, a good deal about the opposite Island with the \nwhite cliffs, and about the bravery of the Britons who inhabited it \n- some of whom had been fetched over to help the Gauls in the war \nagainst him - he resolved, as he was so near, to come and conquer \nBritain next.\n\nSo, Julius Caesar came sailing over to this Island of ours, with \neighty vessels and twelve thousand men.  And he came from the \nFrench coast between Calais and Boulogne, \'because thence was the \nshortest passage into Britain;\' just for the same reason as our \nsteam-boats now take the same track, every day.  He expected to \nconquer Britain easily:  but it was not such easy work as he \nsupposed - for the bold Britons fought most bravely; and, what with \nnot having his horse-soldiers with him (for they had been driven \nback by a storm), and what with having some of his vessels dashed \nto pieces by a high tide after they were drawn ashore, he ran great \nrisk of being totally defeated.  However, for once that the bold \nBritons beat him, he beat them twice; though not so soundly but \nthat he was very glad to accept their proposals of peace, and go \naway.\n\nBut, in the spring of the next year, he came back; this time, with \neight hundred vessels and thirty thousand men.  The British tribes \nchose, as their general-in-chief, a Briton, whom the Romans in \ntheir Latin language called CASSIVELLAUNUS, but whose British name \nis supposed to have been CASWALLON.  A brave general he was, and \nwell he and his soldiers fought the Roman army!  So well, that \nwhenever in that war the Roman soldiers saw a great cloud of dust, \nand heard the rattle of the rapid British chariots, they trembled \nin their hearts.  Besides a number of smaller battles, there was a \nbattle fought near Canterbury, in Kent; there was a battle fought \nnear Chertsey, in Surrey; there was a battle fought near a marshy \nlittle town in a wood, the capital of that part of Britain which \nbelonged to CASSIVELLAUNUS, and which was probably near what is now \nSaint Albans, in Hertfordshire.  However, brave CASSIVELLAUNUS had \nthe worst of it, on the whole; though he and his men always fought \nlike lions.  As the other British chiefs were jealous of him, and \nwere always quarrelling with him, and with one another, he gave up, \nand proposed peace.  Julius Caesar was very glad to grant peace \neasily, and to go away again with all his remaining ships and men.  \nHe had expected to find pearls in Britain, and he may have found a \nfew for anything I know; but, at all events, he found delicious \noysters, and I am sure he found tough Britons - of whom, I dare \nsay, he made the same complaint as Napoleon Bonaparte the great \nFrench General did, eighteen hundred years afterwards, when he said \nthey were such unreasonable fellows that they never knew when they \nwere beaten.  They never DID know, I believe, and never will.\n\nNearly a hundred years passed on, and all that time, there was \npeace in Britain.  The Britons improved their towns and mode of \nlife:  became more civilised, travelled, and learnt a great deal \nfrom the Gauls and Romans.  At last, the Roman Emperor, Claudius, \nsent AULUS PLAUTIUS, a skilful general, with a mighty force, to \nsubdue the Island, and shortly afterwards arrived himself.  They \ndid little; and OSTORIUS SCAPULA, another general, came.  Some of \nthe British Chiefs of Tribes submitted.  Others resolved to fight \nto the death.  Of these brave men, the bravest was CARACTACUS, or \nCARADOC, who gave battle to the Romans, with his army, among the \nmountains of North Wales.  \'This day,\' said he to his soldiers, \n\'decides the fate of Britain!  Your liberty, or your eternal \nslavery, dates from this hour.  Remember your brave ancestors, who \ndrove the great Caesar himself across the sea!\'  On hearing these \nwords, his men, with a great shout, rushed upon the Romans.  But \nthe strong Roman swords and armour were too much for the weaker \nBritish weapons in close conflict.  The Britons lost the day.  The \nwife and daughter of the brave CARACTACUS were taken prisoners; his \nbrothers delivered themselves up; he himself was betrayed into the \nhands of the Romans by his false and base stepmother:  and they \ncarried him, and all his family, in triumph to Rome.\n\nBut a great man will be great in misfortune, great in prison, great \nin chains.  His noble air, and dignified endurance of distress, so \ntouched the Roman people who thronged the streets to see him, that \nhe and his family were restored to freedom.  No one knows whether \nhis great heart broke, and he died in Rome, or whether he ever \nreturned to his own dear country.  English oaks have grown up from \nacorns, and withered away, when they were hundreds of years old - \nand other oaks have sprung up in their places, and died too, very \naged - since the rest of the history of the brave CARACTACUS was \nforgotten.\n\nStill, the Britons WOULD NOT yield.  They rose again and again, and \ndied by thousands, sword in hand.  They rose, on every possible \noccasion.  SUETONIUS, another Roman general, came, and stormed the \nIsland of Anglesey (then called MONA), which was supposed to be \nsacred, and he burnt the Druids in their own wicker cages, by their \nown fires.  But, even while he was in Britain, with his victorious \ntroops, the BRITONS rose.  Because BOADICEA, a British queen, the \nwidow of the King of the Norfolk and Suffolk people, resisted the \nplundering of her property by the Romans who were settled in \nEngland, she was scourged, by order of CATUS a Roman officer; and \nher two daughters were shamefully insulted in her presence, and her \nhusband\'s relations were made slaves.  To avenge this injury, the \nBritons rose, with all their might and rage.  They drove CATUS into \nGaul; they laid the Roman possessions waste; they forced the Romans \nout of London, then a poor little town, but a trading place; they \nhanged, burnt, crucified, and slew by the sword, seventy thousand \nRomans in a few days.  SUETONIUS strengthened his army, and \nadvanced to give them battle.  They strengthened their army, and \ndesperately attacked his, on the field where it was strongly \nposted.  Before the first charge of the Britons was made, BOADICEA, \nin a war-chariot, with her fair hair streaming in the wind, and her \ninjured daughters lying at her feet, drove among the troops, and \ncried to them for vengeance on their oppressors, the licentious \nRomans.  The Britons fought to the last; but they were vanquished \nwith great slaughter, and the unhappy queen took poison.\n\nStill, the spirit of the Britons was not broken.  When SUETONIUS \nleft the country, they fell upon his troops, and retook the Island \nof Anglesey.  AGRICOLA came, fifteen or twenty years afterwards, \nand retook it once more, and devoted seven years to subduing the \ncountry, especially that part of it which is now called SCOTLAND; \nbut, its people, the Caledonians, resisted him at every inch of \nground.  They fought the bloodiest battles with him; they killed \ntheir very wives and children, to prevent his making prisoners of \nthem; they fell, fighting, in such great numbers that certain hills \nin Scotland are yet supposed to be vast heaps of stones piled up \nabove their graves.  HADRIAN came, thirty years afterwards, and \nstill they resisted him.  SEVERUS came, nearly a hundred years \nafterwards, and they worried his great army like dogs, and rejoiced \nto see them die, by thousands, in the bogs and swamps.  CARACALLA, \nthe son and successor of SEVERUS, did the most to conquer them, for \na time; but not by force of arms.  He knew how little that would \ndo.  He yielded up a quantity of land to the Caledonians, and gave \nthe Britons the same privileges as the Romans possessed.  There was \npeace, after this, for seventy years.\n\nThen new enemies arose.  They were the Saxons, a fierce, sea-faring \npeople from the countries to the North of the Rhine, the great \nriver of Germany on the banks of which the best grapes grow to make \nthe German wine.  They began to come, in pirate ships, to the sea-\ncoast of Gaul and Britain, and to plunder them.  They were repulsed \nby CARAUSIUS, a native either of Belgium or of Britain, who was \nappointed by the Romans to the command, and under whom the Britons \nfirst began to fight upon the sea.  But, after this time, they \nrenewed their ravages.  A few years more, and the Scots (which was \nthen the name for the people of Ireland), and the Picts, a northern \npeople, began to make frequent plundering incursions into the South \nof Britain.  All these attacks were repeated, at intervals, during \ntwo hundred years, and through a long succession of Roman Emperors \nand chiefs; during all which length of time, the Britons rose \nagainst the Romans, over and over again.  At last, in the days of \nthe Roman HONORIUS, when the Roman power all over the world was \nfast declining, and when Rome wanted all her soldiers at home, the \nRomans abandoned all hope of conquering Britain, and went away.  \nAnd still, at last, as at first, the Britons rose against them, in \ntheir old brave manner; for, a very little while before, they had \nturned away the Roman magistrates, and declared themselves an \nindependent people.\n\nFive hundred years had passed, since Julius Caesar\'s first invasion \nof the Island, when the Romans departed from it for ever.  In the \ncourse of that time, although they had been the cause of terrible \nfighting and bloodshed, they had done much to improve the condition \nof the Britons.  They had made great military roads; they had built \nforts; they had taught them how to dress, and arm themselves, much \nbetter than they had ever known how to do before; they had refined \nthe whole British way of living.  AGRICOLA had built a great wall \nof earth, more than seventy miles long, extending from Newcastle to \nbeyond Carlisle, for the purpose of keeping out the Picts and \nScots; HADRIAN had strengthened it; SEVERUS, finding it much in \nwant of repair, had built it afresh of stone.\n\nAbove all, it was in the Roman time, and by means of Roman ships, \nthat the Christian Religion was first brought into Britain, and its \npeople first taught the great lesson that, to be good in the sight \nof GOD, they must love their neighbours as themselves, and do unto \nothers as they would be done by.  The Druids declared that it was \nvery wicked to believe in any such thing, and cursed all the people \nwho did believe it, very heartily.  But, when the people found that \nthey were none the better for the blessings of the Druids, and none \nthe worse for the curses of the Druids, but, that the sun shone and \nthe rain fell without consulting the Druids at all, they just began \nto think that the Druids were mere men, and that it signified very \nlittle whether they cursed or blessed.  After which, the pupils of \nthe Druids fell off greatly in numbers, and the Druids took to \nother trades.\n\nThus I have come to the end of the Roman time in England.  It is \nbut little that is known of those five hundred years; but some \nremains of them are still found.  Often, when labourers are digging \nup the ground, to make foundations for houses or churches, they \nlight on rusty money that once belonged to the Romans.  Fragments \nof plates from which they ate, of goblets from which they drank, \nand of pavement on which they trod, are discovered among the earth \nthat is broken by the plough, or the dust that is crumbled by the \ngardener\'s spade.  Wells that the Romans sunk, still yield water; \nroads that the Romans made, form part of our highways.  In some old \nbattle-fields, British spear-heads and Roman armour have been \nfound, mingled together in decay, as they fell in the thick \npressure of the fight.  Traces of Roman camps overgrown with grass, \nand of mounds that are the burial-places of heaps of Britons, are \nto be seen in almost all parts of the country.  Across the bleak \nmoors of Northumberland, the wall of SEVERUS, overrun with moss and \nweeds, still stretches, a strong ruin; and the shepherds and their \ndogs lie sleeping on it in the summer weather.  On Salisbury Plain, \nStonehenge yet stands:  a monument of the earlier time when the \nRoman name was unknown in Britain, and when the Druids, with their \nbest magic wands, could not have written it in the sands of the \nwild sea-shore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II - ANCIENT ENGLAND UNDER THE EARLY SAXONS\n\n\n\nTHE Romans had scarcely gone away from Britain, when the Britons \nbegan to wish they had never left it.  For, the Romans being gone, \nand the Britons being much reduced in numbers by their long wars, \nthe Picts and Scots came pouring in, over the broken and unguarded \nwall of SEVERUS, in swarms.  They plundered the richest towns, and \nkilled the people; and came back so often for more booty and more \nslaughter, that the unfortunate Britons lived a life of terror.  As \nif the Picts and Scots were not bad enough on land, the Saxons \nattacked the islanders by sea; and, as if something more were still \nwanting to make them miserable, they quarrelled bitterly among \nthemselves as to what prayers they ought to say, and how they ought \nto say them.  The priests, being very angry with one another on \nthese questions, cursed one another in the heartiest manner; and \n(uncommonly like the old Druids) cursed all the people whom they \ncould not persuade.  So, altogether, the Britons were very badly \noff, you may believe.\n\nThey were in such distress, in short, that they sent a letter to \nRome entreating help - which they called the Groans of the Britons; \nand in which they said, \'The barbarians chase us into the sea, the \nsea throws us back upon the barbarians, and we have only the hard \nchoice left us of perishing by the sword, or perishing by the \nwaves.\'  But, the Romans could not help them, even if they were so \ninclined; for they had enough to do to defend themselves against \ntheir own enemies, who were then very fierce and strong.  At last, \nthe Britons, unable to bear their hard condition any longer, \nresolved to make peace with the Saxons, and to invite the Saxons to \ncome into their country, and help them to keep out the Picts and \nScots.\n\nIt was a British Prince named VORTIGERN who took this resolution, \nand who made a treaty of friendship with HENGIST and HORSA, two \nSaxon chiefs.  Both of these names, in the old Saxon language, \nsignify Horse; for the Saxons, like many other nations in a rough \nstate, were fond of giving men the names of animals, as Horse, \nWolf, Bear, Hound.  The Indians of North America, - a very inferior \npeople to the Saxons, though - do the same to this day.\n\nHENGIST and HORSA drove out the Picts and Scots; and VORTIGERN, \nbeing grateful to them for that service, made no opposition to \ntheir settling themselves in that part of England which is called \nthe Isle of Thanet, or to their inviting over more of their \ncountrymen to join them.  But HENGIST had a beautiful daughter \nnamed ROWENA; and when, at a feast, she filled a golden goblet to \nthe brim with wine, and gave it to VORTIGERN, saying in a sweet \nvoice, \'Dear King, thy health!\' the King fell in love with her.  My \nopinion is, that the cunning HENGIST meant him to do so, in order \nthat the Saxons might have greater influence with him; and that the \nfair ROWENA came to that feast, golden goblet and all, on purpose.\n\nAt any rate, they were married; and, long afterwards, whenever the \nKing was angry with the Saxons, or jealous of their encroachments, \nROWENA would put her beautiful arms round his neck, and softly say, \n\'Dear King, they are my people!  Be favourable to them, as you \nloved that Saxon girl who gave you the golden goblet of wine at the \nfeast!\'  And, really, I don\'t see how the King could help himself.\n\nAh!  We must all die!  In the course of years, VORTIGERN died - he \nwas dethroned, and put in prison, first, I am afraid; and ROWENA \ndied; and generations of Saxons and Britons died; and events that \nhappened during a long, long time, would have been quite forgotten \nbut for the tales and songs of the old Bards, who used to go about \nfrom feast to feast, with their white beards, recounting the deeds \nof their forefathers.  Among the histories of which they sang and \ntalked, there was a famous one, concerning the bravery and virtues \nof KING ARTHUR, supposed to have been a British Prince in those old \ntimes.  But, whether such a person really lived, or whether there \nwere several persons whose histories came to be confused together \nunder that one name, or whether all about him was invention, no one \nknows.\n\nI will tell you, shortly, what is most interesting in the early \nSaxon times, as they are described in these songs and stories of \nthe Bards.\n\nIn, and long after, the days of VORTIGERN, fresh bodies of Saxons, \nunder various chiefs, came pouring into Britain.  One body, \nconquering the Britons in the East, and settling there, called \ntheir kingdom Essex; another body settled in the West, and called \ntheir kingdom Wessex; the Northfolk, or Norfolk people, established \nthemselves in one place; the Southfolk, or Suffolk people, \nestablished themselves in another; and gradually seven kingdoms or \nstates arose in England, which were called the Saxon Heptarchy.  \nThe poor Britons, falling back before these crowds of fighting men \nwhom they had innocently invited over as friends, retired into \nWales and the adjacent country; into Devonshire, and into Cornwall.  \nThose parts of England long remained unconquered.  And in Cornwall \nnow - where the sea-coast is very gloomy, steep, and rugged - \nwhere, in the dark winter-time, ships have often been wrecked close \nto the land, and every soul on board has perished - where the winds \nand waves howl drearily and split the solid rocks into arches and \ncaverns - there are very ancient ruins, which the people call the \nruins of KING ARTHUR\'S Castle.\n\nKent is the most famous of the seven Saxon kingdoms, because the \nChristian religion was preached to the Saxons there (who domineered \nover the Britons too much, to care for what THEY said about their \nreligion, or anything else) by AUGUSTINE, a monk from Rome.  KING \nETHELBERT, of Kent, was soon converted; and the moment he said he \nwas a Christian, his courtiers all said THEY were Christians; after \nwhich, ten thousand of his subjects said they were Christians too.  \nAUGUSTINE built a little church, close to this King\'s palace, on \nthe ground now occupied by the beautiful cathedral of Canterbury.  \nSEBERT, the King\'s nephew, built on a muddy marshy place near \nLondon, where there had been a temple to Apollo, a church dedicated \nto Saint Peter, which is now Westminster Abbey.  And, in London \nitself, on the foundation of a temple to Diana, he built another \nlittle church which has risen up, since that old time, to be Saint \nPaul\'s.\n\nAfter the death of ETHELBERT, EDWIN, King of Northumbria, who was \nsuch a good king that it was said a woman or child might openly \ncarry a purse of gold, in his reign, without fear, allowed his \nchild to be baptised, and held a great council to consider whether \nhe and his people should all be Christians or not.  It was decided \nthat they should be.  COIFI, the chief priest of the old religion, \nmade a great speech on the occasion.  In this discourse, he told \nthe people that he had found out the old gods to be impostors.  \'I \nam quite satisfied of it,\' he said.  \'Look at me!  I have been \nserving them all my life, and they have done nothing for me; \nwhereas, if they had been really powerful, they could not have \ndecently done less, in return for all I have done for them, than \nmake my fortune.  As they have never made my fortune, I am quite \nconvinced they are impostors!\'  When this singular priest had \nfinished speaking, he hastily armed himself with sword and lance, \nmounted a war-horse, rode at a furious gallop in sight of all the \npeople to the temple, and flung his lance against it as an insult.  \nFrom that time, the Christian religion spread itself among the \nSaxons, and became their faith.\n\nThe next very famous prince was EGBERT.  He lived about a hundred \nand fifty years afterwards, and claimed to have a better right to \nthe throne of Wessex than BEORTRIC, another Saxon prince who was at \nthe head of that kingdom, and who married EDBURGA, the daughter of \nOFFA, king of another of the seven kingdoms.  This QUEEN EDBURGA \nwas a handsome murderess, who poisoned people when they offended \nher.  One day, she mixed a cup of poison for a certain noble \nbelonging to the court; but her husband drank of it too, by \nmistake, and died.  Upon this, the people revolted, in great \ncrowds; and running to the palace, and thundering at the gates, \ncried, \'Down with the wicked queen, who poisons men!\'  They drove \nher out of the country, and abolished the title she had disgraced.  \nWhen years had passed away, some travellers came home from Italy, \nand said that in the town of Pavia they had seen a ragged beggar-\nwoman, who had once been handsome, but was then shrivelled, bent, \nand yellow, wandering about the streets, crying for bread; and that \nthis beggar-woman was the poisoning English queen.  It was, indeed, \nEDBURGA; and so she died, without a shelter for her wretched head.\n\nEGBERT, not considering himself safe in England, in consequence of \nhis having claimed the crown of Wessex (for he thought his rival \nmight take him prisoner and put him to death), sought refuge at the \ncourt of CHARLEMAGNE, King of France.  On the death of BEORTRIC, so \nunhappily poisoned by mistake, EGBERT came back to Britain; \nsucceeded to the throne of Wessex; conquered some of the other \nmonarchs of the seven kingdoms; added their territories to his own; \nand, for the first time, called the country over which he ruled, \nENGLAND.\n\nAnd now, new enemies arose, who, for a long time, troubled England \nsorely.  These were the Northmen, the people of Denmark and Norway, \nwhom the English called the Danes.  They were a warlike people, \nquite at home upon the sea; not Christians; very daring and cruel.  \nThey came over in ships, and plundered and burned wheresoever they \nlanded.  Once, they beat EGBERT in battle.  Once, EGBERT beat them.  \nBut, they cared no more for being beaten than the English \nthemselves.  In the four following short reigns, of ETHELWULF, and \nhis sons, ETHELBALD, ETHELBERT, and ETHELRED, they came back, over \nand over again, burning and plundering, and laying England waste.  \nIn the last-mentioned reign, they seized EDMUND, King of East \nEngland, and bound him to a tree.  Then, they proposed to him that \nhe should change his religion; but he, being a good Christian, \nsteadily refused.  Upon that, they beat him, made cowardly jests \nupon him, all defenceless as he was, shot arrows at him, and, \nfinally, struck off his head.  It is impossible to say whose head \nthey might have struck off next, but for the death of KING ETHELRED \nfrom a wound he had received in fighting against them, and the \nsuccession to his throne of the best and wisest king that ever \nlived in England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III - ENGLAND UNDER THE GOOD SAXON, ALFRED\n\n\n\nALFRED THE GREAT was a young man, three-and-twenty years of age, \nwhen he became king.  Twice in his childhood, he had been taken to \nRome, where the Saxon nobles were in the habit of going on journeys \nwhich they supposed to be religious; and, once, he had stayed for \nsome time in Paris.  Learning, however, was so little cared for, \nthen, that at twelve years old he had not been taught to read; \nalthough, of the sons of KING ETHELWULF, he, the youngest, was the \nfavourite.  But he had - as most men who grow up to be great and \ngood are generally found to have had - an excellent mother; and, \none day, this lady, whose name was OSBURGA, happened, as she was \nsitting among her sons, to read a book of Saxon poetry.  The art of \nprinting was not known until long and long after that period, and \nthe book, which was written, was what is called \'illuminated,\' with \nbeautiful bright letters, richly painted.  The brothers admiring it \nvery much, their mother said, \'I will give it to that one of you \nfour princes who first learns to read.\'  ALFRED sought out a tutor \nthat very day, applied himself to learn with great diligence, and \nsoon won the book.  He was proud of it, all his life.\n\nThis great king, in the first year of his reign, fought nine \nbattles with the Danes.  He made some treaties with them too, by \nwhich the false Danes swore they would quit the country.  They \npretended to consider that they had taken a very solemn oath, in \nswearing this upon the holy bracelets that they wore, and which \nwere always buried with them when they died; but they cared little \nfor it, for they thought nothing of breaking oaths and treaties \ntoo, as soon as it suited their purpose, and coming back again to \nfight, plunder, and burn, as usual.  One fatal winter, in the \nfourth year of KING ALFRED\'S reign, they spread themselves in great \nnumbers over the whole of England; and so dispersed and routed the \nKing\'s soldiers that the King was left alone, and was obliged to \ndisguise himself as a common peasant, and to take refuge in the \ncottage of one of his cowherds who did not know his face.\n\nHere, KING ALFRED, while the Danes sought him far and near, was \nleft alone one day, by the cowherd\'s wife, to watch some cakes \nwhich she put to bake upon the hearth.  But, being at work upon his \nbow and arrows, with which he hoped to punish the false Danes when \na brighter time should come, and thinking deeply of his poor \nunhappy subjects whom the Danes chased through the land, his noble \nmind forgot the cakes, and they were burnt.  \'What!\' said the \ncowherd\'s wife, who scolded him well when she came back, and little \nthought she was scolding the King, \'you will be ready enough to eat \nthem by-and-by, and yet you cannot watch them, idle dog?\'\n\nAt length, the Devonshire men made head against a new host of Danes \nwho landed on their coast; killed their chief, and captured their \nflag; on which was represented the likeness of a Raven - a very fit \nbird for a thievish army like that, I think.  The loss of their \nstandard troubled the Danes greatly, for they believed it to be \nenchanted - woven by the three daughters of one father in a single \nafternoon - and they had a story among themselves that when they \nwere victorious in battle, the Raven stretched his wings and seemed \nto fly; and that when they were defeated, he would droop.  He had \ngood reason to droop, now, if he could have done anything half so \nsensible; for, KING ALFRED joined the Devonshire men; made a camp \nwith them on a piece of firm ground in the midst of a bog in \nSomersetshire; and prepared for a great attempt for vengeance on \nthe Danes, and the deliverance of his oppressed people.\n\nBut, first, as it was important to know how numerous those \npestilent Danes were, and how they were fortified, KING ALFRED, \nbeing a good musician, disguised himself as a glee-man or minstrel, \nand went, with his harp, to the Danish camp.  He played and sang in \nthe very tent of GUTHRUM the Danish leader, and entertained the \nDanes as they caroused.  While he seemed to think of nothing but \nhis music, he was watchful of their tents, their arms, their \ndiscipline, everything that he desired to know.  And right soon did \nthis great king entertain them to a different tune; for, summoning \nall his true followers to meet him at an appointed place, where \nthey received him with joyful shouts and tears, as the monarch whom \nmany of them had given up for lost or dead, he put himself at their \nhead, marched on the Danish camp, defeated the Danes with great \nslaughter, and besieged them for fourteen days to prevent their \nescape.  But, being as merciful as he was good and brave, he then, \ninstead of killing them, proposed peace:  on condition that they \nshould altogether depart from that Western part of England, and \nsettle in the East; and that GUTHRUM should become a Christian, in \nremembrance of the Divine religion which now taught his conqueror, \nthe noble ALFRED, to forgive the enemy who had so often injured \nhim.  This, GUTHRUM did.  At his baptism, KING ALFRED was his \ngodfather.  And GUTHRUM was an honourable chief who well deserved \nthat clemency; for, ever afterwards he was loyal and faithful to \nthe king.  The Danes under him were faithful too.  They plundered \nand burned no more, but worked like honest men.  They ploughed, and \nsowed, and reaped, and led good honest English lives.  And I hope \nthe children of those Danes played, many a time, with Saxon \nchildren in the sunny fields; and that Danish young men fell in \nlove with Saxon girls, and married them; and that English \ntravellers, benighted at the doors of Danish cottages, often went \nin for shelter until morning; and that Danes and Saxons sat by the \nred fire, friends, talking of KING ALFRED THE GREAT.\n\nAll the Danes were not like these under GUTHRUM; for, after some \nyears, more of them came over, in the old plundering and burning \nway - among them a fierce pirate of the name of HASTINGS, who had \nthe boldness to sail up the Thames to Gravesend, with eighty ships.  \nFor three years, there was a war with these Danes; and there was a \nfamine in the country, too, and a plague, both upon human creatures \nand beasts.  But KING ALFRED, whose mighty heart never failed him, \nbuilt large ships nevertheless, with which to pursue the pirates on \nthe sea; and he encouraged his soldiers, by his brave example, to \nfight valiantly against them on the shore.  At last, he drove them \nall away; and then there was repose in England.\n\nAs great and good in peace, as he was great and good in war, KING \nALFRED never rested from his labours to improve his people.  He \nloved to talk with clever men, and with travellers from foreign \ncountries, and to write down what they told him, for his people to \nread.  He had studied Latin after learning to read English, and now \nanother of his labours was, to translate Latin books into the \nEnglish-Saxon tongue, that his people might be interested, and \nimproved by their contents.  He made just laws, that they might \nlive more happily and freely; he turned away all partial judges, \nthat no wrong might be done them; he was so careful of their \nproperty, and punished robbers so severely, that it was a common \nthing to say that under the great KING ALFRED, garlands of golden \nchains and jewels might have hung across the streets, and no man \nwould have touched one.  He founded schools; he patiently heard \ncauses himself in his Court of Justice; the great desires of his \nheart were, to do right to all his subjects, and to leave England \nbetter, wiser, happier in all ways, than he found it.  His industry \nin these efforts was quite astonishing.  Every day he divided into \ncertain portions, and in each portion devoted himself to a certain \npursuit.  That he might divide his time exactly, he had wax torches \nor candles made, which were all of the same size, were notched \nacross at regular distances, and were always kept burning.  Thus, \nas the candles burnt down, he divided the day into notches, almost \nas accurately as we now divide it into hours upon the clock.  But \nwhen the candles were first invented, it was found that the wind \nand draughts of air, blowing into the palace through the doors and \nwindows, and through the chinks in the walls, caused them to gutter \nand burn unequally.  To prevent this, the King had them put into \ncases formed of wood and white horn.  And these were the first \nlanthorns ever made in England.\n\nAll this time, he was afflicted with a terrible unknown disease, \nwhich caused him violent and frequent pain that nothing could \nrelieve.  He bore it, as he had borne all the troubles of his life, \nlike a brave good man, until he was fifty-three years old; and \nthen, having reigned thirty years, he died.  He died in the year \nnine hundred and one; but, long ago as that is, his fame, and the \nlove and gratitude with which his subjects regarded him, are \nfreshly remembered to the present hour.\n\nIn the next reign, which was the reign of EDWARD, surnamed THE \nELDER, who was chosen in council to succeed, a nephew of KING \nALFRED troubled the country by trying to obtain the throne.  The \nDanes in the East of England took part with this usurper (perhaps \nbecause they had honoured his uncle so much, and honoured him for \nhis uncle\'s sake), and there was hard fighting; but, the King, with \nthe assistance of his sister, gained the day, and reigned in peace \nfor four and twenty years.  He gradually extended his power over \nthe whole of England, and so the Seven Kingdoms were united into \none.\n\nWhen England thus became one kingdom, ruled over by one Saxon king, \nthe Saxons had been settled in the country more than four hundred \nand fifty years.  Great changes had taken place in its customs \nduring that time.  The Saxons were still greedy eaters and great \ndrinkers, and their feasts were often of a noisy and drunken kind; \nbut many new comforts and even elegances had become known, and were \nfast increasing.  Hangings for the walls of rooms, where, in these \nmodern days, we paste up paper, are known to have been sometimes \nmade of silk, ornamented with birds and flowers in needlework.  \nTables and chairs were curiously carved in different woods; were \nsometimes decorated with gold or silver; sometimes even made of \nthose precious metals.  Knives and spoons were used at table; \ngolden ornaments were worn - with silk and cloth, and golden \ntissues and embroideries; dishes were made of gold and silver, \nbrass and bone.  There were varieties of drinking-horns, bedsteads, \nmusical instruments.  A harp was passed round, at a feast, like the \ndrinking-bowl, from guest to guest; and each one usually sang or \nplayed when his turn came.  The weapons of the Saxons were stoutly \nmade, and among them was a terrible iron hammer that gave deadly \nblows, and was long remembered.  The Saxons themselves were a \nhandsome people.  The men were proud of their long fair hair, \nparted on the forehead; their ample beards, their fresh \ncomplexions, and clear eyes.  The beauty of the Saxon women filled \nall England with a new delight and grace.\n\nI have more to tell of the Saxons yet, but I stop to say this now, \nbecause under the GREAT ALFRED, all the best points of the English-\nSaxon character were first encouraged, and in him first shown.  It \nhas been the greatest character among the nations of the earth.  \nWherever the descendants of the Saxon race have gone, have sailed, \nor otherwise made their way, even to the remotest regions of the \nworld, they have been patient, persevering, never to be broken in \nspirit, never to be turned aside from enterprises on which they \nhave resolved.  In Europe, Asia, Africa, America, the whole world \nover; in the desert, in the forest, on the sea; scorched by a \nburning sun, or frozen by ice that never melts; the Saxon blood \nremains unchanged.  Wheresoever that race goes, there, law, and \nindustry, and safety for life and property, and all the great \nresults of steady perseverance, are certain to arise.\n\nI pause to think with admiration, of the noble king who, in his \nsingle person, possessed all the Saxon virtues.  Whom misfortune \ncould not subdue, whom prosperity could not spoil, whose \nperseverance nothing could shake.  Who was hopeful in defeat, and \ngenerous in success.  Who loved justice, freedom, truth, and \nknowledge.  Who, in his care to instruct his people, probably did \nmore to preserve the beautiful old Saxon language, than I can \nimagine.  Without whom, the English tongue in which I tell this \nstory might have wanted half its meaning.  As it is said that his \nspirit still inspires some of our best English laws, so, let you \nand I pray that it may animate our English hearts, at least to this \n- to resolve, when we see any of our fellow-creatures left in \nignorance, that we will do our best, while life is in us, to have \nthem taught; and to tell those rulers whose duty it is to teach \nthem, and who neglect their duty, that they have profited very \nlittle by all the years that have rolled away since the year nine \nhundred and one, and that they are far behind the bright example of \nKING ALFRED THE GREAT.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV - ENGLAND UNDER ATHELSTAN AND THE SIX BOY-KINGS\n\n\n\nATHELSTAN, the son of Edward the Elder, succeeded that king.  He \nreigned only fifteen years; but he remembered the glory of his \ngrandfather, the great Alfred, and governed England well.  He \nreduced the turbulent people of Wales, and obliged them to pay him \na tribute in money, and in cattle, and to send him their best hawks \nand hounds.  He was victorious over the Cornish men, who were not \nyet quite under the Saxon government.  He restored such of the old \nlaws as were good, and had fallen into disuse; made some wise new \nlaws, and took care of the poor and weak.  A strong alliance, made \nagainst him by ANLAF a Danish prince, CONSTANTINE King of the \nScots, and the people of North Wales, he broke and defeated in one \ngreat battle, long famous for the vast numbers slain in it.  After \nthat, he had a quiet reign; the lords and ladies about him had \nleisure to become polite and agreeable; and foreign princes were \nglad (as they have sometimes been since) to come to England on \nvisits to the English court.\n\nWhen Athelstan died, at forty-seven years old, his brother EDMUND, \nwho was only eighteen, became king.  He was the first of six boy-\nkings, as you will presently know.\n\nThey called him the Magnificent, because he showed a taste for \nimprovement and refinement.  But he was beset by the Danes, and had \na short and troubled reign, which came to a troubled end.  One \nnight, when he was feasting in his hall, and had eaten much and \ndrunk deep, he saw, among the company, a noted robber named LEOF, \nwho had been banished from England.  Made very angry by the \nboldness of this man, the King turned to his cup-bearer, and said, \n\'There is a robber sitting at the table yonder, who, for his \ncrimes, is an outlaw in the land - a hunted wolf, whose life any \nman may take, at any time.  Command that robber to depart!\'  \'I \nwill not depart!\' said Leof.  \'No?\' cried the King.  \'No, by the \nLord!\' said Leof.  Upon that the King rose from his seat, and, \nmaking passionately at the robber, and seizing him by his long \nhair, tried to throw him down.  But the robber had a dagger \nunderneath his cloak, and, in the scuffle, stabbed the King to \ndeath.  That done, he set his back against the wall, and fought so \ndesperately, that although he was soon cut to pieces by the King\'s \narmed men, and the wall and pavement were splashed with his blood, \nyet it was not before he had killed and wounded many of them.  You \nmay imagine what rough lives the kings of those times led, when one \nof them could struggle, half drunk, with a public robber in his own \ndining-hall, and be stabbed in presence of the company who ate and \ndrank with him.\n\nThen succeeded the boy-king EDRED, who was weak and sickly in body, \nbut of a strong mind.  And his armies fought the Northmen, the \nDanes, and Norwegians, or the Sea-Kings, as they were called, and \nbeat them for the time.  And, in nine years, Edred died, and passed \naway.\n\nThen came the boy-king EDWY, fifteen years of age; but the real \nking, who had the real power, was a monk named DUNSTAN - a clever \npriest, a little mad, and not a little proud and cruel.\n\nDunstan was then Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, whither the body of \nKing Edmund the Magnificent was carried, to be buried.  While yet a \nboy, he had got out of his bed one night (being then in a fever), \nand walked about Glastonbury Church when it was under repair; and, \nbecause he did not tumble off some scaffolds that were there, and \nbreak his neck, it was reported that he had been shown over the \nbuilding by an angel.  He had also made a harp that was said to \nplay of itself - which it very likely did, as AEolian Harps, which \nare played by the wind, and are understood now, always do.  For \nthese wonders he had been once denounced by his enemies, who were \njealous of his favour with the late King Athelstan, as a magician; \nand he had been waylaid, bound hand and foot, and thrown into a \nmarsh.  But he got out again, somehow, to cause a great deal of \ntrouble yet.\n\nThe priests of those days were, generally, the only scholars.  They \nwere learned in many things.  Having to make their own convents and \nmonasteries on uncultivated grounds that were granted to them by \nthe Crown, it was necessary that they should be good farmers and \ngood gardeners, or their lands would have been too poor to support \nthem.  For the decoration of the chapels where they prayed, and for \nthe comfort of the refectories where they ate and drank, it was \nnecessary that there should be good carpenters, good smiths, good \npainters, among them.  For their greater safety in sickness and \naccident, living alone by themselves in solitary places, it was \nnecessary that they should study the virtues of plants and herbs, \nand should know how to dress cuts, burns, scalds, and bruises, and \nhow to set broken limbs.  Accordingly, they taught themselves, and \none another, a great variety of useful arts; and became skilful in \nagriculture, medicine, surgery, and handicraft.  And when they \nwanted the aid of any little piece of machinery, which would be \nsimple enough now, but was marvellous then, to impose a trick upon \nthe poor peasants, they knew very well how to make it; and DID make \nit many a time and often, I have no doubt.\n\nDunstan, Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, was one of the most sagacious \nof these monks.  He was an ingenious smith, and worked at a forge \nin a little cell.  This cell was made too short to admit of his \nlying at full length when he went to sleep - as if THAT did any \ngood to anybody! - and he used to tell the most extraordinary lies \nabout demons and spirits, who, he said, came there to persecute \nhim.  For instance, he related that one day when he was at work, \nthe devil looked in at the little window, and tried to tempt him to \nlead a life of idle pleasure; whereupon, having his pincers in the \nfire, red hot, he seized the devil by the nose, and put him to such \npain, that his bellowings were heard for miles and miles.  Some \npeople are inclined to think this nonsense a part of Dunstan\'s \nmadness (for his head never quite recovered the fever), but I think \nnot.  I observe that it induced the ignorant people to consider him \na holy man, and that it made him very powerful.  Which was exactly \nwhat he always wanted.\n\nOn the day of the coronation of the handsome boy-king Edwy, it was \nremarked by ODO, Archbishop of Canterbury (who was a Dane by \nbirth), that the King quietly left the coronation feast, while all \nthe company were there.  Odo, much displeased, sent his friend \nDunstan to seek him.  Dunstan finding him in the company of his \nbeautiful young wife ELGIVA, and her mother ETHELGIVA, a good and \nvirtuous lady, not only grossly abused them, but dragged the young \nKing back into the feasting-hall by force.  Some, again, think \nDunstan did this because the young King\'s fair wife was his own \ncousin, and the monks objected to people marrying their own \ncousins; but I believe he did it, because he was an imperious, \naudacious, ill-conditioned priest, who, having loved a young lady \nhimself before he became a sour monk, hated all love now, and \neverything belonging to it.\n\nThe young King was quite old enough to feel this insult.  Dunstan \nhad been Treasurer in the last reign, and he soon charged Dunstan \nwith having taken some of the last king\'s money.  The Glastonbury \nAbbot fled to Belgium (very narrowly escaping some pursuers who \nwere sent to put out his eyes, as you will wish they had, when you \nread what follows), and his abbey was given to priests who were \nmarried; whom he always, both before and afterwards, opposed.  But \nhe quickly conspired with his friend, Odo the Dane, to set up the \nKing\'s young brother, EDGAR, as his rival for the throne; and, not \ncontent with this revenge, he caused the beautiful queen Elgiva, \nthough a lovely girl of only seventeen or eighteen, to be stolen \nfrom one of the Royal Palaces, branded in the cheek with a red-hot \niron, and sold into slavery in Ireland.  But the Irish people \npitied and befriended her; and they said, \'Let us restore the girl-\nqueen to the boy-king, and make the young lovers happy!\' and they \ncured her of her cruel wound, and sent her home as beautiful as \nbefore.  But the villain Dunstan, and that other villain, Odo, \ncaused her to be waylaid at Gloucester as she was joyfully hurrying \nto join her husband, and to be hacked and hewn with swords, and to \nbe barbarously maimed and lamed, and left to die.  When Edwy the \nFair (his people called him so, because he was so young and \nhandsome) heard of her dreadful fate, he died of a broken heart; \nand so the pitiful story of the poor young wife and husband ends!  \nAh!  Better to be two cottagers in these better times, than king \nand queen of England in those bad days, though never so fair!\n\nThen came the boy-king, EDGAR, called the Peaceful, fifteen years \nold.  Dunstan, being still the real king, drove all married priests \nout of the monasteries and abbeys, and replaced them by solitary \nmonks like himself, of the rigid order called the Benedictines.  He \nmade himself Archbishop of Canterbury, for his greater glory; and \nexercised such power over the neighbouring British princes, and so \ncollected them about the King, that once, when the King held his \ncourt at Chester, and went on the river Dee to visit the monastery \nof St. John, the eight oars of his boat were pulled (as the people \nused to delight in relating in stories and songs) by eight crowned \nkings, and steered by the King of England.  As Edgar was very \nobedient to Dunstan and the monks, they took great pains to \nrepresent him as the best of kings.  But he was really profligate, \ndebauched, and vicious.  He once forcibly carried off a young lady \nfrom the convent at Wilton; and Dunstan, pretending to be very much \nshocked, condemned him not to wear his crown upon his head for \nseven years - no great punishment, I dare say, as it can hardly \nhave been a more comfortable ornament to wear, than a stewpan \nwithout a handle.  His marriage with his second wife, ELFRIDA, is \none of the worst events of his reign.  Hearing of the beauty of \nthis lady, he despatched his favourite courtier, ATHELWOLD, to her \nfather\'s castle in Devonshire, to see if she were really as \ncharming as fame reported.  Now, she was so exceedingly beautiful \nthat Athelwold fell in love with her himself, and married her; but \nhe told the King that she was only rich - not handsome.  The King, \nsuspecting the truth when they came home, resolved to pay the \nnewly-married couple a visit; and, suddenly, told Athelwold to \nprepare for his immediate coming.  Athelwold, terrified, confessed \nto his young wife what he had said and done, and implored her to \ndisguise her beauty by some ugly dress or silly manner, that he \nmight be safe from the King\'s anger.  She promised that she would; \nbut she was a proud woman, who would far rather have been a queen \nthan the wife of a courtier.  She dressed herself in her best \ndress, and adorned herself with her richest jewels; and when the \nKing came, presently, he discovered the cheat.  So, he caused his \nfalse friend, Athelwold, to be murdered in a wood, and married his \nwidow, this bad Elfrida.  Six or seven years afterwards, he died; \nand was buried, as if he had been all that the monks said he was, \nin the abbey of Glastonbury, which he - or Dunstan for him - had \nmuch enriched.\n\nEngland, in one part of this reign, was so troubled by wolves, \nwhich, driven out of the open country, hid themselves in the \nmountains of Wales when they were not attacking travellers and \nanimals, that the tribute payable by the Welsh people was forgiven \nthem, on condition of their producing, every year, three hundred \nwolves\' heads.  And the Welshmen were so sharp upon the wolves, to \nsave their money, that in four years there was not a wolf left.\n\nThen came the boy-king, EDWARD, called the Martyr, from the manner \nof his death.  Elfrida had a son, named ETHELRED, for whom she \nclaimed the throne; but Dunstan did not choose to favour him, and \nhe made Edward king.  The boy was hunting, one day, down in \nDorsetshire, when he rode near to Corfe Castle, where Elfrida and \nEthelred lived.  Wishing to see them kindly, he rode away from his \nattendants and galloped to the castle gate, where he arrived at \ntwilight, and blew his hunting-horn.  \'You are welcome, dear King,\' \nsaid Elfrida, coming out, with her brightest smiles.  \'Pray you \ndismount and enter.\'  \'Not so, dear madam,\' said the King.  \'My \ncompany will miss me, and fear that I have met with some harm.  \nPlease you to give me a cup of wine, that I may drink here, in the \nsaddle, to you and to my little brother, and so ride away with the \ngood speed I have made in riding here.\'  Elfrida, going in to bring \nthe wine, whispered an armed servant, one of her attendants, who \nstole out of the darkening gateway, and crept round behind the \nKing\'s horse.  As the King raised the cup to his lips, saying, \n\'Health!\' to the wicked woman who was smiling on him, and to his \ninnocent brother whose hand she held in hers, and who was only ten \nyears old, this armed man made a spring and stabbed him in the \nback.  He dropped the cup and spurred his horse away; but, soon \nfainting with loss of blood, dropped from the saddle, and, in his \nfall, entangled one of his feet in the stirrup.  The frightened \nhorse dashed on; trailing his rider\'s curls upon the ground; \ndragging his smooth young face through ruts, and stones, and \nbriers, and fallen leaves, and mud; until the hunters, tracking the \nanimal\'s course by the King\'s blood, caught his bridle, and \nreleased the disfigured body.\n\nThen came the sixth and last of the boy-kings, ETHELRED, whom \nElfrida, when he cried out at the sight of his murdered brother \nriding away from the castle gate, unmercifully beat with a torch \nwhich she snatched from one of the attendants.  The people so \ndisliked this boy, on account of his cruel mother and the murder \nshe had done to promote him, that Dunstan would not have had him \nfor king, but would have made EDGITHA, the daughter of the dead \nKing Edgar, and of the lady whom he stole out of the convent at \nWilton, Queen of England, if she would have consented.  But she \nknew the stories of the youthful kings too well, and would not be \npersuaded from the convent where she lived in peace; so, Dunstan \nput Ethelred on the throne, having no one else to put there, and \ngave him the nickname of THE UNREADY - knowing that he wanted \nresolution and firmness.\n\nAt first, Elfrida possessed great influence over the young King, \nbut, as he grew older and came of age, her influence declined.  The \ninfamous woman, not having it in her power to do any more evil, \nthen retired from court, and, according, to the fashion of the \ntime, built churches and monasteries, to expiate her guilt.  As if \na church, with a steeple reaching to the very stars, would have \nbeen any sign of true repentance for the blood of the poor boy, \nwhose murdered form was trailed at his horse\'s heels!  As if she \ncould have buried her wickedness beneath the senseless stones of \nthe whole world, piled up one upon another, for the monks to live \nin!\n\nAbout the ninth or tenth year of this reign, Dunstan died.  He was \ngrowing old then, but was as stern and artful as ever.  Two \ncircumstances that happened in connexion with him, in this reign of \nEthelred, made a great noise.  Once, he was present at a meeting of \nthe Church, when the question was discussed whether priests should \nhave permission to marry; and, as he sat with his head hung down, \napparently thinking about it, a voice seemed to come out of a \ncrucifix in the room, and warn the meeting to be of his opinion.  \nThis was some juggling of Dunstan\'s, and was probably his own voice \ndisguised.  But he played off a worse juggle than that, soon \nafterwards; for, another meeting being held on the same subject, \nand he and his supporters being seated on one side of a great room, \nand their opponents on the other, he rose and said, \'To Christ \nhimself, as judge, do I commit this cause!\'  Immediately on these \nwords being spoken, the floor where the opposite party sat gave \nway, and some were killed and many wounded.  You may be pretty sure \nthat it had been weakened under Dunstan\'s direction, and that it \nfell at Dunstan\'s signal.  HIS part of the floor did not go down.  \nNo, no.  He was too good a workman for that.\n\nWhen he died, the monks settled that he was a Saint, and called him \nSaint Dunstan ever afterwards.  They might just as well have \nsettled that he was a coach-horse, and could just as easily have \ncalled him one.\n\nEthelred the Unready was glad enough, I dare say, to be rid of this \nholy saint; but, left to himself, he was a poor weak king, and his \nreign was a reign of defeat and shame.  The restless Danes, led by \nSWEYN, a son of the King of Denmark who had quarrelled with his \nfather and had been banished from home, again came into England, \nand, year after year, attacked and despoiled large towns.  To coax \nthese sea-kings away, the weak Ethelred paid them money; but, the \nmore money he paid, the more money the Danes wanted.  At first, he \ngave them ten thousand pounds; on their next invasion, sixteen \nthousand pounds; on their next invasion, four and twenty thousand \npounds:  to pay which large sums, the unfortunate English people \nwere heavily taxed.  But, as the Danes still came back and wanted \nmore, he thought it would be a good plan to marry into some \npowerful foreign family that would help him with soldiers.  So, in \nthe year one thousand and two, he courted and married Emma, the \nsister of Richard Duke of Normandy; a lady who was called the \nFlower of Normandy.\n\nAnd now, a terrible deed was done in England, the like of which was \nnever done on English ground before or since.  On the thirteenth of \nNovember, in pursuance of secret instructions sent by the King over \nthe whole country, the inhabitants of every town and city armed, \nand murdered all the Danes who were their neighbours.\n\nYoung and old, babies and soldiers, men and women, every Dane was \nkilled.  No doubt there were among them many ferocious men who had \ndone the English great wrong, and whose pride and insolence, in \nswaggering in the houses of the English and insulting their wives \nand daughters, had become unbearable; but no doubt there were also \namong them many peaceful Christian Danes who had married English \nwomen and become like English men.  They were all slain, even to \nGUNHILDA, the sister of the King of Denmark, married to an English \nlord; who was first obliged to see the murder of her husband and \nher child, and then was killed herself.\n\nWhen the King of the sea-kings heard of this deed of blood, he \nswore that he would have a great revenge.  He raised an army, and a \nmightier fleet of ships than ever yet had sailed to England; and in \nall his army there was not a slave or an old man, but every soldier \nwas a free man, and the son of a free man, and in the prime of \nlife, and sworn to be revenged upon the English nation, for the \nmassacre of that dread thirteenth of November, when his countrymen \nand countrywomen, and the little children whom they loved, were \nkilled with fire and sword.  And so, the sea-kings came to England \nin many great ships, each bearing the flag of its own commander.  \nGolden eagles, ravens, dragons, dolphins, beasts of prey, \nthreatened England from the prows of those ships, as they came \nonward through the water; and were reflected in the shining shields \nthat hung upon their sides.  The ship that bore the standard of the \nKing of the sea-kings was carved and painted like a mighty serpent; \nand the King in his anger prayed that the Gods in whom he trusted \nmight all desert him, if his serpent did not strike its fangs into \nEngland\'s heart.\n\nAnd indeed it did.  For, the great army landing from the great \nfleet, near Exeter, went forward, laying England waste, and \nstriking their lances in the earth as they advanced, or throwing \nthem into rivers, in token of their making all the island theirs.  \nIn remembrance of the black November night when the Danes were \nmurdered, wheresoever the invaders came, they made the Saxons \nprepare and spread for them great feasts; and when they had eaten \nthose feasts, and had drunk a curse to England with wild \nrejoicings, they drew their swords, and killed their Saxon \nentertainers, and marched on.  For six long years they carried on \nthis war:  burning the crops, farmhouses, barns, mills, granaries; \nkilling the labourers in the fields; preventing the seed from being \nsown in the ground; causing famine and starvation; leaving only \nheaps of ruin and smoking ashes, where they had found rich towns.  \nTo crown this misery, English officers and men deserted, and even \nthe favourites of Ethelred the Unready, becoming traitors, seized \nmany of the English ships, turned pirates against their own \ncountry, and aided by a storm occasioned the loss of nearly the \nwhole English navy.\n\nThere was but one man of note, at this miserable pass, who was true \nto his country and the feeble King.  He was a priest, and a brave \none.  For twenty days, the Archbishop of Canterbury defended that \ncity against its Danish besiegers; and when a traitor in the town \nthrew the gates open and admitted them, he said, in chains, \'I will \nnot buy my life with money that must be extorted from the suffering \npeople.  Do with me what you please!\'  Again and again, he steadily \nrefused to purchase his release with gold wrung from the poor.\n\nAt last, the Danes being tired of this, and being assembled at a \ndrunken merry-making, had him brought into the feasting-hall.\n\n\'Now, bishop,\' they said, \'we want gold!\'\n\nHe looked round on the crowd of angry faces; from the shaggy beards \nclose to him, to the shaggy beards against the walls, where men \nwere mounted on tables and forms to see him over the heads of \nothers:  and he knew that his time was come.\n\n\'I have no gold,\' he said.\n\n\'Get it, bishop!\' they all thundered.\n\n\'That, I have often told you I will not,\' said he.\n\nThey gathered closer round him, threatening, but he stood unmoved.  \nThen, one man struck him; then, another; then a cursing soldier \npicked up from a heap in a corner of the hall, where fragments had \nbeen rudely thrown at dinner, a great ox-bone, and cast it at his \nface, from which the blood came spurting forth; then, others ran to \nthe same heap, and knocked him down with other bones, and bruised \nand battered him; until one soldier whom he had baptised (willing, \nas I hope for the sake of that soldier\'s soul, to shorten the \nsufferings of the good man) struck him dead with his battle-axe.\n\nIf Ethelred had had the heart to emulate the courage of this noble \narchbishop, he might have done something yet.  But he paid the \nDanes forty-eight thousand pounds, instead, and gained so little by \nthe cowardly act, that Sweyn soon afterwards came over to subdue \nall England.  So broken was the attachment of the English people, \nby this time, to their incapable King and their forlorn country \nwhich could not protect them, that they welcomed Sweyn on all \nsides, as a deliverer.  London faithfully stood out, as long as the \nKing was within its walls; but, when he sneaked away, it also \nwelcomed the Dane.  Then, all was over; and the King took refuge \nabroad with the Duke of Normandy, who had already given shelter to \nthe King\'s wife, once the Flower of that country, and to her \nchildren.\n\nStill, the English people, in spite of their sad sufferings, could \nnot quite forget the great King Alfred and the Saxon race.  When \nSweyn died suddenly, in little more than a month after he had been \nproclaimed King of England, they generously sent to Ethelred, to \nsay that they would have him for their King again, \'if he would \nonly govern them better than he had governed them before.\'  The \nUnready, instead of coming himself, sent Edward, one of his sons, \nto make promises for him.  At last, he followed, and the English \ndeclared him King.  The Danes declared CANUTE, the son of Sweyn, \nKing.  Thus, direful war began again, and lasted for three years, \nwhen the Unready died.  And I know of nothing better that he did, \nin all his reign of eight and thirty years.\n\nWas Canute to be King now?  Not over the Saxons, they said; they \nmust have EDMUND, one of the sons of the Unready, who was surnamed \nIRONSIDE, because of his strength and stature.  Edmund and Canute \nthereupon fell to, and fought five battles - O unhappy England, \nwhat a fighting-ground it was! - and then Ironside, who was a big \nman, proposed to Canute, who was a little man, that they two should \nfight it out in single combat.  If Canute had been the big man, he \nwould probably have said yes, but, being the little man, he \ndecidedly said no.  However, he declared that he was willing to \ndivide the kingdom - to take all that lay north of Watling Street, \nas the old Roman military road from Dover to Chester was called, \nand to give Ironside all that lay south of it.  Most men being \nweary of so much bloodshed, this was done.  But Canute soon became \nsole King of England; for Ironside died suddenly within two months.  \nSome think that he was killed, and killed by Canute\'s orders.  No \none knows.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V - ENGLAND UNDER CANUTE THE DANE\n\n\n\nCANUTE reigned eighteen years.  He was a merciless King at first.  \nAfter he had clasped the hands of the Saxon chiefs, in token of the \nsincerity with which he swore to be just and good to them in return \nfor their acknowledging him, he denounced and slew many of them, as \nwell as many relations of the late King.  \'He who brings me the \nhead of one of my enemies,\' he used to say, \'shall be dearer to me \nthan a brother.\'  And he was so severe in hunting down his enemies, \nthat he must have got together a pretty large family of these dear \nbrothers.  He was strongly inclined to kill EDMUND and EDWARD, two \nchildren, sons of poor Ironside; but, being afraid to do so in \nEngland, he sent them over to the King of Sweden, with a request \nthat the King would be so good as \'dispose of them.\'  If the King \nof Sweden had been like many, many other men of that day, he would \nhave had their innocent throats cut; but he was a kind man, and \nbrought them up tenderly.\n\nNormandy ran much in Canute\'s mind.  In Normandy were the two \nchildren of the late king - EDWARD and ALFRED by name; and their \nuncle the Duke might one day claim the crown for them.  But the \nDuke showed so little inclination to do so now, that he proposed to \nCanute to marry his sister, the widow of The Unready; who, being \nbut a showy flower, and caring for nothing so much as becoming a \nqueen again, left her children and was wedded to him.\n\nSuccessful and triumphant, assisted by the valour of the English in \nhis foreign wars, and with little strife to trouble him at home, \nCanute had a prosperous reign, and made many improvements.  He was \na poet and a musician.  He grew sorry, as he grew older, for the \nblood he had shed at first; and went to Rome in a Pilgrim\'s dress, \nby way of washing it out.  He gave a great deal of money to \nforeigners on his journey; but he took it from the English before \nhe started.  On the whole, however, he certainly became a far \nbetter man when he had no opposition to contend with, and was as \ngreat a King as England had known for some time.\n\nThe old writers of history relate how that Canute was one day \ndisgusted with his courtiers for their flattery, and how he caused \nhis chair to be set on the sea-shore, and feigned to command the \ntide as it came up not to wet the edge of his robe, for the land \nwas his; how the tide came up, of course, without regarding him; \nand how he then turned to his flatterers, and rebuked them, saying, \nwhat was the might of any earthly king, to the might of the \nCreator, who could say unto the sea, \'Thus far shalt thou go, and \nno farther!\'  We may learn from this, I think, that a little sense \nwill go a long way in a king; and that courtiers are not easily \ncured of flattery, nor kings of a liking for it.  If the courtiers \nof Canute had not known, long before, that the King was fond of \nflattery, they would have known better than to offer it in such \nlarge doses.  And if they had not known that he was vain of this \nspeech (anything but a wonderful speech it seems to me, if a good \nchild had made it), they would not have been at such great pains to \nrepeat it.  I fancy I see them all on the sea-shore together; the \nKing\'s chair sinking in the sand; the King in a mighty good humour \nwith his own wisdom; and the courtiers pretending to be quite \nstunned by it!\n\nIt is not the sea alone that is bidden to go \'thus far, and no \nfarther.\'  The great command goes forth to all the kings upon the \nearth, and went to Canute in the year one thousand and thirty-five, \nand stretched him dead upon his bed.  Beside it, stood his Norman \nwife.  Perhaps, as the King looked his last upon her, he, who had \nso often thought distrustfully of Normandy, long ago, thought once \nmore of the two exiled Princes in their uncle\'s court, and of the \nlittle favour they could feel for either Danes or Saxons, and of a \nrising cloud in Normandy that slowly moved towards England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI - ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD HAREFOOT, HARDICANUTE, AND EDWARD \nTHE CONFESSOR\n\n\n\nCANUTE left three sons, by name SWEYN, HAROLD, and HARDICANUTE; but \nhis Queen, Emma, once the Flower of Normandy, was the mother of \nonly Hardicanute.  Canute had wished his dominions to be divided \nbetween the three, and had wished Harold to have England; but the \nSaxon people in the South of England, headed by a nobleman with \ngreat possessions, called the powerful EARL GODWIN (who is said to \nhave been originally a poor cow-boy), opposed this, and desired to \nhave, instead, either Hardicanute, or one of the two exiled Princes \nwho were over in Normandy.  It seemed so certain that there would \nbe more bloodshed to settle this dispute, that many people left \ntheir homes, and took refuge in the woods and swamps.  Happily, \nhowever, it was agreed to refer the whole question to a great \nmeeting at Oxford, which decided that Harold should have all the \ncountry north of the Thames, with London for his capital city, and \nthat Hardicanute should have all the south.  The quarrel was so \narranged; and, as Hardicanute was in Denmark troubling himself very \nlittle about anything but eating and getting drunk, his mother and \nEarl Godwin governed the south for him.\n\nThey had hardly begun to do so, and the trembling people who had \nhidden themselves were scarcely at home again, when Edward, the \nelder of the two exiled Princes, came over from Normandy with a few \nfollowers, to claim the English Crown.  His mother Emma, however, \nwho only cared for her last son Hardicanute, instead of assisting \nhim, as he expected, opposed him so strongly with all her influence \nthat he was very soon glad to get safely back.  His brother Alfred \nwas not so fortunate.  Believing in an affectionate letter, written \nsome time afterwards to him and his brother, in his mother\'s name \n(but whether really with or without his mother\'s knowledge is now \nuncertain), he allowed himself to be tempted over to England, with \na good force of soldiers, and landing on the Kentish coast, and \nbeing met and welcomed by Earl Godwin, proceeded into Surrey, as \nfar as the town of Guildford.  Here, he and his men halted in the \nevening to rest, having still the Earl in their company; who had \nordered lodgings and good cheer for them.  But, in the dead of the \nnight, when they were off their guard, being divided into small \nparties sleeping soundly after a long march and a plentiful supper \nin different houses, they were set upon by the King\'s troops, and \ntaken prisoners.  Next morning they were drawn out in a line, to \nthe number of six hundred men, and were barbarously tortured and \nkilled; with the exception of every tenth man, who was sold into \nslavery.  As to the wretched Prince Alfred, he was stripped naked, \ntied to a horse and sent away into the Isle of Ely, where his eyes \nwere torn out of his head, and where in a few days he miserably \ndied.  I am not sure that the Earl had wilfully entrapped him, but \nI suspect it strongly.\n\nHarold was now King all over England, though it is doubtful whether \nthe Archbishop of Canterbury (the greater part of the priests were \nSaxons, and not friendly to the Danes) ever consented to crown him.  \nCrowned or uncrowned, with the Archbishop\'s leave or without it, he \nwas King for four years:  after which short reign he died, and was \nburied; having never done much in life but go a hunting.  He was \nsuch a fast runner at this, his favourite sport, that the people \ncalled him Harold Harefoot.\n\nHardicanute was then at Bruges, in Flanders, plotting, with his \nmother (who had gone over there after the cruel murder of Prince \nAlfred), for the invasion of England.  The Danes and Saxons, \nfinding themselves without a King, and dreading new disputes, made \ncommon cause, and joined in inviting him to occupy the Throne.  He \nconsented, and soon troubled them enough; for he brought over \nnumbers of Danes, and taxed the people so insupportably to enrich \nthose greedy favourites that there were many insurrections, \nespecially one at Worcester, where the citizens rose and killed his \ntax-collectors; in revenge for which he burned their city.  He was \na brutal King, whose first public act was to order the dead body of \npoor Harold Harefoot to be dug up, beheaded, and thrown into the \nriver.  His end was worthy of such a beginning.  He fell down \ndrunk, with a goblet of wine in his hand, at a wedding-feast at \nLambeth, given in honour of the marriage of his standard-bearer, a \nDane named TOWED THE PROUD.  And he never spoke again.\n\nEDWARD, afterwards called by the monks THE CONFESSOR, succeeded; \nand his first act was to oblige his mother Emma, who had favoured \nhim so little, to retire into the country; where she died some ten \nyears afterwards.  He was the exiled prince whose brother Alfred \nhad been so foully killed.  He had been invited over from Normandy \nby Hardicanute, in the course of his short reign of two years, and \nhad been handsomely treated at court.  His cause was now favoured \nby the powerful Earl Godwin, and he was soon made King.  This Earl \nhad been suspected by the people, ever since Prince Alfred\'s cruel \ndeath; he had even been tried in the last reign for the Prince\'s \nmurder, but had been pronounced not guilty; chiefly, as it was \nsupposed, because of a present he had made to the swinish King, of \na gilded ship with a figure-head of solid gold, and a crew of \neighty splendidly armed men.  It was his interest to help the new \nKing with his power, if the new King would help him against the \npopular distrust and hatred.  So they made a bargain.  Edward the \nConfessor got the Throne.  The Earl got more power and more land, \nand his daughter Editha was made queen; for it was a part of their \ncompact that the King should take her for his wife.\n\nBut, although she was a gentle lady, in all things worthy to be \nbeloved - good, beautiful, sensible, and kind - the King from the \nfirst neglected her.  Her father and her six proud brothers, \nresenting this cold treatment, harassed the King greatly by \nexerting all their power to make him unpopular.  Having lived so \nlong in Normandy, he preferred the Normans to the English.  He made \na Norman Archbishop, and Norman Bishops; his great officers and \nfavourites were all Normans; he introduced the Norman fashions and \nthe Norman language; in imitation of the state custom of Normandy, \nhe attached a great seal to his state documents, instead of merely \nmarking them, as the Saxon Kings had done, with the sign of the \ncross - just as poor people who have never been taught to write, \nnow make the same mark for their names.  All this, the powerful \nEarl Godwin and his six proud sons represented to the people as \ndisfavour shown towards the English; and thus they daily increased \ntheir own power, and daily diminished the power of the King.\n\nThey were greatly helped by an event that occurred when he had \nreigned eight years.  Eustace, Earl of Bologne, who had married the \nKing\'s sister, came to England on a visit.  After staying at the \ncourt some time, he set forth, with his numerous train of \nattendants, to return home.  They were to embark at Dover.  \nEntering that peaceful town in armour, they took possession of the \nbest houses, and noisily demanded to be lodged and entertained \nwithout payment.  One of the bold men of Dover, who would not \nendure to have these domineering strangers jingling their heavy \nswords and iron corselets up and down his house, eating his meat \nand drinking his strong liquor, stood in his doorway and refused \nadmission to the first armed man who came there.  The armed man \ndrew, and wounded him.  The man of Dover struck the armed man dead.  \nIntelligence of what he had done, spreading through the streets to \nwhere the Count Eustace and his men were standing by their horses, \nbridle in hand, they passionately mounted, galloped to the house, \nsurrounded it, forced their way in (the doors and windows being \nclosed when they came up), and killed the man of Dover at his own \nfireside.  They then clattered through the streets, cutting down \nand riding over men, women, and children.  This did not last long, \nyou may believe.  The men of Dover set upon them with great fury, \nkilled nineteen of the foreigners, wounded many more, and, \nblockading the road to the port so that they should not embark, \nbeat them out of the town by the way they had come.  Hereupon, \nCount Eustace rides as hard as man can ride to Gloucester, where \nEdward is, surrounded by Norman monks and Norman lords.  \'Justice!\' \ncries the Count, \'upon the men of Dover, who have set upon and \nslain my people!\'  The King sends immediately for the powerful Earl \nGodwin, who happens to be near; reminds him that Dover is under his \ngovernment; and orders him to repair to Dover and do military \nexecution on the inhabitants.  \'It does not become you,\' says the \nproud Earl in reply, \'to condemn without a hearing those whom you \nhave sworn to protect.  I will not do it.\'\n\nThe King, therefore, summoned the Earl, on pain of banishment and \nloss of his titles and property, to appear before the court to \nanswer this disobedience.  The Earl refused to appear.  He, his \neldest son Harold, and his second son Sweyn, hastily raised as many \nfighting men as their utmost power could collect, and demanded to \nhave Count Eustace and his followers surrendered to the justice of \nthe country.  The King, in his turn, refused to give them up, and \nraised a strong force.  After some treaty and delay, the troops of \nthe great Earl and his sons began to fall off.  The Earl, with a \npart of his family and abundance of treasure, sailed to Flanders; \nHarold escaped to Ireland; and the power of the great family was \nfor that time gone in England.  But, the people did not forget \nthem.\n\nThen, Edward the Confessor, with the true meanness of a mean \nspirit, visited his dislike of the once powerful father and sons \nupon the helpless daughter and sister, his unoffending wife, whom \nall who saw her (her husband and his monks excepted) loved.  He \nseized rapaciously upon her fortune and her jewels, and allowing \nher only one attendant, confined her in a gloomy convent, of which \na sister of his - no doubt an unpleasant lady after his own heart - \nwas abbess or jailer.\n\nHaving got Earl Godwin and his six sons well out of his way, the \nKing favoured the Normans more than ever.  He invited over WILLIAM, \nDUKE OF NORMANDY, the son of that Duke who had received him and his \nmurdered brother long ago, and of a peasant girl, a tanner\'s \ndaughter, with whom that Duke had fallen in love for her beauty as \nhe saw her washing clothes in a brook.  William, who was a great \nwarrior, with a passion for fine horses, dogs, and arms, accepted \nthe invitation; and the Normans in England, finding themselves more \nnumerous than ever when he arrived with his retinue, and held in \nstill greater honour at court than before, became more and more \nhaughty towards the people, and were more and more disliked by \nthem.\n\nThe old Earl Godwin, though he was abroad, knew well how the people \nfelt; for, with part of the treasure he had carried away with him, \nhe kept spies and agents in his pay all over England.\n\nAccordingly, he thought the time was come for fitting out a great \nexpedition against the Norman-loving King.  With it, he sailed to \nthe Isle of Wight, where he was joined by his son Harold, the most \ngallant and brave of all his family.  And so the father and son \ncame sailing up the Thames to Southwark; great numbers of the \npeople declaring for them, and shouting for the English Earl and \nthe English Harold, against the Norman favourites!\n\nThe King was at first as blind and stubborn as kings usually have \nbeen whensoever they have been in the hands of monks.  But the \npeople rallied so thickly round the old Earl and his son, and the \nold Earl was so steady in demanding without bloodshed the \nrestoration of himself and his family to their rights, that at last \nthe court took the alarm.  The Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, and \nthe Norman Bishop of London, surrounded by their retainers, fought \ntheir way out of London, and escaped from Essex to France in a \nfishing-boat.  The other Norman favourites dispersed in all \ndirections.  The old Earl and his sons (except Sweyn, who had \ncommitted crimes against the law) were restored to their \npossessions and dignities.  Editha, the virtuous and lovely Queen \nof the insensible King, was triumphantly released from her prison, \nthe convent, and once more sat in her chair of state, arrayed in \nthe jewels of which, when she had no champion to support her \nrights, her cold-blooded husband had deprived her.\n\nThe old Earl Godwin did not long enjoy his restored fortune.  He \nfell down in a fit at the King\'s table, and died upon the third day \nafterwards.  Harold succeeded to his power, and to a far higher \nplace in the attachment of the people than his father had ever \nheld.  By his valour he subdued the King\'s enemies in many bloody \nfights.  He was vigorous against rebels in Scotland - this was the \ntime when Macbeth slew Duncan, upon which event our English \nShakespeare, hundreds of years afterwards, wrote his great tragedy; \nand he killed the restless Welsh King GRIFFITH, and brought his \nhead to England.\n\nWhat Harold was doing at sea, when he was driven on the French \ncoast by a tempest, is not at all certain; nor does it at all \nmatter.  That his ship was forced by a storm on that shore, and \nthat he was taken prisoner, there is no doubt.  In those barbarous \ndays, all shipwrecked strangers were taken prisoners, and obliged \nto pay ransom.  So, a certain Count Guy, who was the Lord of \nPonthieu where Harold\'s disaster happened, seized him, instead of \nrelieving him like a hospitable and Christian lord as he ought to \nhave done, and expected to make a very good thing of it.\n\nBut Harold sent off immediately to Duke William of Normandy, \ncomplaining of this treatment; and the Duke no sooner heard of it \nthan he ordered Harold to be escorted to the ancient town of Rouen, \nwhere he then was, and where he received him as an honoured guest.  \nNow, some writers tell us that Edward the Confessor, who was by \nthis time old and had no children, had made a will, appointing Duke \nWilliam of Normandy his successor, and had informed the Duke of his \nhaving done so.  There is no doubt that he was anxious about his \nsuccessor; because he had even invited over, from abroad, EDWARD \nTHE OUTLAW, a son of Ironside, who had come to England with his \nwife and three children, but whom the King had strangely refused to \nsee when he did come, and who had died in London suddenly (princes \nwere terribly liable to sudden death in those days), and had been \nburied in St. Paul\'s Cathedral.  The King might possibly have made \nsuch a will; or, having always been fond of the Normans, he might \nhave encouraged Norman William to aspire to the English crown, by \nsomething that he said to him when he was staying at the English \ncourt.  But, certainly William did now aspire to it; and knowing \nthat Harold would be a powerful rival, he called together a great \nassembly of his nobles, offered Harold his daughter ADELE in \nmarriage, informed him that he meant on King Edward\'s death to \nclaim the English crown as his own inheritance, and required Harold \nthen and there to swear to aid him.  Harold, being in the Duke\'s \npower, took this oath upon the Missal, or Prayer-book.  It is a \ngood example of the superstitions of the monks, that this Missal, \ninstead of being placed upon a table, was placed upon a tub; which, \nwhen Harold had sworn, was uncovered, and shown to be full of dead \nmen\'s bones - bones, as the monks pretended, of saints.  This was \nsupposed to make Harold\'s oath a great deal more impressive and \nbinding.  As if the great name of the Creator of Heaven and earth \ncould be made more solemn by a knuckle-bone, or a double-tooth, or \na finger-nail, of Dunstan!\n\nWithin a week or two after Harold\'s return to England, the dreary \nold Confessor was found to be dying.  After wandering in his mind \nlike a very weak old man, he died.  As he had put himself entirely \nin the hands of the monks when he was alive, they praised him \nlustily when he was dead.  They had gone so far, already, as to \npersuade him that he could work miracles; and had brought people \nafflicted with a bad disorder of the skin, to him, to be touched \nand cured.  This was called \'touching for the King\'s Evil,\' which \nafterwards became a royal custom.  You know, however, Who really \ntouched the sick, and healed them; and you know His sacred name is \nnot among the dusty line of human kings.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII - ENGLAND UNDER HAROLD THE SECOND, AND CONQUERED BY THE \nNORMANS\n\n\n\nHAROLD was crowned King of England on the very day of the maudlin \nConfessor\'s funeral.  He had good need to be quick about it.  When \nthe news reached Norman William, hunting in his park at Rouen, he \ndropped his bow, returned to his palace, called his nobles to \ncouncil, and presently sent ambassadors to Harold, calling on him \nto keep his oath and resign the Crown.  Harold would do no such \nthing.  The barons of France leagued together round Duke William \nfor the invasion of England.  Duke William promised freely to \ndistribute English wealth and English lands among them.  The Pope \nsent to Normandy a consecrated banner, and a ring containing a hair \nwhich he warranted to have grown on the head of Saint Peter.  He \nblessed the enterprise; and cursed Harold; and requested that the \nNormans would pay \'Peter\'s Pence\' - or a tax to himself of a penny \na year on every house - a little more regularly in future, if they \ncould make it convenient.\n\nKing Harold had a rebel brother in Flanders, who was a vassal of \nHAROLD HARDRADA, King of Norway.  This brother, and this Norwegian \nKing, joining their forces against England, with Duke William\'s \nhelp, won a fight in which the English were commanded by two \nnobles; and then besieged York.  Harold, who was waiting for the \nNormans on the coast at Hastings, with his army, marched to \nStamford Bridge upon the river Derwent to give them instant battle.\n\nHe found them drawn up in a hollow circle, marked out by their \nshining spears.  Riding round this circle at a distance, to survey \nit, he saw a brave figure on horseback, in a blue mantle and a \nbright helmet, whose horse suddenly stumbled and threw him.\n\n\'Who is that man who has fallen?\' Harold asked of one of his \ncaptains.\n\n\'The King of Norway,\' he replied.\n\n\'He is a tall and stately king,\' said Harold, \'but his end is \nnear.\'\n\nHe added, in a little while, \'Go yonder to my brother, and tell \nhim, if he withdraw his troops, he shall be Earl of Northumberland, \nand rich and powerful in England.\'\n\nThe captain rode away and gave the message.\n\n\'What will he give to my friend the King of Norway?\' asked the \nbrother.\n\n\'Seven feet of earth for a grave,\' replied the captain.\n\n\'No more?\' returned the brother, with a smile.\n\n\'The King of Norway being a tall man, perhaps a little more,\' \nreplied the captain.\n\n\'Ride back!\' said the brother, \'and tell King Harold to make ready \nfor the fight!\'\n\nHe did so, very soon.  And such a fight King Harold led against \nthat force, that his brother, and the Norwegian King, and every \nchief of note in all their host, except the Norwegian King\'s son, \nOlave, to whom he gave honourable dismissal, were left dead upon \nthe field.  The victorious army marched to York.  As King Harold \nsat there at the feast, in the midst of all his company, a stir was \nheard at the doors; and messengers all covered with mire from \nriding far and fast through broken ground came hurrying in, to \nreport that the Normans had landed in England.\n\nThe intelligence was true.  They had been tossed about by contrary \nwinds, and some of their ships had been wrecked.  A part of their \nown shore, to which they had been driven back, was strewn with \nNorman bodies.  But they had once more made sail, led by the Duke\'s \nown galley, a present from his wife, upon the prow whereof the \nfigure of a golden boy stood pointing towards England.  By day, the \nbanner of the three Lions of Normandy, the diverse coloured sails, \nthe gilded vans, the many decorations of this gorgeous ship, had \nglittered in the sun and sunny water; by night, a light had \nsparkled like a star at her mast-head.  And now, encamped near \nHastings, with their leader lying in the old Roman castle of \nPevensey, the English retiring in all directions, the land for \nmiles around scorched and smoking, fired and pillaged, was the \nwhole Norman power, hopeful and strong on English ground.\n\nHarold broke up the feast and hurried to London.  Within a week, \nhis army was ready.  He sent out spies to ascertain the Norman \nstrength.  William took them, caused them to be led through his \nwhole camp, and then dismissed.  \'The Normans,\' said these spies to \nHarold, \'are not bearded on the upper lip as we English are, but \nare shorn.  They are priests.\'  \'My men,\' replied Harold, with a \nlaugh, \'will find those priests good soldiers!\'\n\n\'The Saxons,\' reported Duke William\'s outposts of Norman soldiers, \nwho were instructed to retire as King Harold\'s army advanced, \'rush \non us through their pillaged country with the fury of madmen.\'\n\n\'Let them come, and come soon!\' said Duke William.\n\nSome proposals for a reconciliation were made, but were soon \nabandoned.  In the middle of the month of October, in the year one \nthousand and sixty-six, the Normans and the English came front to \nfront.  All night the armies lay encamped before each other, in a \npart of the country then called Senlac, now called (in remembrance \nof them) Battle.  With the first dawn of day, they arose.  There, \nin the faint light, were the English on a hill; a wood behind them; \nin their midst, the Royal banner, representing a fighting warrior, \nwoven in gold thread, adorned with precious stones; beneath the \nbanner, as it rustled in the wind, stood King Harold on foot, with \ntwo of his remaining brothers by his side; around them, still and \nsilent as the dead, clustered the whole English army - every \nsoldier covered by his shield, and bearing in his hand his dreaded \nEnglish battle-axe.\n\nOn an opposite hill, in three lines, archers, foot-soldiers, \nhorsemen, was the Norman force.  Of a sudden, a great battle-cry, \n\'God help us!\' burst from the Norman lines.  The English answered \nwith their own battle-cry, \'God\'s Rood!  Holy Rood!\'  The Normans \nthen came sweeping down the hill to attack the English.\n\nThere was one tall Norman Knight who rode before the Norman army on \na prancing horse, throwing up his heavy sword and catching it, and \nsinging of the bravery of his countrymen.  An English Knight, who \nrode out from the English force to meet him, fell by this Knight\'s \nhand.  Another English Knight rode out, and he fell too.  But then \na third rode out, and killed the Norman.  This was in the first \nbeginning of the fight.  It soon raged everywhere.\n\nThe English, keeping side by side in a great mass, cared no more \nfor the showers of Norman arrows than if they had been showers of \nNorman rain.  When the Norman horsemen rode against them, with \ntheir battle-axes they cut men and horses down.  The Normans gave \nway.  The English pressed forward.  A cry went forth among the \nNorman troops that Duke William was killed.  Duke William took off \nhis helmet, in order that his face might be distinctly seen, and \nrode along the line before his men.  This gave them courage.  As \nthey turned again to face the English, some of their Norman horse \ndivided the pursuing body of the English from the rest, and thus \nall that foremost portion of the English army fell, fighting \nbravely.  The main body still remaining firm, heedless of the \nNorman arrows, and with their battle-axes cutting down the crowds \nof horsemen when they rode up, like forests of young trees, Duke \nWilliam pretended to retreat.  The eager English followed.  The \nNorman army closed again, and fell upon them with great slaughter.\n\n\'Still,\' said Duke William, \'there are thousands of the English, \nfirms as rocks around their King.  Shoot upward, Norman archers, \nthat your arrows may fall down upon their faces!\'\n\nThe sun rose high, and sank, and the battle still raged.  Through \nall the wild October day, the clash and din resounded in the air.  \nIn the red sunset, and in the white moonlight, heaps upon heaps of \ndead men lay strewn, a dreadful spectacle, all over the ground.\n\nKing Harold, wounded with an arrow in the eye, was nearly blind.  \nHis brothers were already killed.  Twenty Norman Knights, whose \nbattered armour had flashed fiery and golden in the sunshine all \nday long, and now looked silvery in the moonlight, dashed forward \nto seize the Royal banner from the English Knights and soldiers, \nstill faithfully collected round their blinded King.  The King \nreceived a mortal wound, and dropped.  The English broke and fled.  \nThe Normans rallied, and the day was lost.\n\nO what a sight beneath the moon and stars, when lights were shining \nin the tent of the victorious Duke William, which was pitched near \nthe spot where Harold fell - and he and his knights were carousing, \nwithin - and soldiers with torches, going slowly to and fro, \nwithout, sought for the corpse of Harold among piles of dead - and \nthe Warrior, worked in golden thread and precious stones, lay low, \nall torn and soiled with blood - and the three Norman Lions kept \nwatch over the field!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII - ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE FIRST, THE NORMAN \nCONQUEROR\n\n\n\nUPON the ground where the brave Harold fell, William the Norman \nafterwards founded an abbey, which, under the name of Battle Abbey, \nwas a rich and splendid place through many a troubled year, though \nnow it is a grey ruin overgrown with ivy.  But the first work he \nhad to do, was to conquer the English thoroughly; and that, as you \nknow by this time, was hard work for any man.\n\nHe ravaged several counties; he burned and plundered many towns; he \nlaid waste scores upon scores of miles of pleasant country; he \ndestroyed innumerable lives.  At length STIGAND, Archbishop of \nCanterbury, with other representatives of the clergy and the \npeople, went to his camp, and submitted to him.  EDGAR, the \ninsignificant son of Edmund Ironside, was proclaimed King by \nothers, but nothing came of it.  He fled to Scotland afterwards, \nwhere his sister, who was young and beautiful, married the Scottish \nKing.  Edgar himself was not important enough for anybody to care \nmuch about him.\n\nOn Christmas Day, William was crowned in Westminster Abbey, under \nthe title of WILLIAM THE FIRST; but he is best known as WILLIAM THE \nCONQUEROR.  It was a strange coronation.  One of the bishops who \nperformed the ceremony asked the Normans, in French, if they would \nhave Duke William for their king?  They answered Yes.  Another of \nthe bishops put the same question to the Saxons, in English.  They \ntoo answered Yes, with a loud shout.  The noise being heard by a \nguard of Norman horse-soldiers outside, was mistaken for resistance \non the part of the English.  The guard instantly set fire to the \nneighbouring houses, and a tumult ensued; in the midst of which the \nKing, being left alone in the Abbey, with a few priests (and they \nall being in a terrible fright together), was hurriedly crowned.  \nWhen the crown was placed upon his head, he swore to govern the \nEnglish as well as the best of their own monarchs.  I dare say you \nthink, as I do, that if we except the Great Alfred, he might pretty \neasily have done that.\n\nNumbers of the English nobles had been killed in the last \ndisastrous battle.  Their estates, and the estates of all the \nnobles who had fought against him there, King William seized upon, \nand gave to his own Norman knights and nobles.  Many great English \nfamilies of the present time acquired their English lands in this \nway, and are very proud of it.\n\nBut what is got by force must be maintained by force.  These nobles \nwere obliged to build castles all over England, to defend their new \nproperty; and, do what he would, the King could neither soothe nor \nquell the nation as he wished.  He gradually introduced the Norman \nlanguage and the Norman customs; yet, for a long time the great \nbody of the English remained sullen and revengeful.  On his going \nover to Normandy, to visit his subjects there, the oppressions of \nhis half-brother ODO, whom he left in charge of his English \nkingdom, drove the people mad.  The men of Kent even invited over, \nto take possession of Dover, their old enemy Count Eustace of \nBoulogne, who had led the fray when the Dover man was slain at his \nown fireside.  The men of Hereford, aided by the Welsh, and \ncommanded by a chief named EDRIC THE WILD, drove the Normans out of \ntheir country.  Some of those who had been dispossessed of their \nlands, banded together in the North of England; some, in Scotland; \nsome, in the thick woods and marshes; and whensoever they could \nfall upon the Normans, or upon the English who had submitted to the \nNormans, they fought, despoiled, and murdered, like the desperate \noutlaws that they were.  Conspiracies were set on foot for a \ngeneral massacre of the Normans, like the old massacre of the \nDanes.  In short, the English were in a murderous mood all through \nthe kingdom.\n\nKing William, fearing he might lose his conquest, came back, and \ntried to pacify the London people by soft words.  He then set forth \nto repress the country people by stern deeds.  Among the towns \nwhich he besieged, and where he killed and maimed the inhabitants \nwithout any distinction, sparing none, young or old, armed or \nunarmed, were Oxford, Warwick, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, \nLincoln, York.  In all these places, and in many others, fire and \nsword worked their utmost horrors, and made the land dreadful to \nbehold.  The streams and rivers were discoloured with blood; the \nsky was blackened with smoke; the fields were wastes of ashes; the \nwaysides were heaped up with dead.  Such are the fatal results of \nconquest and ambition!  Although William was a harsh and angry man, \nI do not suppose that he deliberately meant to work this shocking \nruin, when he invaded England.  But what he had got by the strong \nhand, he could only keep by the strong hand, and in so doing he \nmade England a great grave.\n\nTwo sons of Harold, by name EDMUND and GODWIN, came over from \nIreland, with some ships, against the Normans, but were defeated.  \nThis was scarcely done, when the outlaws in the woods so harassed \nYork, that the Governor sent to the King for help.  The King \ndespatched a general and a large force to occupy the town of \nDurham.  The Bishop of that place met the general outside the town, \nand warned him not to enter, as he would be in danger there.  The \ngeneral cared nothing for the warning, and went in with all his \nmen.  That night, on every hill within sight of Durham, signal \nfires were seen to blaze.  When the morning dawned, the English, \nwho had assembled in great strength, forced the gates, rushed into \nthe town, and slew the Normans every one.  The English afterwards \nbesought the Danes to come and help them.  The Danes came, with two \nhundred and forty ships.  The outlawed nobles joined them; they \ncaptured York, and drove the Normans out of that city.  Then, \nWilliam bribed the Danes to go away; and took such vengeance on the \nEnglish, that all the former fire and sword, smoke and ashes, death \nand ruin, were nothing compared with it.  In melancholy songs, and \ndoleful stories, it was still sung and told by cottage fires on \nwinter evenings, a hundred years afterwards, how, in those dreadful \ndays of the Normans, there was not, from the River Humber to the \nRiver Tyne, one inhabited village left, nor one cultivated field - \nhow there was nothing but a dismal ruin, where the human creatures \nand the beasts lay dead together.\n\nThe outlaws had, at this time, what they called a Camp of Refuge, \nin the midst of the fens of Cambridgeshire.  Protected by those \nmarshy grounds which were difficult of approach, they lay among the \nreeds and rushes, and were hidden by the mists that rose up from \nthe watery earth.  Now, there also was, at that time, over the sea \nin Flanders, an Englishman named HEREWARD, whose father had died in \nhis absence, and whose property had been given to a Norman.  When \nhe heard of this wrong that had been done him (from such of the \nexiled English as chanced to wander into that country), he longed \nfor revenge; and joining the outlaws in their camp of refuge, \nbecame their commander.  He was so good a soldier, that the Normans \nsupposed him to be aided by enchantment.  William, even after he \nhad made a road three miles in length across the Cambridgeshire \nmarshes, on purpose to attack this supposed enchanter, thought it \nnecessary to engage an old lady, who pretended to be a sorceress, \nto come and do a little enchantment in the royal cause.  For this \npurpose she was pushed on before the troops in a wooden tower; but \nHereward very soon disposed of this unfortunate sorceress, by \nburning her, tower and all.  The monks of the convent of Ely near \nat hand, however, who were fond of good living, and who found it \nvery uncomfortable to have the country blockaded and their supplies \nof meat and drink cut off, showed the King a secret way of \nsurprising the camp.  So Hereward was soon defeated.  Whether he \nafterwards died quietly, or whether he was killed after killing \nsixteen of the men who attacked him (as some old rhymes relate that \nhe did), I cannot say.  His defeat put an end to the Camp of \nRefuge; and, very soon afterwards, the King, victorious both in \nScotland and in England, quelled the last rebellious English noble.  \nHe then surrounded himself with Norman lords, enriched by the \nproperty of English nobles; had a great survey made of all the land \nin England, which was entered as the property of its new owners, on \na roll called Doomsday Book; obliged the people to put out their \nfires and candles at a certain hour every night, on the ringing of \na bell which was called The Curfew; introduced the Norman dresses \nand manners; made the Normans masters everywhere, and the English, \nservants; turned out the English bishops, and put Normans in their \nplaces; and showed himself to be the Conqueror indeed.\n\nBut, even with his own Normans, he had a restless life.  They were \nalways hungering and thirsting for the riches of the English; and \nthe more he gave, the more they wanted.  His priests were as greedy \nas his soldiers.  We know of only one Norman who plainly told his \nmaster, the King, that he had come with him to England to do his \nduty as a faithful servant, and that property taken by force from \nother men had no charms for him.  His name was GUILBERT.  We should \nnot forget his name, for it is good to remember and to honour \nhonest men.\n\nBesides all these troubles, William the Conqueror was troubled by \nquarrels among his sons.  He had three living.  ROBERT, called \nCURTHOSE, because of his short legs; WILLIAM, called RUFUS or the \nRed, from the colour of his hair; and HENRY, fond of learning, and \ncalled, in the Norman language, BEAUCLERC, or Fine-Scholar.  When \nRobert grew up, he asked of his father the government of Normandy, \nwhich he had nominally possessed, as a child, under his mother, \nMATILDA.  The King refusing to grant it, Robert became jealous and \ndiscontented; and happening one day, while in this temper, to be \nridiculed by his brothers, who threw water on him from a balcony as \nhe was walking before the door, he drew his sword, rushed up-\nstairs, and was only prevented by the King himself from putting \nthem to death.  That same night, he hotly departed with some \nfollowers from his father\'s court, and endeavoured to take the \nCastle of Rouen by surprise.  Failing in this, he shut himself up \nin another Castle in Normandy, which the King besieged, and where \nRobert one day unhorsed and nearly killed him without knowing who \nhe was.  His submission when he discovered his father, and the \nintercession of the queen and others, reconciled them; but not \nsoundly; for Robert soon strayed abroad, and went from court to \ncourt with his complaints.  He was a gay, careless, thoughtless \nfellow, spending all he got on musicians and dancers; but his \nmother loved him, and often, against the King\'s command, supplied \nhim with money through a messenger named SAMSON.  At length the \nincensed King swore he would tear out Samson\'s eyes; and Samson, \nthinking that his only hope of safety was in becoming a monk, \nbecame one, went on such errands no more, and kept his eyes in his \nhead.\n\nAll this time, from the turbulent day of his strange coronation, \nthe Conqueror had been struggling, you see, at any cost of cruelty \nand bloodshed, to maintain what he had seized.  All his reign, he \nstruggled still, with the same object ever before him.  He was a \nstern, bold man, and he succeeded in it.\n\nHe loved money, and was particular in his eating, but he had only \nleisure to indulge one other passion, and that was his love of \nhunting.  He carried it to such a height that he ordered whole \nvillages and towns to be swept away to make forests for the deer.  \nNot satisfied with sixty-eight Royal Forests, he laid waste an \nimmense district, to form another in Hampshire, called the New \nForest.  The many thousands of miserable peasants who saw their \nlittle houses pulled down, and themselves and children turned into \nthe open country without a shelter, detested him for his merciless \naddition to their many sufferings; and when, in the twenty-first \nyear of his reign (which proved to be the last), he went over to \nRouen, England was as full of hatred against him, as if every leaf \non every tree in all his Royal Forests had been a curse upon his \nhead.  In the New Forest, his son Richard (for he had four sons) \nhad been gored to death by a Stag; and the people said that this so \ncruelly-made Forest would yet be fatal to others of the Conqueror\'s \nrace.\n\nHe was engaged in a dispute with the King of France about some \nterritory.  While he stayed at Rouen, negotiating with that King, \nhe kept his bed and took medicines:  being advised by his \nphysicians to do so, on account of having grown to an unwieldy \nsize.  Word being brought to him that the King of France made light \nof this, and joked about it, he swore in a great rage that he \nshould rue his jests.  He assembled his army, marched into the \ndisputed territory, burnt - his old way! - the vines, the crops, \nand fruit, and set the town of Mantes on fire.  But, in an evil \nhour; for, as he rode over the hot ruins, his horse, setting his \nhoofs upon some burning embers, started, threw him forward against \nthe pommel of the saddle, and gave him a mortal hurt.  For six \nweeks he lay dying in a monastery near Rouen, and then made his \nwill, giving England to William, Normandy to Robert, and five \nthousand pounds to Henry.  And now, his violent deeds lay heavy on \nhis mind.  He ordered money to be given to many English churches \nand monasteries, and - which was much better repentance - released \nhis prisoners of state, some of whom had been confined in his \ndungeons twenty years.\n\nIt was a September morning, and the sun was rising, when the King \nwas awakened from slumber by the sound of a church bell.  \'What \nbell is that?\' he faintly asked.  They told him it was the bell of \nthe chapel of Saint Mary.  \'I commend my soul,\' said he, \'to Mary!\' \nand died.\n\nThink of his name, The Conqueror, and then consider how he lay in \ndeath!  The moment he was dead, his physicians, priests, and \nnobles, not knowing what contest for the throne might now take \nplace, or what might happen in it, hastened away, each man for \nhimself and his own property; the mercenary servants of the court \nbegan to rob and plunder; the body of the King, in the indecent \nstrife, was rolled from the bed, and lay alone, for hours, upon the \nground.  O Conqueror, of whom so many great names are proud now, of \nwhom so many great names thought nothing then, it were better to \nhave conquered one true heart, than England!\n\nBy-and-by, the priests came creeping in with prayers and candles; \nand a good knight, named HERLUIN, undertook (which no one else \nwould do) to convey the body to Caen, in Normandy, in order that it \nmight be buried in St. Stephen\'s church there, which the Conqueror \nhad founded.  But fire, of which he had made such bad use in his \nlife, seemed to follow him of itself in death.  A great \nconflagration broke out in the town when the body was placed in the \nchurch; and those present running out to extinguish the flames, it \nwas once again left alone.\n\nIt was not even buried in peace.  It was about to be let down, in \nits Royal robes, into a tomb near the high altar, in presence of a \ngreat concourse of people, when a loud voice in the crowd cried \nout, \'This ground is mine!  Upon it, stood my father\'s house.  This \nKing despoiled me of both ground and house to build this church.  \nIn the great name of GOD, I here forbid his body to be covered with \nthe earth that is my right!\'  The priests and bishops present, \nknowing the speaker\'s right, and knowing that the King had often \ndenied him justice, paid him down sixty shillings for the grave.  \nEven then, the corpse was not at rest.  The tomb was too small, and \nthey tried to force it in.  It broke, a dreadful smell arose, the \npeople hurried out into the air, and, for the third time, it was \nleft alone.\n\nWhere were the Conqueror\'s three sons, that they were not at their \nfather\'s burial?  Robert was lounging among minstrels, dancers, and \ngamesters, in France or Germany.  Henry was carrying his five \nthousand pounds safely away in a convenient chest he had got made.  \nWilliam the Red was hurrying to England, to lay hands upon the \nRoyal treasure and the crown.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX - ENGLAND UNDER WILLIAM THE SECOND, CALLED RUFUS\n\n\n\nWILLIAM THE RED, in breathless haste, secured the three great forts \nof Dover, Pevensey, and Hastings, and made with hot speed for \nWinchester, where the Royal treasure was kept.  The treasurer \ndelivering him the keys, he found that it amounted to sixty \nthousand pounds in silver, besides gold and jewels.  Possessed of \nthis wealth, he soon persuaded the Archbishop of Canterbury to \ncrown him, and became William the Second, King of England.\n\nRufus was no sooner on the throne, than he ordered into prison \nagain the unhappy state captives whom his father had set free, and \ndirected a goldsmith to ornament his father\'s tomb profusely with \ngold and silver.  It would have been more dutiful in him to have \nattended the sick Conqueror when he was dying; but England itself, \nlike this Red King, who once governed it, has sometimes made \nexpensive tombs for dead men whom it treated shabbily when they \nwere alive.\n\nThe King\'s brother, Robert of Normandy, seeming quite content to be \nonly Duke of that country; and the King\'s other brother, Fine-\nScholar, being quiet enough with his five thousand pounds in a \nchest; the King flattered himself, we may suppose, with the hope of \nan easy reign.  But easy reigns were difficult to have in those \ndays.  The turbulent Bishop ODO (who had blessed the Norman army at \nthe Battle of Hastings, and who, I dare say, took all the credit of \nthe victory to himself) soon began, in concert with some powerful \nNorman nobles, to trouble the Red King.\n\nThe truth seems to be that this bishop and his friends, who had \nlands in England and lands in Normandy, wished to hold both under \none Sovereign; and greatly preferred a thoughtless good-natured \nperson, such as Robert was, to Rufus; who, though far from being an \namiable man in any respect, was keen, and not to be imposed upon.  \nThey declared in Robert\'s favour, and retired to their castles \n(those castles were very troublesome to kings) in a sullen humour.  \nThe Red King, seeing the Normans thus falling from him, revenged \nhimself upon them by appealing to the English; to whom he made a \nvariety of promises, which he never meant to perform - in \nparticular, promises to soften the cruelty of the Forest Laws; and \nwho, in return, so aided him with their valour, that ODO was \nbesieged in the Castle of Rochester, and forced to abandon it, and \nto depart from England for ever:  whereupon the other rebellious \nNorman nobles were soon reduced and scattered.\n\nThen, the Red King went over to Normandy, where the people suffered \ngreatly under the loose rule of Duke Robert.  The King\'s object was \nto seize upon the Duke\'s dominions.  This, the Duke, of course, \nprepared to resist; and miserable war between the two brothers \nseemed inevitable, when the powerful nobles on both sides, who had \nseen so much of war, interfered to prevent it.  A treaty was made.  \nEach of the two brothers agreed to give up something of his claims, \nand that the longer-liver of the two should inherit all the \ndominions of the other.  When they had come to this loving \nunderstanding, they embraced and joined their forces against Fine-\nScholar; who had bought some territory of Robert with a part of his \nfive thousand pounds, and was considered a dangerous individual in \nconsequence.\n\nSt. Michael\'s Mount, in Normandy (there is another St. Michael\'s \nMount, in Cornwall, wonderfully like it), was then, as it is now, a \nstrong place perched upon the top of a high rock, around which, \nwhen the tide is in, the sea flows, leaving no road to the \nmainland.  In this place, Fine-Scholar shut himself up with his \nsoldiers, and here he was closely besieged by his two brothers.  At \none time, when he was reduced to great distress for want of water, \nthe generous Robert not only permitted his men to get water, but \nsent Fine-Scholar wine from his own table; and, on being \nremonstrated with by the Red King, said \'What! shall we let our own \nbrother die of thirst?  Where shall we get another, when he is \ngone?\'  At another time, the Red King riding alone on the shore of \nthe bay, looking up at the Castle, was taken by two of Fine-\nScholar\'s men, one of whom was about to kill him, when he cried \nout, \'Hold, knave!  I am the King of England!\'  The story says that \nthe soldier raised him from the ground respectfully and humbly, and \nthat the King took him into his service.  The story may or may not \nbe true; but at any rate it is true that Fine-Scholar could not \nhold out against his united brothers, and that he abandoned Mount \nSt. Michael, and wandered about - as poor and forlorn as other \nscholars have been sometimes known to be.\n\nThe Scotch became unquiet in the Red King\'s time, and were twice \ndefeated - the second time, with the loss of their King, Malcolm, \nand his son.  The Welsh became unquiet too.  Against them, Rufus \nwas less successful; for they fought among their native mountains, \nand did great execution on the King\'s troops.  Robert of Normandy \nbecame unquiet too; and, complaining that his brother the King did \nnot faithfully perform his part of their agreement, took up arms, \nand obtained assistance from the King of France, whom Rufus, in the \nend, bought off with vast sums of money.  England became unquiet \ntoo.  Lord Mowbray, the powerful Earl of Northumberland, headed a \ngreat conspiracy to depose the King, and to place upon the throne, \nSTEPHEN, the Conqueror\'s near relative.  The plot was discovered; \nall the chief conspirators were seized; some were fined, some were \nput in prison, some were put to death.  The Earl of Northumberland \nhimself was shut up in a dungeon beneath Windsor Castle, where he \ndied, an old man, thirty long years afterwards.  The Priests in \nEngland were more unquiet than any other class or power; for the \nRed King treated them with such small ceremony that he refused to \nappoint new bishops or archbishops when the old ones died, but kept \nall the wealth belonging to those offices in his own hands.  In \nreturn for this, the Priests wrote his life when he was dead, and \nabused him well.  I am inclined to think, myself, that there was \nlittle to choose between the Priests and the Red King; that both \nsides were greedy and designing; and that they were fairly matched.\n\nThe Red King was false of heart, selfish, covetous, and mean.  He \nhad a worthy minister in his favourite, Ralph, nicknamed - for \nalmost every famous person had a nickname in those rough days - \nFlambard, or the Firebrand.  Once, the King being ill, became \npenitent, and made ANSELM, a foreign priest and a good man, \nArchbishop of Canterbury.  But he no sooner got well again than he \nrepented of his repentance, and persisted in wrongfully keeping to \nhimself some of the wealth belonging to the archbishopric.  This \nled to violent disputes, which were aggravated by there being in \nRome at that time two rival Popes; each of whom declared he was the \nonly real original infallible Pope, who couldn\'t make a mistake.  \nAt last, Anselm, knowing the Red King\'s character, and not feeling \nhimself safe in England, asked leave to return abroad.  The Red \nKing gladly gave it; for he knew that as soon as Anselm was gone, \nhe could begin to store up all the Canterbury money again, for his \nown use.\n\nBy such means, and by taxing and oppressing the English people in \nevery possible way, the Red King became very rich.  When he wanted \nmoney for any purpose, he raised it by some means or other, and \ncared nothing for the injustice he did, or the misery he caused.  \nHaving the opportunity of buying from Robert the whole duchy of \nNormandy for five years, he taxed the English people more than \never, and made the very convents sell their plate and valuables to \nsupply him with the means to make the purchase.  But he was as \nquick and eager in putting down revolt as he was in raising money; \nfor, a part of the Norman people objecting - very naturally, I \nthink - to being sold in this way, he headed an army against them \nwith all the speed and energy of his father.  He was so impatient, \nthat he embarked for Normandy in a great gale of wind.  And when \nthe sailors told him it was dangerous to go to sea in such angry \nweather, he replied, \'Hoist sail and away!  Did you ever hear of a \nking who was drowned?\'\n\nYou will wonder how it was that even the careless Robert came to \nsell his dominions.  It happened thus.  It had long been the custom \nfor many English people to make journeys to Jerusalem, which were \ncalled pilgrimages, in order that they might pray beside the tomb \nof Our Saviour there.  Jerusalem belonging to the Turks, and the \nTurks hating Christianity, these Christian travellers were often \ninsulted and ill used.  The Pilgrims bore it patiently for some \ntime, but at length a remarkable man, of great earnestness and \neloquence, called PETER THE HERMIT, began to preach in various \nplaces against the Turks, and to declare that it was the duty of \ngood Christians to drive away those unbelievers from the tomb of \nOur Saviour, and to take possession of it, and protect it.  An \nexcitement such as the world had never known before was created.  \nThousands and thousands of men of all ranks and conditions departed \nfor Jerusalem to make war against the Turks.  The war is called in \nhistory the first Crusade, and every Crusader wore a cross marked \non his right shoulder.\n\nAll the Crusaders were not zealous Christians.  Among them were \nvast numbers of the restless, idle, profligate, and adventurous \nspirit of the time.  Some became Crusaders for the love of change; \nsome, in the hope of plunder; some, because they had nothing to do \nat home; some, because they did what the priests told them; some, \nbecause they liked to see foreign countries; some, because they \nwere fond of knocking men about, and would as soon knock a Turk \nabout as a Christian.  Robert of Normandy may have been influenced \nby all these motives; and by a kind desire, besides, to save the \nChristian Pilgrims from bad treatment in future.  He wanted to \nraise a number of armed men, and to go to the Crusade.  He could \nnot do so without money.  He had no money; and he sold his \ndominions to his brother, the Red King, for five years.  With the \nlarge sum he thus obtained, he fitted out his Crusaders gallantly, \nand went away to Jerusalem in martial state.  The Red King, who \nmade money out of everything, stayed at home, busily squeezing more \nmoney out of Normans and English.\n\nAfter three years of great hardship and suffering - from shipwreck \nat sea; from travel in strange lands; from hunger, thirst, and \nfever, upon the burning sands of the desert; and from the fury of \nthe Turks - the valiant Crusaders got possession of Our Saviour\'s \ntomb.  The Turks were still resisting and fighting bravely, but \nthis success increased the general desire in Europe to join the \nCrusade.  Another great French Duke was proposing to sell his \ndominions for a term to the rich Red King, when the Red King\'s \nreign came to a sudden and violent end.\n\nYou have not forgotten the New Forest which the Conqueror made, and \nwhich the miserable people whose homes he had laid waste, so hated.  \nThe cruelty of the Forest Laws, and the torture and death they \nbrought upon the peasantry, increased this hatred.  The poor \npersecuted country people believed that the New Forest was \nenchanted.  They said that in thunder-storms, and on dark nights, \ndemons appeared, moving beneath the branches of the gloomy trees.  \nThey said that a terrible spectre had foretold to Norman hunters \nthat the Red King should be punished there.  And now, in the \npleasant season of May, when the Red King had reigned almost \nthirteen years; and a second Prince of the Conqueror\'s blood - \nanother Richard, the son of Duke Robert - was killed by an arrow in \nthis dreaded Forest; the people said that the second time was not \nthe last, and that there was another death to come.\n\nIt was a lonely forest, accursed in the people\'s hearts for the \nwicked deeds that had been done to make it; and no man save the \nKing and his Courtiers and Huntsmen, liked to stray there.  But, in \nreality, it was like any other forest.  In the spring, the green \nleaves broke out of the buds; in the summer, flourished heartily, \nand made deep shades; in the winter, shrivelled and blew down, and \nlay in brown heaps on the moss.  Some trees were stately, and grew \nhigh and strong; some had fallen of themselves; some were felled by \nthe forester\'s axe; some were hollow, and the rabbits burrowed at \ntheir roots; some few were struck by lightning, and stood white and \nbare.  There were hill-sides covered with rich fern, on which the \nmorning dew so beautifully sparkled; there were brooks, where the \ndeer went down to drink, or over which the whole herd bounded, \nflying from the arrows of the huntsmen; there were sunny glades, \nand solemn places where but little light came through the rustling \nleaves.  The songs of the birds in the New Forest were pleasanter \nto hear than the shouts of fighting men outside; and even when the \nRed King and his Court came hunting through its solitudes, cursing \nloud and riding hard, with a jingling of stirrups and bridles and \nknives and daggers, they did much less harm there than among the \nEnglish or Normans, and the stags died (as they lived) far easier \nthan the people.\n\nUpon a day in August, the Red King, now reconciled to his brother, \nFine-Scholar, came with a great train to hunt in the New Forest.  \nFine-Scholar was of the party.  They were a merry party, and had \nlain all night at Malwood-Keep, a hunting-lodge in the forest, \nwhere they had made good cheer, both at supper and breakfast, and \nhad drunk a deal of wine.  The party dispersed in various \ndirections, as the custom of hunters then was.  The King took with \nhim only SIR WALTER TYRREL, who was a famous sportsman, and to whom \nhe had given, before they mounted horse that morning, two fine \narrows.\n\nThe last time the King was ever seen alive, he was riding with Sir \nWalter Tyrrel, and their dogs were hunting together.\n\nIt was almost night, when a poor charcoal-burner, passing through \nthe forest with his cart, came upon the solitary body of a dead \nman, shot with an arrow in the breast, and still bleeding.  He got \nit into his cart.  It was the body of the King.  Shaken and \ntumbled, with its red beard all whitened with lime and clotted with \nblood, it was driven in the cart by the charcoal-burner next day to \nWinchester Cathedral, where it was received and buried.\n\nSir Walter Tyrrel, who escaped to Normandy, and claimed the \nprotection of the King of France, swore in France that the Red King \nwas suddenly shot dead by an arrow from an unseen hand, while they \nwere hunting together; that he was fearful of being suspected as \nthe King\'s murderer; and that he instantly set spurs to his horse, \nand fled to the sea-shore.  Others declared that the King and Sir \nWalter Tyrrel were hunting in company, a little before sunset, \nstanding in bushes opposite one another, when a stag came between \nthem.  That the King drew his bow and took aim, but the string \nbroke.  That the King then cried, \'Shoot, Walter, in the Devil\'s \nname!\'  That Sir Walter shot.  That the arrow glanced against a \ntree, was turned aside from the stag, and struck the King from his \nhorse, dead.\n\nBy whose hand the Red King really fell, and whether that hand \ndespatched the arrow to his breast by accident or by design, is \nonly known to GOD.  Some think his brother may have caused him to \nbe killed; but the Red King had made so many enemies, both among \npriests and people, that suspicion may reasonably rest upon a less \nunnatural murderer.  Men know no more than that he was found dead \nin the New Forest, which the suffering people had regarded as a \ndoomed ground for his race.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE FIRST, CALLED FINE-SCHOLAR\n\n\n\nFINE-SCHOLAR, on hearing of the Red King\'s death, hurried to \nWinchester with as much speed as Rufus himself had made, to seize \nthe Royal treasure.  But the keeper of the treasure who had been \none of the hunting-party in the Forest, made haste to Winchester \ntoo, and, arriving there at about the same time, refused to yield \nit up.  Upon this, Fine-Scholar drew his sword, and threatened to \nkill the treasurer; who might have paid for his fidelity with his \nlife, but that he knew longer resistance to be useless when he \nfound the Prince supported by a company of powerful barons, who \ndeclared they were determined to make him King.  The treasurer, \ntherefore, gave up the money and jewels of the Crown:  and on the \nthird day after the death of the Red King, being a Sunday, Fine-\nScholar stood before the high altar in Westminster Abbey, and made \na solemn declaration that he would resign the Church property which \nhis brother had seized; that he would do no wrong to the nobles; \nand that he would restore to the people the laws of Edward the \nConfessor, with all the improvements of William the Conqueror.  So \nbegan the reign of KING HENRY THE FIRST.\n\nThe people were attached to their new King, both because he had \nknown distresses, and because he was an Englishman by birth and not \na Norman.  To strengthen this last hold upon them, the King wished \nto marry an English lady; and could think of no other wife than \nMAUD THE GOOD, the daughter of the King of Scotland.  Although this \ngood Princess did not love the King, she was so affected by the \nrepresentations the nobles made to her of the great charity it \nwould be in her to unite the Norman and Saxon races, and prevent \nhatred and bloodshed between them for the future, that she \nconsented to become his wife.  After some disputing among the \npriests, who said that as she had been in a convent in her youth, \nand had worn the veil of a nun, she could not lawfully be married - \nagainst which the Princess stated that her aunt, with whom she had \nlived in her youth, had indeed sometimes thrown a piece of black \nstuff over her, but for no other reason than because the nun\'s veil \nwas the only dress the conquering Normans respected in girl or \nwoman, and not because she had taken the vows of a nun, which she \nnever had - she was declared free to marry, and was made King \nHenry\'s Queen.  A good Queen she was; beautiful, kind-hearted, and \nworthy of a better husband than the King.\n\nFor he was a cunning and unscrupulous man, though firm and clever.  \nHe cared very little for his word, and took any means to gain his \nends.  All this is shown in his treatment of his brother Robert - \nRobert, who had suffered him to be refreshed with water, and who \nhad sent him the wine from his own table, when he was shut up, with \nthe crows flying below him, parched with thirst, in the castle on \nthe top of St. Michael\'s Mount, where his Red brother would have \nlet him die.\n\nBefore the King began to deal with Robert, he removed and disgraced \nall the favourites of the late King; who were for the most part \nbase characters, much detested by the people.  Flambard, or \nFirebrand, whom the late King had made Bishop of Durham, of all \nthings in the world, Henry imprisoned in the Tower; but Firebrand \nwas a great joker and a jolly companion, and made himself so \npopular with his guards that they pretended to know nothing about a \nlong rope that was sent into his prison at the bottom of a deep \nflagon of wine.  The guards took the wine, and Firebrand took the \nrope; with which, when they were fast asleep, he let himself down \nfrom a window in the night, and so got cleverly aboard ship and \naway to Normandy.\n\nNow Robert, when his brother Fine-Scholar came to the throne, was \nstill absent in the Holy Land.  Henry pretended that Robert had \nbeen made Sovereign of that country; and he had been away so long, \nthat the ignorant people believed it.  But, behold, when Henry had \nbeen some time King of England, Robert came home to Normandy; \nhaving leisurely returned from Jerusalem through Italy, in which \nbeautiful country he had enjoyed himself very much, and had married \na lady as beautiful as itself!  In Normandy, he found Firebrand \nwaiting to urge him to assert his claim to the English crown, and \ndeclare war against King Henry.  This, after great loss of time in \nfeasting and dancing with his beautiful Italian wife among his \nNorman friends, he at last did.\n\nThe English in general were on King Henry\'s side, though many of \nthe Normans were on Robert\'s.  But the English sailors deserted the \nKing, and took a great part of the English fleet over to Normandy; \nso that Robert came to invade this country in no foreign vessels, \nbut in English ships.  The virtuous Anselm, however, whom Henry had \ninvited back from abroad, and made Archbishop of Canterbury, was \nsteadfast in the King\'s cause; and it was so well supported that \nthe two armies, instead of fighting, made a peace.  Poor Robert, \nwho trusted anybody and everybody, readily trusted his brother, the \nKing; and agreed to go home and receive a pension from England, on \ncondition that all his followers were fully pardoned.  This the \nKing very faithfully promised, but Robert was no sooner gone than \nhe began to punish them.\n\nAmong them was the Earl of Shrewsbury, who, on being summoned by \nthe King to answer to five-and-forty accusations, rode away to one \nof his strong castles, shut himself up therein, called around him \nhis tenants and vassals, and fought for his liberty, but was \ndefeated and banished.  Robert, with all his faults, was so true to \nhis word, that when he first heard of this nobleman having risen \nagainst his brother, he laid waste the Earl of Shrewsbury\'s estates \nin Normandy, to show the King that he would favour no breach of \ntheir treaty.  Finding, on better information, afterwards, that the \nEarl\'s only crime was having been his friend, he came over to \nEngland, in his old thoughtless, warm-hearted way, to intercede \nwith the King, and remind him of the solemn promise to pardon all \nhis followers.\n\nThis confidence might have put the false King to the blush, but it \ndid not.  Pretending to be very friendly, he so surrounded his \nbrother with spies and traps, that Robert, who was quite in his \npower, had nothing for it but to renounce his pension and escape \nwhile he could.  Getting home to Normandy, and understanding the \nKing better now, he naturally allied himself with his old friend \nthe Earl of Shrewsbury, who had still thirty castles in that \ncountry.  This was exactly what Henry wanted.  He immediately \ndeclared that Robert had broken the treaty, and next year invaded \nNormandy.\n\nHe pretended that he came to deliver the Normans, at their own \nrequest, from his brother\'s misrule.  There is reason to fear that \nhis misrule was bad enough; for his beautiful wife had died, \nleaving him with an infant son, and his court was again so \ncareless, dissipated, and ill-regulated, that it was said he \nsometimes lay in bed of a day for want of clothes to put on - his \nattendants having stolen all his dresses.  But he headed his army \nlike a brave prince and a gallant soldier, though he had the \nmisfortune to be taken prisoner by King Henry, with four hundred of \nhis Knights.  Among them was poor harmless Edgar Atheling, who \nloved Robert well.  Edgar was not important enough to be severe \nwith.  The King afterwards gave him a small pension, which he lived \nupon and died upon, in peace, among the quiet woods and fields of \nEngland.\n\nAnd Robert - poor, kind, generous, wasteful, heedless Robert, with \nso many faults, and yet with virtues that might have made a better \nand a happier man - what was the end of him?  If the King had had \nthe magnanimity to say with a kind air, \'Brother, tell me, before \nthese noblemen, that from this time you will be my faithful \nfollower and friend, and never raise your hand against me or my \nforces more!\' he might have trusted Robert to the death.  But the \nKing was not a magnanimous man.  He sentenced his brother to be \nconfined for life in one of the Royal Castles.  In the beginning of \nhis imprisonment, he was allowed to ride out, guarded; but he one \nday broke away from his guard and galloped of.  He had the evil \nfortune to ride into a swamp, where his horse stuck fast and he was \ntaken.  When the King heard of it he ordered him to be blinded, \nwhich was done by putting a red-hot metal basin on his eyes.\n\nAnd so, in darkness and in prison, many years, he thought of all \nhis past life, of the time he had wasted, of the treasure he had \nsquandered, of the opportunities he had lost, of the youth he had \nthrown away, of the talents he had neglected.  Sometimes, on fine \nautumn mornings, he would sit and think of the old hunting parties \nin the free Forest, where he had been the foremost and the gayest.  \nSometimes, in the still nights, he would wake, and mourn for the \nmany nights that had stolen past him at the gaming-table; \nsometimes, would seem to hear, upon the melancholy wind, the old \nsongs of the minstrels; sometimes, would dream, in his blindness, \nof the light and glitter of the Norman Court.  Many and many a \ntime, he groped back, in his fancy, to Jerusalem, where he had \nfought so well; or, at the head of his brave companions, bowed his \nfeathered helmet to the shouts of welcome greeting him in Italy, \nand seemed again to walk among the sunny vineyards, or on the shore \nof the blue sea, with his lovely wife.  And then, thinking of her \ngrave, and of his fatherless boy, he would stretch out his solitary \narms and weep.\n\nAt length, one day, there lay in prison, dead, with cruel and \ndisfiguring scars upon his eyelids, bandaged from his jailer\'s \nsight, but on which the eternal Heavens looked down, a worn old man \nof eighty.  He had once been Robert of Normandy.  Pity him!\n\nAt the time when Robert of Normandy was taken prisoner by his \nbrother, Robert\'s little son was only five years old.  This child \nwas taken, too, and carried before the King, sobbing and crying; \nfor, young as he was, he knew he had good reason to be afraid of \nhis Royal uncle.  The King was not much accustomed to pity those \nwho were in his power, but his cold heart seemed for the moment to \nsoften towards the boy.  He was observed to make a great effort, as \nif to prevent himself from being cruel, and ordered the child to be \ntaken away; whereupon a certain Baron, who had married a daughter \nof Duke Robert\'s (by name, Helie of Saint Saen), took charge of \nhim, tenderly.  The King\'s gentleness did not last long.  Before \ntwo years were over, he sent messengers to this lord\'s Castle to \nseize the child and bring him away.  The Baron was not there at the \ntime, but his servants were faithful, and carried the boy off in \nhis sleep and hid him.  When the Baron came home, and was told what \nthe King had done, he took the child abroad, and, leading him by \nthe hand, went from King to King and from Court to Court, relating \nhow the child had a claim to the throne of England, and how his \nuncle the King, knowing that he had that claim, would have murdered \nhim, perhaps, but for his escape.\n\nThe youth and innocence of the pretty little WILLIAM FITZ-ROBERT \n(for that was his name) made him many friends at that time.  When \nhe became a young man, the King of France, uniting with the French \nCounts of Anjou and Flanders, supported his cause against the King \nof England, and took many of the King\'s towns and castles in \nNormandy.  But, King Henry, artful and cunning always, bribed some \nof William\'s friends with money, some with promises, some with \npower.  He bought off the Count of Anjou, by promising to marry his \neldest son, also named WILLIAM, to the Count\'s daughter; and indeed \nthe whole trust of this King\'s life was in such bargains, and he \nbelieved (as many another King has done since, and as one King did \nin France a very little time ago) that every man\'s truth and honour \ncan be bought at some price.  For all this, he was so afraid of \nWilliam Fitz-Robert and his friends, that, for a long time, he \nbelieved his life to be in danger; and never lay down to sleep, \neven in his palace surrounded by his guards, without having a sword \nand buckler at his bedside.\n\nTo strengthen his power, the King with great ceremony betrothed his \neldest daughter MATILDA, then a child only eight years old, to be \nthe wife of Henry the Fifth, the Emperor of Germany.  To raise her \nmarriage-portion, he taxed the English people in a most oppressive \nmanner; then treated them to a great procession, to restore their \ngood humour; and sent Matilda away, in fine state, with the German \nambassadors, to be educated in the country of her future husband.\n\nAnd now his Queen, Maud the Good, unhappily died.  It was a sad \nthought for that gentle lady, that the only hope with which she had \nmarried a man whom she had never loved - the hope of reconciling \nthe Norman and English races - had failed.  At the very time of her \ndeath, Normandy and all France was in arms against England; for, so \nsoon as his last danger was over, King Henry had been false to all \nthe French powers he had promised, bribed, and bought, and they had \nnaturally united against him.  After some fighting, however, in \nwhich few suffered but the unhappy common people (who always \nsuffered, whatsoever was the matter), he began to promise, bribe, \nand buy again; and by those means, and by the help of the Pope, who \nexerted himself to save more bloodshed, and by solemnly declaring, \nover and over again, that he really was in earnest this time, and \nwould keep his word, the King made peace.\n\nOne of the first consequences of this peace was, that the King went \nover to Normandy with his son Prince William and a great retinue, \nto have the Prince acknowledged as his successor by the Norman \nNobles, and to contract the promised marriage (this was one of the \nmany promises the King had broken) between him and the daughter of \nthe Count of Anjou.  Both these things were triumphantly done, with \ngreat show and rejoicing; and on the twenty-fifth of November, in \nthe year one thousand one hundred and twenty, the whole retinue \nprepared to embark at the Port of Barfleur, for the voyage home.\n\nOn that day, and at that place, there came to the King, Fitz-\nStephen, a sea-captain, and said:\n\n\'My liege, my father served your father all his life, upon the sea.  \nHe steered the ship with the golden boy upon the prow, in which \nyour father sailed to conquer England.  I beseech you to grant me \nthe same office.  I have a fair vessel in the harbour here, called \nThe White Ship, manned by fifty sailors of renown.  I pray you, \nSire, to let your servant have the honour of steering you in The \nWhite Ship to England!\'\n\n\'I am sorry, friend,\' replied the King, \'that my vessel is already \nchosen, and that I cannot (therefore) sail with the son of the man \nwho served my father.  But the Prince and all his company shall go \nalong with you, in the fair White Ship, manned by the fifty sailors \nof renown.\'\n\nAn hour or two afterwards, the King set sail in the vessel he had \nchosen, accompanied by other vessels, and, sailing all night with a \nfair and gentle wind, arrived upon the coast of England in the \nmorning.  While it was yet night, the people in some of those ships \nheard a faint wild cry come over the sea, and wondered what it was.\n\nNow, the Prince was a dissolute, debauched young man of eighteen, \nwho bore no love to the English, and had declared that when he came \nto the throne he would yoke them to the plough like oxen.  He went \naboard The White Ship, with one hundred and forty youthful Nobles \nlike himself, among whom were eighteen noble ladies of the highest \nrank.  All this gay company, with their servants and the fifty \nsailors, made three hundred souls aboard the fair White Ship.\n\n\'Give three casks of wine, Fitz-Stephen,\' said the Prince, \'to the \nfifty sailors of renown!  My father the King has sailed out of the \nharbour.  What time is there to make merry here, and yet reach \nEngland with the rest?\'\n\n\'Prince!\' said Fitz-Stephen, \'before morning, my fifty and The \nWhite Ship shall overtake the swiftest vessel in attendance on your \nfather the King, if we sail at midnight!\'\n\nThen the Prince commanded to make merry; and the sailors drank out \nthe three casks of wine; and the Prince and all the noble company \ndanced in the moonlight on the deck of The White Ship.\n\nWhen, at last, she shot out of the harbour of Barfleur, there was \nnot a sober seaman on board.  But the sails were all set, and the \noars all going merrily.  Fitz-Stephen had the helm.  The gay young \nnobles and the beautiful ladies, wrapped in mantles of various \nbright colours to protect them from the cold, talked, laughed, and \nsang.  The Prince encouraged the fifty sailors to row harder yet, \nfor the honour of The White Ship.\n\nCrash!  A terrific cry broke from three hundred hearts.  It was the \ncry the people in the distant vessels of the King heard faintly on \nthe water.  The White Ship had struck upon a rock - was filling - \ngoing down!\n\nFitz-Stephen hurried the Prince into a boat, with some few Nobles.  \n\'Push off,\' he whispered; \'and row to land.  It is not far, and the \nsea is smooth.  The rest of us must die.\'\n\nBut, as they rowed away, fast, from the sinking ship, the Prince \nheard the voice of his sister MARIE, the Countess of Perche, \ncalling for help.  He never in his life had been so good as he was \nthen.  He cried in an agony, \'Row back at any risk!  I cannot bear \nto leave her!\'\n\nThey rowed back.  As the Prince held out his arms to catch his \nsister, such numbers leaped in, that the boat was overset.  And in \nthe same instant The White Ship went down.\n\nOnly two men floated.  They both clung to the main yard of the \nship, which had broken from the mast, and now supported them.  One \nasked the other who he was?  He said, \'I am a nobleman, GODFREY by \nname, the son of GILBERT DE L\'AIGLE.  And you?\' said he.  \'I am \nBEROLD, a poor butcher of Rouen,\' was the answer.  Then, they said \ntogether, \'Lord be merciful to us both!\' and tried to encourage one \nanother, as they drifted in the cold benumbing sea on that \nunfortunate November night.\n\nBy-and-by, another man came swimming towards them, whom they knew, \nwhen he pushed aside his long wet hair, to be Fitz-Stephen.  \'Where \nis the Prince?\' said he.  \'Gone! Gone!\' the two cried together.  \n\'Neither he, nor his brother, nor his sister, nor the King\'s niece, \nnor her brother, nor any one of all the brave three hundred, noble \nor commoner, except we three, has risen above the water!\'  Fitz-\nStephen, with a ghastly face, cried, \'Woe! woe, to me!\' and sunk to \nthe bottom.\n\nThe other two clung to the yard for some hours.  At length the \nyoung noble said faintly, \'I am exhausted, and chilled with the \ncold, and can hold no longer.  Farewell, good friend!  God preserve \nyou!\'  So, he dropped and sunk; and of all the brilliant crowd, the \npoor Butcher of Rouen alone was saved.  In the morning, some \nfishermen saw him floating in his sheep-skin coat, and got him into \ntheir boat - the sole relater of the dismal tale.\n\nFor three days, no one dared to carry the intelligence to the King.  \nAt length, they sent into his presence a little boy, who, weeping \nbitterly, and kneeling at his feet, told him that The White Ship \nwas lost with all on board.  The King fell to the ground like a \ndead man, and never, never afterwards, was seen to smile.\n\nBut he plotted again, and promised again, and bribed and bought \nagain, in his old deceitful way.  Having no son to succeed him, \nafter all his pains (\'The Prince will never yoke us to the plough, \nnow!\' said the English people), he took a second wife - ADELAIS or \nALICE, a duke\'s daughter, and the Pope\'s niece.  Having no more \nchildren, however, he proposed to the Barons to swear that they \nwould recognise as his successor, his daughter Matilda, whom, as \nshe was now a widow, he married to the eldest son of the Count of \nAnjou, GEOFFREY, surnamed PLANTAGENET, from a custom he had of \nwearing a sprig of flowering broom (called Genàt in French) in his \ncap for a feather.  As one false man usually makes many, and as a \nfalse King, in particular, is pretty certain to make a false Court, \nthe Barons took the oath about the succession of Matilda (and her \nchildren after her), twice over, without in the least intending to \nkeep it.  The King was now relieved from any remaining fears of \nWilliam Fitz-Robert, by his death in the Monastery of St. Omer, in \nFrance, at twenty-six years old, of a pike-wound in the hand.  And \nas Matilda gave birth to three sons, he thought the succession to \nthe throne secure.\n\nHe spent most of the latter part of his life, which was troubled by \nfamily quarrels, in Normandy, to be near Matilda.  When he had \nreigned upward of thirty-five years, and was sixty-seven years old, \nhe died of an indigestion and fever, brought on by eating, when he \nwas far from well, of a fish called Lamprey, against which he had \noften been cautioned by his physicians.  His remains were brought \nover to Reading Abbey to be buried.\n\nYou may perhaps hear the cunning and promise-breaking of King Henry \nthe First, called \'policy\' by some people, and \'diplomacy\' by \nothers.  Neither of these fine words will in the least mean that it \nwas true; and nothing that is not true can possibly be good.\n\nHis greatest merit, that I know of, was his love of learning - I \nshould have given him greater credit even for that, if it had been \nstrong enough to induce him to spare the eyes of a certain poet he \nonce took prisoner, who was a knight besides.  But he ordered the \npoet\'s eyes to be torn from his head, because he had laughed at him \nin his verses; and the poet, in the pain of that torture, dashed \nout his own brains against his prison wall.  King Henry the First \nwas avaricious, revengeful, and so false, that I suppose a man \nnever lived whose word was less to be relied upon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI - ENGLAND UNDER MATILDA AND STEPHEN\n\n\n\nTHE King was no sooner dead than all the plans and schemes he had \nlaboured at so long, and lied so much for, crumbled away like a \nhollow heap of sand.  STEPHEN, whom he had never mistrusted or \nsuspected, started up to claim the throne.\n\nStephen was the son of ADELA, the Conqueror\'s daughter, married to \nthe Count of Blois.  To Stephen, and to his brother HENRY, the late \nKing had been liberal; making Henry Bishop of Winchester, and \nfinding a good marriage for Stephen, and much enriching him.  This \ndid not prevent Stephen from hastily producing a false witness, a \nservant of the late King, to swear that the King had named him for \nhis heir upon his death-bed.  On this evidence the Archbishop of \nCanterbury crowned him.  The new King, so suddenly made, lost not a \nmoment in seizing the Royal treasure, and hiring foreign soldiers \nwith some of it to protect his throne.\n\nIf the dead King had even done as the false witness said, he would \nhave had small right to will away the English people, like so many \nsheep or oxen, without their consent.  But he had, in fact, \nbequeathed all his territory to Matilda; who, supported by ROBERT, \nEarl of Gloucester, soon began to dispute the crown.  Some of the \npowerful barons and priests took her side; some took Stephen\'s; all \nfortified their castles; and again the miserable English people \nwere involved in war, from which they could never derive advantage \nwhosoever was victorious, and in which all parties plundered, \ntortured, starved, and ruined them.\n\nFive years had passed since the death of Henry the First - and \nduring those five years there had been two terrible invasions by \nthe people of Scotland under their King, David, who was at last \ndefeated with all his army - when Matilda, attended by her brother \nRobert and a large force, appeared in England to maintain her \nclaim.  A battle was fought between her troops and King Stephen\'s \nat Lincoln; in which the King himself was taken prisoner, after \nbravely fighting until his battle-axe and sword were broken, and \nwas carried into strict confinement at Gloucester.  Matilda then \nsubmitted herself to the Priests, and the Priests crowned her Queen \nof England.\n\nShe did not long enjoy this dignity.  The people of London had a \ngreat affection for Stephen; many of the Barons considered it \ndegrading to be ruled by a woman; and the Queen\'s temper was so \nhaughty that she made innumerable enemies.  The people of London \nrevolted; and, in alliance with the troops of Stephen, besieged her \nat Winchester, where they took her brother Robert prisoner, whom, \nas her best soldier and chief general, she was glad to exchange for \nStephen himself, who thus regained his liberty.  Then, the long war \nwent on afresh.  Once, she was pressed so hard in the Castle of \nOxford, in the winter weather when the snow lay thick upon the \nground, that her only chance of escape was to dress herself all in \nwhite, and, accompanied by no more than three faithful Knights, \ndressed in like manner that their figures might not be seen from \nStephen\'s camp as they passed over the snow, to steal away on foot, \ncross the frozen Thames, walk a long distance, and at last gallop \naway on horseback.  All this she did, but to no great purpose then; \nfor her brother dying while the struggle was yet going on, she at \nlast withdrew to Normandy.\n\nIn two or three years after her withdrawal her cause appeared in \nEngland, afresh, in the person of her son Henry, young Plantagenet, \nwho, at only eighteen years of age, was very powerful:  not only on \naccount of his mother having resigned all Normandy to him, but also \nfrom his having married ELEANOR, the divorced wife of the French \nKing, a bad woman, who had great possessions in France.  Louis, the \nFrench King, not relishing this arrangement, helped EUSTACE, King \nStephen\'s son, to invade Normandy:  but Henry drove their united \nforces out of that country, and then returned here, to assist his \npartisans, whom the King was then besieging at Wallingford upon the \nThames.  Here, for two days, divided only by the river, the two \narmies lay encamped opposite to one another - on the eve, as it \nseemed to all men, of another desperate fight, when the EARL OF \nARUNDEL took heart and said \'that it was not reasonable to prolong \nthe unspeakable miseries of two kingdoms to minister to the \nambition of two princes.\'\n\nMany other noblemen repeating and supporting this when it was once \nuttered, Stephen and young Plantagenet went down, each to his own \nbank of the river, and held a conversation across it, in which they \narranged a truce; very much to the dissatisfaction of Eustace, who \nswaggered away with some followers, and laid violent hands on the \nAbbey of St. Edmund\'s-Bury, where he presently died mad.  The truce \nled to a solemn council at Winchester, in which it was agreed that \nStephen should retain the crown, on condition of his declaring \nHenry his successor; that WILLIAM, another son of the King\'s, \nshould inherit his father\'s rightful possessions; and that all the \nCrown lands which Stephen had given away should be recalled, and \nall the Castles he had permitted to be built demolished.  Thus \nterminated the bitter war, which had now lasted fifteen years, and \nhad again laid England waste.  In the next year STEPHEN died, after \na troubled reign of nineteen years.\n\nAlthough King Stephen was, for the time in which he lived, a humane \nand moderate man, with many excellent qualities; and although \nnothing worse is known of him than his usurpation of the Crown, \nwhich he probably excused to himself by the consideration that King \nHenry the First was a usurper too - which was no excuse at all; the \npeople of England suffered more in these dread nineteen years, than \nat any former period even of their suffering history.  In the \ndivision of the nobility between the two rival claimants of the \nCrown, and in the growth of what is called the Feudal System (which \nmade the peasants the born vassals and mere slaves of the Barons), \nevery Noble had his strong Castle, where he reigned the cruel king \nof all the neighbouring people.  Accordingly, he perpetrated \nwhatever cruelties he chose.  And never were worse cruelties \ncommitted upon earth than in wretched England in those nineteen \nyears.\n\nThe writers who were living then describe them fearfully.  They say \nthat the castles were filled with devils rather than with men; that \nthe peasants, men and women, were put into dungeons for their gold \nand silver, were tortured with fire and smoke, were hung up by the \nthumbs, were hung up by the heels with great weights to their \nheads, were torn with jagged irons, killed with hunger, broken to \ndeath in narrow chests filled with sharp-pointed stones, murdered \nin countless fiendish ways.  In England there was no corn, no meat, \nno cheese, no butter, there were no tilled lands, no harvests.  \nAshes of burnt towns, and dreary wastes, were all that the \ntraveller, fearful of the robbers who prowled abroad at all hours, \nwould see in a long day\'s journey; and from sunrise until night, he \nwould not come upon a home.\n\nThe clergy sometimes suffered, and heavily too, from pillage, but \nmany of them had castles of their own, and fought in helmet and \narmour like the barons, and drew lots with other fighting men for \ntheir share of booty.  The Pope (or Bishop of Rome), on King \nStephen\'s resisting his ambition, laid England under an Interdict \nat one period of this reign; which means that he allowed no service \nto be performed in the churches, no couples to be married, no bells \nto be rung, no dead bodies to be buried.  Any man having the power \nto refuse these things, no matter whether he were called a Pope or \na Poulterer, would, of course, have the power of afflicting numbers \nof innocent people.  That nothing might be wanting to the miseries \nof King Stephen\'s time, the Pope threw in this contribution to the \npublic store - not very like the widow\'s contribution, as I think, \nwhen Our Saviour sat in Jerusalem over-against the Treasury, \'and \nshe threw in two mites, which make a farthing.\'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE SECOND - PART THE FIRST\n\n\n\nHENRY PLANTAGENET, when he was but twenty-one years old, quietly \nsucceeded to the throne of England, according to his agreement made \nwith the late King at Winchester.  Six weeks after Stephen\'s death, \nhe and his Queen, Eleanor, were crowned in that city; into which \nthey rode on horseback in great state, side by side, amidst much \nshouting and rejoicing, and clashing of music, and strewing of \nflowers.\n\nThe reign of King Henry the Second began well.  The King had great \npossessions, and (what with his own rights, and what with those of \nhis wife) was lord of one-third part of France.  He was a young man \nof vigour, ability, and resolution, and immediately applied himself \nto remove some of the evils which had arisen in the last unhappy \nreign.  He revoked all the grants of land that had been hastily \nmade, on either side, during the late struggles; he obliged numbers \nof disorderly soldiers to depart from England; he reclaimed all the \ncastles belonging to the Crown; and he forced the wicked nobles to \npull down their own castles, to the number of eleven hundred, in \nwhich such dismal cruelties had been inflicted on the people.  The \nKing\'s brother, GEOFFREY, rose against him in France, while he was \nso well employed, and rendered it necessary for him to repair to \nthat country; where, after he had subdued and made a friendly \narrangement with his brother (who did not live long), his ambition \nto increase his possessions involved him in a war with the French \nKing, Louis, with whom he had been on such friendly terms just \nbefore, that to the French King\'s infant daughter, then a baby in \nthe cradle, he had promised one of his little sons in marriage, who \nwas a child of five years old.  However, the war came to nothing at \nlast, and the Pope made the two Kings friends again.\n\nNow, the clergy, in the troubles of the last reign, had gone on \nvery ill indeed.  There were all kinds of criminals among them - \nmurderers, thieves, and vagabonds; and the worst of the matter was, \nthat the good priests would not give up the bad priests to justice, \nwhen they committed crimes, but persisted in sheltering and \ndefending them.  The King, well knowing that there could be no \npeace or rest in England while such things lasted, resolved to \nreduce the power of the clergy; and, when he had reigned seven \nyears, found (as he considered) a good opportunity for doing so, in \nthe death of the Archbishop of Canterbury.  \'I will have for the \nnew Archbishop,\' thought the King, \'a friend in whom I can trust, \nwho will help me to humble these rebellious priests, and to have \nthem dealt with, when they do wrong, as other men who do wrong are \ndealt with.\'  So, he resolved to make his favourite, the new \nArchbishop; and this favourite was so extraordinary a man, and his \nstory is so curious, that I must tell you all about him.\n\nOnce upon a time, a worthy merchant of London, named GILBERT A \nBECKET, made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and was taken prisoner \nby a Saracen lord.  This lord, who treated him kindly and not like \na slave, had one fair daughter, who fell in love with the merchant; \nand who told him that she wanted to become a Christian, and was \nwilling to marry him if they could fly to a Christian country.  The \nmerchant returned her love, until he found an opportunity to \nescape, when he did not trouble himself about the Saracen lady, but \nescaped with his servant Richard, who had been taken prisoner along \nwith him, and arrived in England and forgot her.  The Saracen lady, \nwho was more loving than the merchant, left her father\'s house in \ndisguise to follow him, and made her way, under many hardships, to \nthe sea-shore.  The merchant had taught her only two English words \n(for I suppose he must have learnt the Saracen tongue himself, and \nmade love in that language), of which LONDON was one, and his own \nname, GILBERT, the other.  She went among the ships, saying, \n\'London! London!\' over and over again, until the sailors understood \nthat she wanted to find an English vessel that would carry her \nthere; so they showed her such a ship, and she paid for her passage \nwith some of her jewels, and sailed away.  Well!  The merchant was \nsitting in his counting-house in London one day, when he heard a \ngreat noise in the street; and presently Richard came running in \nfrom the warehouse, with his eyes wide open and his breath almost \ngone, saying, \'Master, master, here is the Saracen lady!\'  The \nmerchant thought Richard was mad; but Richard said, \'No, master!  \nAs I live, the Saracen lady is going up and down the city, calling \nGilbert!  Gilbert!\'  Then, he took the merchant by the sleeve, and \npointed out of window; and there they saw her among the gables and \nwater-spouts of the dark, dirty street, in her foreign dress, so \nforlorn, surrounded by a wondering crowd, and passing slowly along, \ncalling Gilbert, Gilbert!  When the merchant saw her, and thought \nof the tenderness she had shown him in his captivity, and of her \nconstancy, his heart was moved, and he ran down into the street; \nand she saw him coming, and with a great cry fainted in his arms.  \nThey were married without loss of time, and Richard (who was an \nexcellent man) danced with joy the whole day of the wedding; and \nthey all lived happy ever afterwards.\n\nThis merchant and this Saracen lady had one son, THOMAS A BECKET.  \nHe it was who became the Favourite of King Henry the Second.\n\nHe had become Chancellor, when the King thought of making him \nArchbishop.  He was clever, gay, well educated, brave; had fought \nin several battles in France; had defeated a French knight in \nsingle combat, and brought his horse away as a token of the \nvictory.  He lived in a noble palace, he was the tutor of the young \nPrince Henry, he was served by one hundred and forty knights, his \nriches were immense.  The King once sent him as his ambassador to \nFrance; and the French people, beholding in what state he \ntravelled, cried out in the streets, \'How splendid must the King of \nEngland be, when this is only the Chancellor!\'  They had good \nreason to wonder at the magnificence of Thomas a Becket, for, when \nhe entered a French town, his procession was headed by two hundred \nand fifty singing boys; then, came his hounds in couples; then, \neight waggons, each drawn by five horses driven by five drivers:  \ntwo of the waggons filled with strong ale to be given away to the \npeople; four, with his gold and silver plate and stately clothes; \ntwo, with the dresses of his numerous servants.  Then, came twelve \nhorses, each with a monkey on his back; then, a train of people \nbearing shields and leading fine war-horses splendidly equipped; \nthen, falconers with hawks upon their wrists; then, a host of \nknights, and gentlemen and priests; then, the Chancellor with his \nbrilliant garments flashing in the sun, and all the people capering \nand shouting with delight.\n\nThe King was well pleased with all this, thinking that it only made \nhimself the more magnificent to have so magnificent a favourite; \nbut he sometimes jested with the Chancellor upon his splendour too.  \nOnce, when they were riding together through the streets of London \nin hard winter weather, they saw a shivering old man in rags.  \n\'Look at the poor object!\' said the King.  \'Would it not be a \ncharitable act to give that aged man a comfortable warm cloak?\'  \n\'Undoubtedly it would,\' said Thomas a Becket, \'and you do well, \nSir, to think of such Christian duties.\'  \'Come!\' cried the King, \n\'then give him your cloak!\'  It was made of rich crimson trimmed \nwith ermine.  The King tried to pull it off, the Chancellor tried \nto keep it on, both were near rolling from their saddles in the \nmud, when the Chancellor submitted, and the King gave the cloak to \nthe old beggar:  much to the beggar\'s astonishment, and much to the \nmerriment of all the courtiers in attendance.  For, courtiers are \nnot only eager to laugh when the King laughs, but they really do \nenjoy a laugh against a Favourite.\n\n\'I will make,\' thought King Henry the second, \'this Chancellor of \nmine, Thomas a Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury.  He will then be \nthe head of the Church, and, being devoted to me, will help me to \ncorrect the Church.  He has always upheld my power against the \npower of the clergy, and once publicly told some bishops (I \nremember), that men of the Church were equally bound to me, with \nmen of the sword.  Thomas a Becket is the man, of all other men in \nEngland, to help me in my great design.\'  So the King, regardless \nof all objection, either that he was a fighting man, or a lavish \nman, or a courtly man, or a man of pleasure, or anything but a \nlikely man for the office, made him Archbishop accordingly.\n\nNow, Thomas a Becket was proud and loved to be famous.  He was \nalready famous for the pomp of his life, for his riches, his gold \nand silver plate, his waggons, horses, and attendants.  He could do \nno more in that way than he had done; and being tired of that kind \nof fame (which is a very poor one), he longed to have his name \ncelebrated for something else.  Nothing, he knew, would render him \nso famous in the world, as the setting of his utmost power and \nability against the utmost power and ability of the King.  He \nresolved with the whole strength of his mind to do it.\n\nHe may have had some secret grudge against the King besides.  The \nKing may have offended his proud humour at some time or other, for \nanything I know.  I think it likely, because it is a common thing \nfor Kings, Princes, and other great people, to try the tempers of \ntheir favourites rather severely.  Even the little affair of the \ncrimson cloak must have been anything but a pleasant one to a \nhaughty man.  Thomas a Becket knew better than any one in England \nwhat the King expected of him.  In all his sumptuous life, he had \nnever yet been in a position to disappoint the King.  He could take \nup that proud stand now, as head of the Church; and he determined \nthat it should be written in history, either that he subdued the \nKing, or that the King subdued him.\n\nSo, of a sudden, he completely altered the whole manner of his \nlife.  He turned off all his brilliant followers, ate coarse food, \ndrank bitter water, wore next his skin sackcloth covered with dirt \nand vermin (for it was then thought very religious to be very \ndirty), flogged his back to punish himself, lived chiefly in a \nlittle cell, washed the feet of thirteen poor people every day, and \nlooked as miserable as he possibly could.  If he had put twelve \nhundred monkeys on horseback instead of twelve, and had gone in \nprocession with eight thousand waggons instead of eight, he could \nnot have half astonished the people so much as by this great \nchange.  It soon caused him to be more talked about as an \nArchbishop than he had been as a Chancellor.\n\nThe King was very angry; and was made still more so, when the new \nArchbishop, claiming various estates from the nobles as being \nrightfully Church property, required the King himself, for the same \nreason, to give up Rochester Castle, and Rochester City too.  Not \nsatisfied with this, he declared that no power but himself should \nappoint a priest to any Church in the part of England over which he \nwas Archbishop; and when a certain gentleman of Kent made such an \nappointment, as he claimed to have the right to do, Thomas a Becket \nexcommunicated him.\n\nExcommunication was, next to the Interdict I told you of at the \nclose of the last chapter, the great weapon of the clergy.  It \nconsisted in declaring the person who was excommunicated, an \noutcast from the Church and from all religious offices; and in \ncursing him all over, from the top of his head to the sole of his \nfoot, whether he was standing up, lying down, sitting, kneeling, \nwalking, running, hopping, jumping, gaping, coughing, sneezing, or \nwhatever else he was doing.  This unchristian nonsense would of \ncourse have made no sort of difference to the person cursed - who \ncould say his prayers at home if he were shut out of church, and \nwhom none but GOD could judge - but for the fears and superstitions \nof the people, who avoided excommunicated persons, and made their \nlives unhappy.  So, the King said to the New Archbishop, \'Take off \nthis Excommunication from this gentleman of Kent.\'  To which the \nArchbishop replied, \'I shall do no such thing.\'\n\nThe quarrel went on.  A priest in Worcestershire committed a most \ndreadful murder, that aroused the horror of the whole nation.  The \nKing demanded to have this wretch delivered up, to be tried in the \nsame court and in the same way as any other murderer.  The \nArchbishop refused, and kept him in the Bishop\'s prison.  The King, \nholding a solemn assembly in Westminster Hall, demanded that in \nfuture all priests found guilty before their Bishops of crimes \nagainst the law of the land should be considered priests no longer, \nand should be delivered over to the law of the land for punishment.  \nThe Archbishop again refused.  The King required to know whether \nthe clergy would obey the ancient customs of the country?  Every \npriest there, but one, said, after Thomas a Becket, \'Saving my \norder.\'  This really meant that they would only obey those customs \nwhen they did not interfere with their own claims; and the King \nwent out of the Hall in great wrath.\n\nSome of the clergy began to be afraid, now, that they were going \ntoo far.  Though Thomas a Becket was otherwise as unmoved as \nWestminster Hall, they prevailed upon him, for the sake of their \nfears, to go to the King at Woodstock, and promise to observe the \nancient customs of the country, without saying anything about his \norder.  The King received this submission favourably, and summoned \na great council of the clergy to meet at the Castle of Clarendon, \nby Salisbury.  But when the council met, the Archbishop again \ninsisted on the words \'saying my order;\' and he still insisted, \nthough lords entreated him, and priests wept before him and knelt \nto him, and an adjoining room was thrown open, filled with armed \nsoldiers of the King, to threaten him.  At length he gave way, for \nthat time, and the ancient customs (which included what the King \nhad demanded in vain) were stated in writing, and were signed and \nsealed by the chief of the clergy, and were called the \nConstitutions of Clarendon.\n\nThe quarrel went on, for all that.  The Archbishop tried to see the \nKing.  The King would not see him.  The Archbishop tried to escape \nfrom England.  The sailors on the coast would launch no boat to \ntake him away.  Then, he again resolved to do his worst in \nopposition to the King, and began openly to set the ancient customs \nat defiance.\n\nThe King summoned him before a great council at Northampton, where \nhe accused him of high treason, and made a claim against him, which \nwas not a just one, for an enormous sum of money.  Thomas a Becket \nwas alone against the whole assembly, and the very Bishops advised \nhim to resign his office and abandon his contest with the King.  \nHis great anxiety and agitation stretched him on a sick-bed for two \ndays, but he was still undaunted.  He went to the adjourned \ncouncil, carrying a great cross in his right hand, and sat down \nholding it erect before him.  The King angrily retired into an \ninner room.  The whole assembly angrily retired and left him there.  \nBut there he sat.  The Bishops came out again in a body, and \nrenounced him as a traitor.  He only said, \'I hear!\' and sat there \nstill.  They retired again into the inner room, and his trial \nproceeded without him.  By-and-by, the Earl of Leicester, heading \nthe barons, came out to read his sentence.  He refused to hear it, \ndenied the power of the court, and said he would refer his cause to \nthe Pope.  As he walked out of the hall, with the cross in his \nhand, some of those present picked up rushes - rushes were strewn \nupon the floors in those days by way of carpet - and threw them at \nhim.  He proudly turned his head, and said that were he not \nArchbishop, he would chastise those cowards with the sword he had \nknown how to use in bygone days.  He then mounted his horse, and \nrode away, cheered and surrounded by the common people, to whom he \nthrew open his house that night and gave a supper, supping with \nthem himself.  That same night he secretly departed from the town; \nand so, travelling by night and hiding by day, and calling himself \n\'Brother Dearman,\' got away, not without difficulty, to Flanders.\n\nThe struggle still went on.  The angry King took possession of the \nrevenues of the archbishopric, and banished all the relations and \nservants of Thomas a Becket, to the number of four hundred.  The \nPope and the French King both protected him, and an abbey was \nassigned for his residence.  Stimulated by this support, Thomas a \nBecket, on a great festival day, formally proceeded to a great \nchurch crowded with people, and going up into the pulpit publicly \ncursed and excommunicated all who had supported the Constitutions \nof Clarendon:  mentioning many English noblemen by name, and not \ndistantly hinting at the King of England himself.\n\nWhen intelligence of this new affront was carried to the King in \nhis chamber, his passion was so furious that he tore his clothes, \nand rolled like a madman on his bed of straw and rushes.  But he \nwas soon up and doing.  He ordered all the ports and coasts of \nEngland to be narrowly watched, that no letters of Interdict might \nbe brought into the kingdom; and sent messengers and bribes to the \nPope\'s palace at Rome.  Meanwhile, Thomas a Becket, for his part, \nwas not idle at Rome, but constantly employed his utmost arts in \nhis own behalf.  Thus the contest stood, until there was peace \nbetween France and England (which had been for some time at war), \nand until the two children of the two Kings were married in \ncelebration of it.  Then, the French King brought about a meeting \nbetween Henry and his old favourite, so long his enemy.\n\nEven then, though Thomas a Becket knelt before the King, he was \nobstinate and immovable as to those words about his order.  King \nLouis of France was weak enough in his veneration for Thomas a \nBecket and such men, but this was a little too much for him.  He \nsaid that a Becket \'wanted to be greater than the saints and better \nthan St. Peter,\' and rode away from him with the King of England.  \nHis poor French Majesty asked a Becket\'s pardon for so doing, \nhowever, soon afterwards, and cut a very pitiful figure.\n\nAt last, and after a world of trouble, it came to this.  There was \nanother meeting on French ground between King Henry and Thomas a \nBecket, and it was agreed that Thomas a Becket should be Archbishop \nof Canterbury, according to the customs of former Archbishops, and \nthat the King should put him in possession of the revenues of that \npost.  And now, indeed, you might suppose the struggle at an end, \nand Thomas a Becket at rest.  NO, not even yet.  For Thomas a \nBecket hearing, by some means, that King Henry, when he was in \ndread of his kingdom being placed under an interdict, had had his \neldest son Prince Henry secretly crowned, not only persuaded the \nPope to suspend the Archbishop of York who had performed that \nceremony, and to excommunicate the Bishops who had assisted at it, \nbut sent a messenger of his own into England, in spite of all the \nKing\'s precautions along the coast, who delivered the letters of \nexcommunication into the Bishops\' own hands.  Thomas a Becket then \ncame over to England himself, after an absence of seven years.  He \nwas privately warned that it was dangerous to come, and that an \nireful knight, named RANULF DE BROC, had threatened that he should \nnot live to eat a loaf of bread in England; but he came.\n\nThe common people received him well, and marched about with him in \na soldierly way, armed with such rustic weapons as they could get.  \nHe tried to see the young prince who had once been his pupil, but \nwas prevented.  He hoped for some little support among the nobles \nand priests, but found none.  He made the most of the peasants who \nattended him, and feasted them, and went from Canterbury to Harrow-\non-the-Hill, and from Harrow-on-the-Hill back to Canterbury, and on \nChristmas Day preached in the Cathedral there, and told the people \nin his sermon that he had come to die among them, and that it was \nlikely he would be murdered.  He had no fear, however - or, if he \nhad any, he had much more obstinacy - for he, then and there, \nexcommunicated three of his enemies, of whom Ranulf de Broc, the \nireful knight, was one.\n\nAs men in general had no fancy for being cursed, in their sitting \nand walking, and gaping and sneezing, and all the rest of it, it \nwas very natural in the persons so freely excommunicated to \ncomplain to the King.  It was equally natural in the King, who had \nhoped that this troublesome opponent was at last quieted, to fall \ninto a mighty rage when he heard of these new affronts; and, on the \nArchbishop of York telling him that he never could hope for rest \nwhile Thomas a Becket lived, to cry out hastily before his court, \n\'Have I no one here who will deliver me from this man?\'  There were \nfour knights present, who, hearing the King\'s words, looked at one \nanother, and went out.\n\nThe names of these knights were REGINALD FITZURSE, WILLIAM TRACY, \nHUGH DE MORVILLE, and RICHARD BRITO; three of whom had been in the \ntrain of Thomas a Becket in the old days of his splendour.  They \nrode away on horseback, in a very secret manner, and on the third \nday after Christmas Day arrived at Saltwood House, not far from \nCanterbury, which belonged to the family of Ranulf de Broc.  They \nquietly collected some followers here, in case they should need \nany; and proceeding to Canterbury, suddenly appeared (the four \nknights and twelve men) before the Archbishop, in his own house, at \ntwo o\'clock in the afternoon.  They neither bowed nor spoke, but \nsat down on the floor in silence, staring at the Archbishop.\n\nThomas a Becket said, at length, \'What do you want?\'\n\n\'We want,\' said Reginald Fitzurse, \'the excommunication taken from \nthe Bishops, and you to answer for your offences to the King.\'  \nThomas a Becket defiantly replied, that the power of the clergy was \nabove the power of the King.  That it was not for such men as they \nwere, to threaten him.  That if he were threatened by all the \nswords in England, he would never yield.\n\n\'Then we will do more than threaten!\' said the knights.  And they \nwent out with the twelve men, and put on their armour, and drew \ntheir shining swords, and came back.\n\nHis servants, in the meantime, had shut up and barred the great \ngate of the palace.  At first, the knights tried to shatter it with \ntheir battle-axes; but, being shown a window by which they could \nenter, they let the gate alone, and climbed in that way.  While \nthey were battering at the door, the attendants of Thomas a Becket \nhad implored him to take refuge in the Cathedral; in which, as a \nsanctuary or sacred place, they thought the knights would dare to \ndo no violent deed.  He told them, again and again, that he would \nnot stir.  Hearing the distant voices of the monks singing the \nevening service, however, he said it was now his duty to attend, \nand therefore, and for no other reason, he would go.\n\nThere was a near way between his Palace and the Cathedral, by some \nbeautiful old cloisters which you may yet see.  He went into the \nCathedral, without any hurry, and having the Cross carried before \nhim as usual.  When he was safely there, his servants would have \nfastened the door, but he said NO! it was the house of God and not \na fortress.\n\nAs he spoke, the shadow of Reginald Fitzurse appeared in the \nCathedral doorway, darkening the little light there was outside, on \nthe dark winter evening.  This knight said, in a strong voice, \n\'Follow me, loyal servants of the King!\'  The rattle of the armour \nof the other knights echoed through the Cathedral, as they came \nclashing in.\n\nIt was so dark, in the lofty aisles and among the stately pillars \nof the church, and there were so many hiding-places in the crypt \nbelow and in the narrow passages above, that Thomas a Becket might \neven at that pass have saved himself if he would.  But he would \nnot.  He told the monks resolutely that he would not.  And though \nthey all dispersed and left him there with no other follower than \nEDWARD GRYME, his faithful cross-bearer, he was as firm then, as \never he had been in his life.\n\nThe knights came on, through the darkness, making a terrible noise \nwith their armed tread upon the stone pavement of the church.  \n\'Where is the traitor?\' they cried out.  He made no answer.  But \nwhen they cried, \'Where is the Archbishop?\' he said proudly, \'I am \nhere!\' and came out of the shade and stood before them.\n\nThe knights had no desire to kill him, if they could rid the King \nand themselves of him by any other means.  They told him he must \neither fly or go with them.  He said he would do neither; and he \nthrew William Tracy off with such force when he took hold of his \nsleeve, that Tracy reeled again.  By his reproaches and his \nsteadiness, he so incensed them, and exasperated their fierce \nhumour, that Reginald Fitzurse, whom he called by an ill name, \nsaid, \'Then die!\' and struck at his head.  But the faithful Edward \nGryme put out his arm, and there received the main force of the \nblow, so that it only made his master bleed.  Another voice from \namong the knights again called to Thomas a Becket to fly; but, with \nhis blood running down his face, and his hands clasped, and his \nhead bent, he commanded himself to God, and stood firm.  Then they \ncruelly killed him close to the altar of St. Bennet; and his body \nfell upon the pavement, which was dirtied with his blood and \nbrains.\n\nIt is an awful thing to think of the murdered mortal, who had so \nshowered his curses about, lying, all disfigured, in the church, \nwhere a few lamps here and there were but red specks on a pall of \ndarkness; and to think of the guilty knights riding away on \nhorseback, looking over their shoulders at the dim Cathedral, and \nremembering what they had left inside.\n\n\nPART THE SECOND\n\n\nWHEN the King heard how Thomas a Becket had lost his life in \nCanterbury Cathedral, through the ferocity of the four Knights, he \nwas filled with dismay.  Some have supposed that when the King \nspoke those hasty words, \'Have I no one here who will deliver me \nfrom this man?\' he wished, and meant a Becket to be slain.  But few \nthings are more unlikely; for, besides that the King was not \nnaturally cruel (though very passionate), he was wise, and must \nhave known full well what any stupid man in his dominions must have \nknown, namely, that such a murder would rouse the Pope and the \nwhole Church against him.\n\nHe sent respectful messengers to the Pope, to represent his \ninnocence (except in having uttered the hasty words); and he swore \nsolemnly and publicly to his innocence, and contrived in time to \nmake his peace.  As to the four guilty Knights, who fled into \nYorkshire, and never again dared to show themselves at Court, the \nPope excommunicated them; and they lived miserably for some time, \nshunned by all their countrymen.  At last, they went humbly to \nJerusalem as a penance, and there died and were buried.\n\nIt happened, fortunately for the pacifying of the Pope, that an \nopportunity arose very soon after the murder of a Becket, for the \nKing to declare his power in Ireland - which was an acceptable \nundertaking to the Pope, as the Irish, who had been converted to \nChristianity by one Patricius (otherwise Saint Patrick) long ago, \nbefore any Pope existed, considered that the Pope had nothing at \nall to do with them, or they with the Pope, and accordingly refused \nto pay him Peter\'s Pence, or that tax of a penny a house which I \nhave elsewhere mentioned.  The King\'s opportunity arose in this \nway.\n\nThe Irish were, at that time, as barbarous a people as you can well \nimagine.  They were continually quarrelling and fighting, cutting \none another\'s throats, slicing one another\'s noses, burning one \nanother\'s houses, carrying away one another\'s wives, and committing \nall sorts of violence.  The country was divided into five kingdoms \n- DESMOND, THOMOND, CONNAUGHT, ULSTER, and LEINSTER - each governed \nby a separate King, of whom one claimed to be the chief of the \nrest.  Now, one of these Kings, named DERMOND MAC MURROUGH (a wild \nkind of name, spelt in more than one wild kind of way), had carried \noff the wife of a friend of his, and concealed her on an island in \na bog.  The friend resenting this (though it was quite the custom \nof the country), complained to the chief King, and, with the chief \nKing\'s help, drove Dermond Mac Murrough out of his dominions.  \nDermond came over to England for revenge; and offered to hold his \nrealm as a vassal of King Henry, if King Henry would help him to \nregain it.  The King consented to these terms; but only assisted \nhim, then, with what were called Letters Patent, authorising any \nEnglish subjects who were so disposed, to enter into his service, \nand aid his cause.\n\nThere was, at Bristol, a certain EARL RICHARD DE CLARE, called \nSTRONGBOW; of no very good character; needy and desperate, and \nready for anything that offered him a chance of improving his \nfortunes.  There were, in South Wales, two other broken knights of \nthe same good-for-nothing sort, called ROBERT FITZ-STEPHEN, and \nMAURICE FITZ-GERALD.  These three, each with a small band of \nfollowers, took up Dermond\'s cause; and it was agreed that if it \nproved successful, Strongbow should marry Dermond\'s daughter EVA, \nand be declared his heir.\n\nThe trained English followers of these knights were so superior in \nall the discipline of battle to the Irish, that they beat them \nagainst immense superiority of numbers.  In one fight, early in the \nwar, they cut off three hundred heads, and laid them before Mac \nMurrough; who turned them every one up with his hands, rejoicing, \nand, coming to one which was the head of a man whom he had much \ndisliked, grasped it by the hair and ears, and tore off the nose \nand lips with his teeth.  You may judge from this, what kind of a \ngentleman an Irish King in those times was.  The captives, all \nthrough this war, were horribly treated; the victorious party \nmaking nothing of breaking their limbs, and casting them into the \nsea from the tops of high rocks.  It was in the midst of the \nmiseries and cruelties attendant on the taking of Waterford, where \nthe dead lay piled in the streets, and the filthy gutters ran with \nblood, that Strongbow married Eva.  An odious marriage-company \nthose mounds of corpse\'s must have made, I think, and one quite \nworthy of the young lady\'s father.\n\nHe died, after Waterford and Dublin had been taken, and various \nsuccesses achieved; and Strongbow became King of Leinster.  Now \ncame King Henry\'s opportunity.  To restrain the growing power of \nStrongbow, he himself repaired to Dublin, as Strongbow\'s Royal \nMaster, and deprived him of his kingdom, but confirmed him in the \nenjoyment of great possessions.  The King, then, holding state in \nDublin, received the homage of nearly all the Irish Kings and \nChiefs, and so came home again with a great addition to his \nreputation as Lord of Ireland, and with a new claim on the favour \nof the Pope.  And now, their reconciliation was completed - more \neasily and mildly by the Pope, than the King might have expected, I \nthink.\n\nAt this period of his reign, when his troubles seemed so few and \nhis prospects so bright, those domestic miseries began which \ngradually made the King the most unhappy of men, reduced his great \nspirit, wore away his health, and broke his heart.\n\nHe had four sons.  HENRY, now aged eighteen - his secret crowning \nof whom had given such offence to Thomas a Becket.  RICHARD, aged \nsixteen; GEOFFREY, fifteen; and JOHN, his favourite, a young boy \nwhom the courtiers named LACKLAND, because he had no inheritance, \nbut to whom the King meant to give the Lordship of Ireland.  All \nthese misguided boys, in their turn, were unnatural sons to him, \nand unnatural brothers to each other.  Prince Henry, stimulated by \nthe French King, and by his bad mother, Queen Eleanor, began the \nundutiful history,\n\nFirst, he demanded that his young wife, MARGARET, the French King\'s \ndaughter, should be crowned as well as he.  His father, the King, \nconsented, and it was done.  It was no sooner done, than he \ndemanded to have a part of his father\'s dominions, during his \nfather\'s life.  This being refused, he made off from his father in \nthe night, with his bad heart full of bitterness, and took refuge \nat the French King\'s Court.  Within a day or two, his brothers \nRichard and Geoffrey followed.  Their mother tried to join them - \nescaping in man\'s clothes - but she was seized by King Henry\'s men, \nand immured in prison, where she lay, deservedly, for sixteen \nyears.  Every day, however, some grasping English noblemen, to whom \nthe King\'s protection of his people from their avarice and \noppression had given offence, deserted him and joined the Princes.  \nEvery day he heard some fresh intelligence of the Princes levying \narmies against him; of Prince Henry\'s wearing a crown before his \nown ambassadors at the French Court, and being called the Junior \nKing of England; of all the Princes swearing never to make peace \nwith him, their father, without the consent and approval of the \nBarons of France.  But, with his fortitude and energy unshaken, \nKing Henry met the shock of these disasters with a resolved and \ncheerful face.  He called upon all Royal fathers who had sons, to \nhelp him, for his cause was theirs; he hired, out of his riches, \ntwenty thousand men to fight the false French King, who stirred his \nown blood against him; and he carried on the war with such vigour, \nthat Louis soon proposed a conference to treat for peace.\n\nThe conference was held beneath an old wide-spreading green elm-\ntree, upon a plain in France.  It led to nothing.  The war \nrecommenced.  Prince Richard began his fighting career, by leading \nan army against his father; but his father beat him and his army \nback; and thousands of his men would have rued the day in which \nthey fought in such a wicked cause, had not the King received news \nof an invasion of England by the Scots, and promptly come home \nthrough a great storm to repress it.  And whether he really began \nto fear that he suffered these troubles because a Becket had been \nmurdered; or whether he wished to rise in the favour of the Pope, \nwho had now declared a Becket to be a saint, or in the favour of \nhis own people, of whom many believed that even a Becket\'s \nsenseless tomb could work miracles, I don\'t know:  but the King no \nsooner landed in England than he went straight to Canterbury; and \nwhen he came within sight of the distant Cathedral, he dismounted \nfrom his horse, took off his shoes, and walked with bare and \nbleeding feet to a Becket\'s grave.  There, he lay down on the \nground, lamenting, in the presence of many people; and by-and-by he \nwent into the Chapter House, and, removing his clothes from his \nback and shoulders, submitted himself to be beaten with knotted \ncords (not beaten very hard, I dare say though) by eighty Priests, \none after another.  It chanced that on the very day when the King \nmade this curious exhibition of himself, a complete victory was \nobtained over the Scots; which very much delighted the Priests, who \nsaid that it was won because of his great example of repentance.  \nFor the Priests in general had found out, since a Becket\'s death, \nthat they admired him of all things - though they had hated him \nvery cordially when he was alive.\n\nThe Earl of Flanders, who was at the head of the base conspiracy of \nthe King\'s undutiful sons and their foreign friends, took the \nopportunity of the King being thus employed at home, to lay siege \nto Rouen, the capital of Normandy.  But the King, who was \nextraordinarily quick and active in all his movements, was at \nRouen, too, before it was supposed possible that he could have left \nEngland; and there he so defeated the said Earl of Flanders, that \nthe conspirators proposed peace, and his bad sons Henry and \nGeoffrey submitted.  Richard resisted for six weeks; but, being \nbeaten out of castle after castle, he at last submitted too, and \nhis father forgave him.\n\nTo forgive these unworthy princes was only to afford them \nbreathing-time for new faithlessness.  They were so false, \ndisloyal, and dishonourable, that they were no more to be trusted \nthan common thieves.  In the very next year, Prince Henry rebelled \nagain, and was again forgiven.  In eight years more, Prince Richard \nrebelled against his elder brother; and Prince Geoffrey infamously \nsaid that the brothers could never agree well together, unless they \nwere united against their father.  In the very next year after \ntheir reconciliation by the King, Prince Henry again rebelled \nagainst his father; and again submitted, swearing to be true; and \nwas again forgiven; and again rebelled with Geoffrey.\n\nBut the end of this perfidious Prince was come.  He fell sick at a \nFrench town; and his conscience terribly reproaching him with his \nbaseness, he sent messengers to the King his father, imploring him \nto come and see him, and to forgive him for the last time on his \nbed of death.  The generous King, who had a royal and forgiving \nmind towards his children always, would have gone; but this Prince \nhad been so unnatural, that the noblemen about the King suspected \ntreachery, and represented to him that he could not safely trust \nhis life with such a traitor, though his own eldest son.  Therefore \nthe King sent him a ring from off his finger as a token of \nforgiveness; and when the Prince had kissed it, with much grief and \nmany tears, and had confessed to those around him how bad, and \nwicked, and undutiful a son he had been; he said to the attendant \nPriests:  \'O, tie a rope about my body, and draw me out of bed, and \nlay me down upon a bed of ashes, that I may die with prayers to God \nin a repentant manner!\'  And so he died, at twenty-seven years old.\n\nThree years afterwards, Prince Geoffrey, being unhorsed at a \ntournament, had his brains trampled out by a crowd of horses \npassing over him.  So, there only remained Prince Richard, and \nPrince John - who had grown to be a young man now, and had solemnly \nsworn to be faithful to his father.  Richard soon rebelled again, \nencouraged by his friend the French King, PHILIP THE SECOND (son of \nLouis, who was dead); and soon submitted and was again forgiven, \nswearing on the New Testament never to rebel again; and in another \nyear or so, rebelled again; and, in the presence of his father, \nknelt down on his knee before the King of France; and did the \nFrench King homage:  and declared that with his aid he would \npossess himself, by force, of all his father\'s French dominions.\n\nAnd yet this Richard called himself a soldier of Our Saviour!  And \nyet this Richard wore the Cross, which the Kings of France and \nEngland had both taken, in the previous year, at a brotherly \nmeeting underneath the old wide-spreading elm-tree on the plain, \nwhen they had sworn (like him) to devote themselves to a new \nCrusade, for the love and honour of the Truth!\n\nSick at heart, wearied out by the falsehood of his sons, and almost \nready to lie down and die, the unhappy King who had so long stood \nfirm, began to fail.  But the Pope, to his honour, supported him; \nand obliged the French King and Richard, though successful in \nfight, to treat for peace.  Richard wanted to be Crowned King of \nEngland, and pretended that he wanted to be married (which he \nreally did not) to the French King\'s sister, his promised wife, \nwhom King Henry detained in England.  King Henry wanted, on the \nother hand, that the French King\'s sister should be married to his \nfavourite son, John:  the only one of his sons (he said) who had \nnever rebelled against him.  At last King Henry, deserted by his \nnobles one by one, distressed, exhausted, broken-hearted, consented \nto establish peace.\n\nOne final heavy sorrow was reserved for him, even yet.  When they \nbrought him the proposed treaty of peace, in writing, as he lay \nvery ill in bed, they brought him also the list of the deserters \nfrom their allegiance, whom he was required to pardon.  The first \nname upon this list was John, his favourite son, in whom he had \ntrusted to the last.\n\n\'O John! child of my heart!\' exclaimed the King, in a great agony \nof mind.  \'O John, whom I have loved the best!  O John, for whom I \nhave contended through these many troubles!  Have you betrayed me \ntoo!\'  And then he lay down with a heavy groan, and said, \'Now let \nthe world go as it will.  I care for nothing more!\'\n\nAfter a time, he told his attendants to take him to the French town \nof Chinon - a town he had been fond of, during many years.  But he \nwas fond of no place now; it was too true that he could care for \nnothing more upon this earth.  He wildly cursed the hour when he \nwas born, and cursed the children whom he left behind him; and \nexpired.\n\nAs, one hundred years before, the servile followers of the Court \nhad abandoned the Conqueror in the hour of his death, so they now \nabandoned his descendant.  The very body was stripped, in the \nplunder of the Royal chamber; and it was not easy to find the means \nof carrying it for burial to the abbey church of Fontevraud.\n\nRichard was said in after years, by way of flattery, to have the \nheart of a Lion.  It would have been far better, I think, to have \nhad the heart of a Man.  His heart, whatever it was, had cause to \nbeat remorsefully within his breast, when he came - as he did - \ninto the solemn abbey, and looked on his dead father\'s uncovered \nface.  His heart, whatever it was, had been a black and perjured \nheart, in all its dealings with the deceased King, and more \ndeficient in a single touch of tenderness than any wild beast\'s in \nthe forest.\n\nThere is a pretty story told of this Reign, called the story of \nFAIR ROSAMOND.  It relates how the King doted on Fair Rosamond, who \nwas the loveliest girl in all the world; and how he had a beautiful \nBower built for her in a Park at Woodstock; and how it was erected \nin a labyrinth, and could only be found by a clue of silk.  How the \nbad Queen Eleanor, becoming jealous of Fair Rosamond, found out the \nsecret of the clue, and one day, appeared before her, with a dagger \nand a cup of poison, and left her to the choice between those \ndeaths.  How Fair Rosamond, after shedding many piteous tears and \noffering many useless prayers to the cruel Queen, took the poison, \nand fell dead in the midst of the beautiful bower, while the \nunconscious birds sang gaily all around her.\n\nNow, there WAS a fair Rosamond, and she was (I dare say) the \nloveliest girl in all the world, and the King was certainly very \nfond of her, and the bad Queen Eleanor was certainly made jealous.  \nBut I am afraid - I say afraid, because I like the story so much - \nthat there was no bower, no labyrinth, no silken clue, no dagger, \nno poison.  I am afraid fair Rosamond retired to a nunnery near \nOxford, and died there, peaceably; her sister-nuns hanging a silken \ndrapery over her tomb, and often dressing it with flowers, in \nremembrance of the youth and beauty that had enchanted the King \nwhen he too was young, and when his life lay fair before him.\n\nIt was dark and ended now; faded and gone.  Henry Plantagenet lay \nquiet in the abbey church of Fontevraud, in the fifty-seventh year \nof his age - never to be completed - after governing England well, \nfor nearly thirty-five years.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII - ENGLAND UNDER RICHARD THE FIRST, CALLED THE LION-\nHEART\n\n\n\nIN the year of our Lord one thousand one hundred and eighty-nine, \nRichard of the Lion Heart succeeded to the throne of King Henry the \nSecond, whose paternal heart he had done so much to break.  He had \nbeen, as we have seen, a rebel from his boyhood; but, the moment he \nbecame a king against whom others might rebel, he found out that \nrebellion was a great wickedness.  In the heat of this pious \ndiscovery, he punished all the leading people who had befriended \nhim against his father.  He could scarcely have done anything that \nwould have been a better instance of his real nature, or a better \nwarning to fawners and parasites not to trust in lion-hearted \nprinces.\n\nHe likewise put his late father\'s treasurer in chains, and locked \nhim up in a dungeon from which he was not set free until he had \nrelinquished, not only all the Crown treasure, but all his own \nmoney too.  So, Richard certainly got the Lion\'s share of the \nwealth of this wretched treasurer, whether he had a Lion\'s heart or \nnot.\n\nHe was crowned King of England, with great pomp, at Westminster:  \nwalking to the Cathedral under a silken canopy stretched on the \ntops of four lances, each carried by a great lord.  On the day of \nhis coronation, a dreadful murdering of the Jews took place, which \nseems to have given great delight to numbers of savage persons \ncalling themselves Christians.  The King had issued a proclamation \nforbidding the Jews (who were generally hated, though they were the \nmost useful merchants in England) to appear at the ceremony; but as \nthey had assembled in London from all parts, bringing presents to \nshow their respect for the new Sovereign, some of them ventured \ndown to Westminster Hall with their gifts; which were very readily \naccepted.  It is supposed, now, that some noisy fellow in the \ncrowd, pretending to be a very delicate Christian, set up a howl at \nthis, and struck a Jew who was trying to get in at the Hall door \nwith his present.  A riot arose.  The Jews who had got into the \nHall, were driven forth; and some of the rabble cried out that the \nnew King had commanded the unbelieving race to be put to death.  \nThereupon the crowd rushed through the narrow streets of the city, \nslaughtering all the Jews they met; and when they could find no \nmore out of doors (on account of their having fled to their houses, \nand fastened themselves in), they ran madly about, breaking open \nall the houses where the Jews lived, rushing in and stabbing or \nspearing them, sometimes even flinging old people and children out \nof window into blazing fires they had lighted up below.  This great \ncruelty lasted four-and-twenty hours, and only three men were \npunished for it.  Even they forfeited their lives not for murdering \nand robbing the Jews, but for burning the houses of some \nChristians.\n\nKing Richard, who was a strong, restless, burly man, with one idea \nalways in his head, and that the very troublesome idea of breaking \nthe heads of other men, was mightily impatient to go on a Crusade \nto the Holy Land, with a great army.  As great armies could not be \nraised to go, even to the Holy Land, without a great deal of money, \nhe sold the Crown domains, and even the high offices of State; \nrecklessly appointing noblemen to rule over his English subjects, \nnot because they were fit to govern, but because they could pay \nhigh for the privilege.  In this way, and by selling pardons at a \ndear rate and by varieties of avarice and oppression, he scraped \ntogether a large treasure.  He then appointed two Bishops to take \ncare of his kingdom in his absence, and gave great powers and \npossessions to his brother John, to secure his friendship.  John \nwould rather have been made Regent of England; but he was a sly \nman, and friendly to the expedition; saying to himself, no doubt, \n\'The more fighting, the more chance of my brother being killed; and \nwhen he IS killed, then I become King John!\'\n\nBefore the newly levied army departed from England, the recruits \nand the general populace distinguished themselves by astonishing \ncruelties on the unfortunate Jews:  whom, in many large towns, they \nmurdered by hundreds in the most horrible manner.\n\nAt York, a large body of Jews took refuge in the Castle, in the \nabsence of its Governor, after the wives and children of many of \nthem had been slain before their eyes.  Presently came the \nGovernor, and demanded admission.  \'How can we give it thee, O \nGovernor!\' said the Jews upon the walls, \'when, if we open the gate \nby so much as the width of a foot, the roaring crowd behind thee \nwill press in and kill us?\'\n\nUpon this, the unjust Governor became angry, and told the people \nthat he approved of their killing those Jews; and a mischievous \nmaniac of a friar, dressed all in white, put himself at the head of \nthe assault, and they assaulted the Castle for three days.\n\nThen said JOCEN, the head-Jew (who was a Rabbi or Priest), to the \nrest, \'Brethren, there is no hope for us with the Christians who \nare hammering at the gates and walls, and who must soon break in.  \nAs we and our wives and children must die, either by Christian \nhands, or by our own, let it be by our own.  Let us destroy by fire \nwhat jewels and other treasure we have here, then fire the castle, \nand then perish!\'\n\nA few could not resolve to do this, but the greater part complied.  \nThey made a blazing heap of all their valuables, and, when those \nwere consumed, set the castle in flames.  While the flames roared \nand crackled around them, and shooting up into the sky, turned it \nblood-red, Jocen cut the throat of his beloved wife, and stabbed \nhimself.  All the others who had wives or children, did the like \ndreadful deed.  When the populace broke in, they found (except the \ntrembling few, cowering in corners, whom they soon killed) only \nheaps of greasy cinders, with here and there something like part of \nthe blackened trunk of a burnt tree, but which had lately been a \nhuman creature, formed by the beneficent hand of the Creator as \nthey were.\n\nAfter this bad beginning, Richard and his troops went on, in no \nvery good manner, with the Holy Crusade.  It was undertaken jointly \nby the King of England and his old friend Philip of France.  They \ncommenced the business by reviewing their forces, to the number of \none hundred thousand men.  Afterwards, they severally embarked \ntheir troops for Messina, in Sicily, which was appointed as the \nnext place of meeting.\n\nKing Richard\'s sister had married the King of this place, but he \nwas dead:  and his uncle TANCRED had usurped the crown, cast the \nRoyal Widow into prison, and possessed himself of her estates.  \nRichard fiercely demanded his sister\'s release, the restoration of \nher lands, and (according to the Royal custom of the Island) that \nshe should have a golden chair, a golden table, four-and-twenty \nsilver cups, and four-and-twenty silver dishes.  As he was too \npowerful to be successfully resisted, Tancred yielded to his \ndemands; and then the French King grew jealous, and complained that \nthe English King wanted to be absolute in the Island of Messina and \neverywhere else.  Richard, however, cared little or nothing for \nthis complaint; and in consideration of a present of twenty \nthousand pieces of gold, promised his pretty little nephew ARTHUR, \nthen a child of two years old, in marriage to Tancred\'s daughter.  \nWe shall hear again of pretty little Arthur by-and-by.\n\nThis Sicilian affair arranged without anybody\'s brains being \nknocked out (which must have rather disappointed him), King Richard \ntook his sister away, and also a fair lady named BERENGARIA, with \nwhom he had fallen in love in France, and whom his mother, Queen \nEleanor (so long in prison, you remember, but released by Richard \non his coming to the Throne), had brought out there to be his wife; \nand sailed with them for Cyprus.\n\nHe soon had the pleasure of fighting the King of the Island of \nCyprus, for allowing his subjects to pillage some of the English \ntroops who were shipwrecked on the shore; and easily conquering \nthis poor monarch, he seized his only daughter, to be a companion \nto the lady Berengaria, and put the King himself into silver \nfetters.  He then sailed away again with his mother, sister, wife, \nand the captive princess; and soon arrived before the town of Acre, \nwhich the French King with his fleet was besieging from the sea.  \nBut the French King was in no triumphant condition, for his army \nhad been thinned by the swords of the Saracens, and wasted by the \nplague; and SALADIN, the brave Sultan of the Turks, at the head of \na numerous army, was at that time gallantly defending the place \nfrom the hills that rise above it.\n\nWherever the united army of Crusaders went, they agreed in few \npoints except in gaming, drinking, and quarrelling, in a most \nunholy manner; in debauching the people among whom they tarried, \nwhether they were friends or foes; and in carrying disturbance and \nruin into quiet places.  The French King was jealous of the English \nKing, and the English King was jealous of the French King, and the \ndisorderly and violent soldiers of the two nations were jealous of \none another; consequently, the two Kings could not at first agree, \neven upon a joint assault on Acre; but when they did make up their \nquarrel for that purpose, the Saracens promised to yield the town, \nto give up to the Christians the wood of the Holy Cross, to set at \nliberty all their Christian captives, and to pay two hundred \nthousand pieces of gold.  All this was to be done within forty \ndays; but, not being done, King Richard ordered some three thousand \nSaracen prisoners to be brought out in the front of his camp, and \nthere, in full view of their own countrymen, to be butchered.\n\nThe French King had no part in this crime; for he was by that time \ntravelling homeward with the greater part of his men; being \noffended by the overbearing conduct of the English King; being \nanxious to look after his own dominions; and being ill, besides, \nfrom the unwholesome air of that hot and sandy country.  King \nRichard carried on the war without him; and remained in the East, \nmeeting with a variety of adventures, nearly a year and a half.  \nEvery night when his army was on the march, and came to a halt, the \nheralds cried out three times, to remind all the soldiers of the \ncause in which they were engaged, \'Save the Holy Sepulchre!\' and \nthen all the soldiers knelt and said \'Amen!\'  Marching or \nencamping, the army had continually to strive with the hot air of \nthe glaring desert, or with the Saracen soldiers animated and \ndirected by the brave Saladin, or with both together.  Sickness and \ndeath, battle and wounds, were always among them; but through every \ndifficulty King Richard fought like a giant, and worked like a \ncommon labourer.  Long and long after he was quiet in his grave, \nhis terrible battle-axe, with twenty English pounds of English \nsteel in its mighty head, was a legend among the Saracens; and when \nall the Saracen and Christian hosts had been dust for many a year, \nif a Saracen horse started at any object by the wayside, his rider \nwould exclaim, \'What dost thou fear, Fool?  Dost thou think King \nRichard is behind it?\'\n\nNo one admired this King\'s renown for bravery more than Saladin \nhimself, who was a generous and gallant enemy.  When Richard lay \nill of a fever, Saladin sent him fresh fruits from Damascus, and \nsnow from the mountain-tops.  Courtly messages and compliments were \nfrequently exchanged between them - and then King Richard would \nmount his horse and kill as many Saracens as he could; and Saladin \nwould mount his, and kill as many Christians as he could.  In this \nway King Richard fought to his heart\'s content at Arsoof and at \nJaffa; and finding himself with nothing exciting to do at Ascalon, \nexcept to rebuild, for his own defence, some fortifications there \nwhich the Saracens had destroyed, he kicked his ally the Duke of \nAustria, for being too proud to work at them.\n\nThe army at last came within sight of the Holy City of Jerusalem; \nbut, being then a mere nest of jealousy, and quarrelling and \nfighting, soon retired, and agreed with the Saracens upon a truce \nfor three years, three months, three days, and three hours.  Then, \nthe English Christians, protected by the noble Saladin from Saracen \nrevenge, visited Our Saviour\'s tomb; and then King Richard embarked \nwith a small force at Acre to return home.\n\nBut he was shipwrecked in the Adriatic Sea, and was fain to pass \nthrough Germany, under an assumed name.  Now, there were many \npeople in Germany who had served in the Holy Land under that proud \nDuke of Austria who had been kicked; and some of them, easily \nrecognising a man so remarkable as King Richard, carried their \nintelligence to the kicked Duke, who straightway took him prisoner \nat a little inn near Vienna.\n\nThe Duke\'s master the Emperor of Germany, and the King of France, \nwere equally delighted to have so troublesome a monarch in safe \nkeeping.  Friendships which are founded on a partnership in doing \nwrong, are never true; and the King of France was now quite as \nheartily King Richard\'s foe, as he had ever been his friend in his \nunnatural conduct to his father.  He monstrously pretended that \nKing Richard had designed to poison him in the East; he charged him \nwith having murdered, there, a man whom he had in truth befriended; \nhe bribed the Emperor of Germany to keep him close prisoner; and, \nfinally, through the plotting of these two princes, Richard was \nbrought before the German legislature, charged with the foregoing \ncrimes, and many others.  But he defended himself so well, that \nmany of the assembly were moved to tears by his eloquence and \nearnestness.  It was decided that he should be treated, during the \nrest of his captivity, in a manner more becoming his dignity than \nhe had been, and that he should be set free on the payment of a \nheavy ransom.  This ransom the English people willingly raised.  \nWhen Queen Eleanor took it over to Germany, it was at first evaded \nand refused.  But she appealed to the honour of all the princes of \nthe German Empire in behalf of her son, and appealed so well that \nit was accepted, and the King released.  Thereupon, the King of \nFrance wrote to Prince John - \'Take care of thyself.  The devil is \nunchained!\'\n\nPrince John had reason to fear his brother, for he had been a \ntraitor to him in his captivity.  He had secretly joined the French \nKing; had vowed to the English nobles and people that his brother \nwas dead; and had vainly tried to seize the crown.  He was now in \nFrance, at a place called Evreux.  Being the meanest and basest of \nmen, he contrived a mean and base expedient for making himself \nacceptable to his brother.  He invited the French officers of the \ngarrison in that town to dinner, murdered them all, and then took \nthe fortress.  With this recommendation to the good will of a lion-\nhearted monarch, he hastened to King Richard, fell on his knees \nbefore him, and obtained the intercession of Queen Eleanor.  \'I \nforgive him,\' said the King, \'and I hope I may forget the injury he \nhas done me, as easily as I know he will forget my pardon.\'\n\nWhile King Richard was in Sicily, there had been trouble in his \ndominions at home:  one of the bishops whom he had left in charge \nthereof, arresting the other; and making, in his pride and \nambition, as great a show as if he were King himself.  But the King \nhearing of it at Messina, and appointing a new Regency, this \nLONGCHAMP (for that was his name) had fled to France in a woman\'s \ndress, and had there been encouraged and supported by the French \nKing.  With all these causes of offence against Philip in his mind, \nKing Richard had no sooner been welcomed home by his enthusiastic \nsubjects with great display and splendour, and had no sooner been \ncrowned afresh at Winchester, than he resolved to show the French \nKing that the Devil was unchained indeed, and made war against him \nwith great fury.\n\nThere was fresh trouble at home about this time, arising out of the \ndiscontents of the poor people, who complained that they were far \nmore heavily taxed than the rich, and who found a spirited champion \nin WILLIAM FITZ-OSBERT, called LONGBEARD.  He became the leader of \na secret society, comprising fifty thousand men; he was seized by \nsurprise; he stabbed the citizen who first laid hands upon him; and \nretreated, bravely fighting, to a church, which he maintained four \ndays, until he was dislodged by fire, and run through the body as \nhe came out.  He was not killed, though; for he was dragged, half \ndead, at the tail of a horse to Smithfield, and there hanged.  \nDeath was long a favourite remedy for silencing the people\'s \nadvocates; but as we go on with this history, I fancy we shall find \nthem difficult to make an end of, for all that.\n\nThe French war, delayed occasionally by a truce, was still in \nprogress when a certain Lord named VIDOMAR, Viscount of Limoges, \nchanced to find in his ground a treasure of ancient coins.  As the \nKing\'s vassal, he sent the King half of it; but the King claimed \nthe whole.  The lord refused to yield the whole.  The King besieged \nthe lord in his castle, swore that he would take the castle by \nstorm, and hang every man of its defenders on the battlements.\n\nThere was a strange old song in that part of the country, to the \neffect that in Limoges an arrow would be made by which King Richard \nwould die.  It may be that BERTRAND DE GOURDON, a young man who was \none of the defenders of the castle, had often sung it or heard it \nsung of a winter night, and remembered it when he saw, from his \npost upon the ramparts, the King attended only by his chief officer \nriding below the walls surveying the place.  He drew an arrow to \nthe head, took steady aim, said between his teeth, \'Now I pray God \nspeed thee well, arrow!\' discharged it, and struck the King in the \nleft shoulder.\n\nAlthough the wound was not at first considered dangerous, it was \nsevere enough to cause the King to retire to his tent, and direct \nthe assault to be made without him.  The castle was taken; and \nevery man of its defenders was hanged, as the King had sworn all \nshould be, except Bertrand de Gourdon, who was reserved until the \nroyal pleasure respecting him should be known.\n\nBy that time unskilful treatment had made the wound mortal and the \nKing knew that he was dying.  He directed Bertrand to be brought \ninto his tent.  The young man was brought there, heavily chained, \nKing Richard looked at him steadily.  He looked, as steadily, at \nthe King.\n\n\'Knave!\' said King Richard.  \'What have I done to thee that thou \nshouldest take my life?\'\n\n\'What hast thou done to me?\' replied the young man.  \'With thine \nown hands thou hast killed my father and my two brothers.  Myself \nthou wouldest have hanged.  Let me die now, by any torture that \nthou wilt.  My comfort is, that no torture can save Thee.  Thou too \nmust die; and, through me, the world is quit of thee!\'\n\nAgain the King looked at the young man steadily.  Again the young \nman looked steadily at him.  Perhaps some remembrance of his \ngenerous enemy Saladin, who was not a Christian, came into the mind \nof the dying King.\n\n\'Youth!\' he said, \'I forgive thee.  Go unhurt!\'  Then, turning to \nthe chief officer who had been riding in his company when he \nreceived the wound, King Richard said:\n\n\'Take off his chains, give him a hundred shillings, and let him \ndepart.\'\n\nHe sunk down on his couch, and a dark mist seemed in his weakened \neyes to fill the tent wherein he had so often rested, and he died.  \nHis age was forty-two; he had reigned ten years.  His last command \nwas not obeyed; for the chief officer flayed Bertrand de Gourdon \nalive, and hanged him.\n\nThere is an old tune yet known - a sorrowful air will sometimes \noutlive many generations of strong men, and even last longer than \nbattle-axes with twenty pounds of steel in the head - by which this \nKing is said to have been discovered in his captivity.  BLONDEL, a \nfavourite Minstrel of King Richard, as the story relates, \nfaithfully seeking his Royal master, went singing it outside the \ngloomy walls of many foreign fortresses and prisons; until at last \nhe heard it echoed from within a dungeon, and knew the voice, and \ncried out in ecstasy, \'O Richard, O my King!\'  You may believe it, \nif you like; it would be easy to believe worse things.  Richard was \nhimself a Minstrel and a Poet.  If he had not been a Prince too, he \nmight have been a better man perhaps, and might have gone out of \nthe world with less bloodshed and waste of life to answer for.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV - ENGLAND UNDER KING JOHN, CALLED LACKLAND\n\n\n\nAT two-and-thirty years of age, JOHN became King of England.  His \npretty little nephew ARTHUR had the best claim to the throne; but \nJohn seized the treasure, and made fine promises to the nobility, \nand got himself crowned at Westminster within a few weeks after his \nbrother Richard\'s death.  I doubt whether the crown could possibly \nhave been put upon the head of a meaner coward, or a more \ndetestable villain, if England had been searched from end to end to \nfind him out.\n\nThe French King, Philip, refused to acknowledge the right of John \nto his new dignity, and declared in favour of Arthur.  You must not \nsuppose that he had any generosity of feeling for the fatherless \nboy; it merely suited his ambitious schemes to oppose the King of \nEngland.  So John and the French King went to war about Arthur.\n\nHe was a handsome boy, at that time only twelve years old.  He was \nnot born when his father, Geoffrey, had his brains trampled out at \nthe tournament; and, besides the misfortune of never having known a \nfather\'s guidance and protection, he had the additional misfortune \nto have a foolish mother (CONSTANCE by name), lately married to her \nthird husband.  She took Arthur, upon John\'s accession, to the \nFrench King, who pretended to be very much his friend, and who made \nhim a Knight, and promised him his daughter in marriage; but, who \ncared so little about him in reality, that finding it his interest \nto make peace with King John for a time, he did so without the \nleast consideration for the poor little Prince, and heartlessly \nsacrificed all his interests.\n\nYoung Arthur, for two years afterwards, lived quietly; and in the \ncourse of that time his mother died.  But, the French King then \nfinding it his interest to quarrel with King John again, again made \nArthur his pretence, and invited the orphan boy to court.  \'You \nknow your rights, Prince,\' said the French King, \'and you would \nlike to be a King.  Is it not so?\'  \'Truly,\' said Prince Arthur, \'I \nshould greatly like to be a King!\'  \'Then,\' said Philip, \'you shall \nhave two hundred gentlemen who are Knights of mine, and with them \nyou shall go to win back the provinces belonging to you, of which \nyour uncle, the usurping King of England, has taken possession.  I \nmyself, meanwhile, will head a force against him in Normandy.\'  \nPoor Arthur was so flattered and so grateful that he signed a \ntreaty with the crafty French King, agreeing to consider him his \nsuperior Lord, and that the French King should keep for himself \nwhatever he could take from King John.\n\nNow, King John was so bad in all ways, and King Philip was so \nperfidious, that Arthur, between the two, might as well have been a \nlamb between a fox and a wolf.  But, being so young, he was ardent \nand flushed with hope; and, when the people of Brittany (which was \nhis inheritance) sent him five hundred more knights and five \nthousand foot soldiers, he believed his fortune was made.  The \npeople of Brittany had been fond of him from his birth, and had \nrequested that he might be called Arthur, in remembrance of that \ndimly-famous English Arthur, of whom I told you early in this book, \nwhom they believed to have been the brave friend and companion of \nan old King of their own.  They had tales among them about a \nprophet called MERLIN (of the same old time), who had foretold that \ntheir own King should be restored to them after hundreds of years; \nand they believed that the prophecy would be fulfilled in Arthur; \nthat the time would come when he would rule them with a crown of \nBrittany upon his head; and when neither King of France nor King of \nEngland would have any power over them.  When Arthur found himself \nriding in a glittering suit of armour on a richly caparisoned \nhorse, at the head of his train of knights and soldiers, he began \nto believe this too, and to consider old Merlin a very superior \nprophet.\n\nHe did not know - how could he, being so innocent and \ninexperienced? - that his little army was a mere nothing against \nthe power of the King of England.  The French King knew it; but the \npoor boy\'s fate was little to him, so that the King of England was \nworried and distressed.  Therefore, King Philip went his way into \nNormandy and Prince Arthur went his way towards Mirebeau, a French \ntown near Poictiers, both very well pleased.\n\nPrince Arthur went to attack the town of Mirebeau, because his \ngrandmother Eleanor, who has so often made her appearance in this \nhistory (and who had always been his mother\'s enemy), was living \nthere, and because his Knights said, \'Prince, if you can take her \nprisoner, you will be able to bring the King your uncle to terms!\'  \nBut she was not to be easily taken.  She was old enough by this \ntime - eighty - but she was as full of stratagem as she was full of \nyears and wickedness.  Receiving intelligence of young Arthur\'s \napproach, she shut herself up in a high tower, and encouraged her \nsoldiers to defend it like men.  Prince Arthur with his little army \nbesieged the high tower.  King John, hearing how matters stood, \ncame up to the rescue, with HIS army.  So here was a strange \nfamily-party!  The boy-Prince besieging his grandmother, and his \nuncle besieging him!\n\nThis position of affairs did not last long.  One summer night King \nJohn, by treachery, got his men into the town, surprised Prince \nArthur\'s force, took two hundred of his knights, and seized the \nPrince himself in his bed.  The Knights were put in heavy irons, \nand driven away in open carts drawn by bullocks, to various \ndungeons where they were most inhumanly treated, and where some of \nthem were starved to death.  Prince Arthur was sent to the castle \nof Falaise.\n\nOne day, while he was in prison at that castle, mournfully thinking \nit strange that one so young should be in so much trouble, and \nlooking out of the small window in the deep dark wall, at the \nsummer sky and the birds, the door was softly opened, and he saw \nhis uncle the King standing in the shadow of the archway, looking \nvery grim.\n\n\'Arthur,\' said the King, with his wicked eyes more on the stone \nfloor than on his nephew, \'will you not trust to the gentleness, \nthe friendship, and the truthfulness of your loving uncle?\'\n\n\'I will tell my loving uncle that,\' replied the boy, \'when he does \nme right.  Let him restore to me my kingdom of England, and then \ncome to me and ask the question.\'\n\nThe King looked at him and went out.  \'Keep that boy close \nprisoner,\' said he to the warden of the castle.\n\nThen, the King took secret counsel with the worst of his nobles how \nthe Prince was to be got rid of.  Some said, \'Put out his eyes and \nkeep him in prison, as Robort of Normandy was kept.\'  Others said, \n\'Have him stabbed.\'  Others, \'Have him hanged.\'  Others, \'Have him \npoisoned.\'\n\nKing John, feeling that in any case, whatever was done afterwards, \nit would be a satisfaction to his mind to have those handsome eyes \nburnt out that had looked at him so proudly while his own royal \neyes were blinking at the stone floor, sent certain ruffians to \nFalaise to blind the boy with red-hot irons.  But Arthur so \npathetically entreated them, and shed such piteous tears, and so \nappealed to HUBERT DE BOURG (or BURGH), the warden of the castle, \nwho had a love for him, and was an honourable, tender man, that \nHubert could not bear it.  To his eternal honour he prevented the \ntorture from being performed, and, at his own risk, sent the \nsavages away.\n\nThe chafed and disappointed King bethought himself of the stabbing \nsuggestion next, and, with his shuffling manner and his cruel face, \nproposed it to one William de Bray.  \'I am a gentleman and not an \nexecutioner,\' said William de Bray, and left the presence with \ndisdain.\n\nBut it was not difficult for a King to hire a murderer in those \ndays.  King John found one for his money, and sent him down to the \ncastle of Falaise.  \'On what errand dost thou come?\' said Hubert to \nthis fellow.  \'To despatch young Arthur,\' he returned.  \'Go back to \nhim who sent thee,\' answered Hubert, \'and say that I will do it!\'\n\nKing John very well knowing that Hubert would never do it, but that \nhe courageously sent this reply to save the Prince or gain time, \ndespatched messengers to convey the young prisoner to the castle of \nRouen.\n\nArthur was soon forced from the good Hubert - of whom he had never \nstood in greater need than then - carried away by night, and lodged \nin his new prison:  where, through his grated window, he could hear \nthe deep waters of the river Seine, rippling against the stone wall \nbelow.\n\nOne dark night, as he lay sleeping, dreaming perhaps of rescue by \nthose unfortunate gentlemen who were obscurely suffering and dying \nin his cause, he was roused, and bidden by his jailer to come down \nthe staircase to the foot of the tower.  He hurriedly dressed \nhimself and obeyed.  When they came to the bottom of the winding \nstairs, and the night air from the river blew upon their faces, the \njailer trod upon his torch and put it out.  Then, Arthur, in the \ndarkness, was hurriedly drawn into a solitary boat.  And in that \nboat, he found his uncle and one other man.\n\nHe knelt to them, and prayed them not to murder him.  Deaf to his \nentreaties, they stabbed him and sunk his body in the river with \nheavy stones.  When the spring-morning broke, the tower-door was \nclosed, the boat was gone, the river sparkled on its way, and never \nmore was any trace of the poor boy beheld by mortal eyes.\n\nThe news of this atrocious murder being spread in England, awakened \na hatred of the King (already odious for his many vices, and for \nhis having stolen away and married a noble lady while his own wife \nwas living) that never slept again through his whole reign.  In \nBrittany, the indignation was intense.  Arthur\'s own sister ELEANOR \nwas in the power of John and shut up in a convent at Bristol, but \nhis half-sister ALICE was in Brittany.  The people chose her, and \nthe murdered prince\'s father-in-law, the last husband of Constance, \nto represent them; and carried their fiery complaints to King \nPhilip.  King Philip summoned King John (as the holder of territory \nin France) to come before him and defend himself.  King John \nrefusing to appear, King Philip declared him false, perjured, and \nguilty; and again made war.  In a little time, by conquering the \ngreater part of his French territory, King Philip deprived him of \none-third of his dominions.  And, through all the fighting that \ntook place, King John was always found, either to be eating and \ndrinking, like a gluttonous fool, when the danger was at a \ndistance, or to be running away, like a beaten cur, when it was \nnear.\n\nYou might suppose that when he was losing his dominions at this \nrate, and when his own nobles cared so little for him or his cause \nthat they plainly refused to follow his banner out of England, he \nhad enemies enough.  But he made another enemy of the Pope, which \nhe did in this way.\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury dying, and the junior monks of that \nplace wishing to get the start of the senior monks in the \nappointment of his successor, met together at midnight, secretly \nelected a certain REGINALD, and sent him off to Rome to get the \nPope\'s approval.  The senior monks and the King soon finding this \nout, and being very angry about it, the junior monks gave way, and \nall the monks together elected the Bishop of Norwich, who was the \nKing\'s favourite.  The Pope, hearing the whole story, declared that \nneither election would do for him, and that HE elected STEPHEN \nLANGTON.  The monks submitting to the Pope, the King turned them \nall out bodily, and banished them as traitors.  The Pope sent three \nbishops to the King, to threaten him with an Interdict.  The King \ntold the bishops that if any Interdict were laid upon his kingdom, \nhe would tear out the eyes and cut off the noses of all the monks \nhe could lay hold of, and send them over to Rome in that \nundecorated state as a present for their master.  The bishops, \nnevertheless, soon published the Interdict, and fled.\n\nAfter it had lasted a year, the Pope proceeded to his next step; \nwhich was Excommunication.  King John was declared excommunicated, \nwith all the usual ceremonies.  The King was so incensed at this, \nand was made so desperate by the disaffection of his Barons and the \nhatred of his people, that it is said he even privately sent \nambassadors to the Turks in Spain, offering to renounce his \nreligion and hold his kingdom of them if they would help him.  It \nis related that the ambassadors were admitted to the presence of \nthe Turkish Emir through long lines of Moorish guards, and that \nthey found the Emir with his eyes seriously fixed on the pages of a \nlarge book, from which he never once looked up.  That they gave him \na letter from the King containing his proposals, and were gravely \ndismissed.  That presently the Emir sent for one of them, and \nconjured him, by his faith in his religion, to say what kind of man \nthe King of England truly was?  That the ambassador, thus pressed, \nreplied that the King of England was a false tyrant, against whom \nhis own subjects would soon rise.  And that this was quite enough \nfor the Emir.\n\nMoney being, in his position, the next best thing to men, King John \nspared no means of getting it.  He set on foot another oppressing \nand torturing of the unhappy Jews (which was quite in his way), and \ninvented a new punishment for one wealthy Jew of Bristol.  Until \nsuch time as that Jew should produce a certain large sum of money, \nthe King sentenced him to be imprisoned, and, every day, to have \none tooth violently wrenched out of his head - beginning with the \ndouble teeth.  For seven days, the oppressed man bore the daily \npain and lost the daily tooth; but, on the eighth, he paid the \nmoney.  With the treasure raised in such ways, the King made an \nexpedition into Ireland, where some English nobles had revolted.  \nIt was one of the very few places from which he did not run away; \nbecause no resistance was shown.  He made another expedition into \nWales - whence he DID run away in the end:  but not before he had \ngot from the Welsh people, as hostages, twenty-seven young men of \nthe best families; every one of whom he caused to be slain in the \nfollowing year.\n\nTo Interdict and Excommunication, the Pope now added his last \nsentence; Deposition.  He proclaimed John no longer King, absolved \nall his subjects from their allegiance, and sent Stephen Langton \nand others to the King of France to tell him that, if he would \ninvade England, he should be forgiven all his sins - at least, \nshould be forgiven them by the Pope, if that would do.\n\nAs there was nothing that King Philip desired more than to invade \nEngland, he collected a great army at Rouen, and a fleet of \nseventeen hundred ships to bring them over.  But the English \npeople, however bitterly they hated the King, were not a people to \nsuffer invasion quietly.  They flocked to Dover, where the English \nstandard was, in such great numbers to enrol themselves as \ndefenders of their native land, that there were not provisions for \nthem, and the King could only select and retain sixty thousand.  \nBut, at this crisis, the Pope, who had his own reasons for \nobjecting to either King John or King Philip being too powerful, \ninterfered.  He entrusted a legate, whose name was PANDOLF, with \nthe easy task of frightening King John.  He sent him to the English \nCamp, from France, to terrify him with exaggerations of King \nPhilip\'s power, and his own weakness in the discontent of the \nEnglish Barons and people.  Pandolf discharged his commission so \nwell, that King John, in a wretched panic, consented to acknowledge \nStephen Langton; to resign his kingdom \'to God, Saint Peter, and \nSaint Paul\' - which meant the Pope; and to hold it, ever \nafterwards, by the Pope\'s leave, on payment of an annual sum of \nmoney.  To this shameful contract he publicly bound himself in the \nchurch of the Knights Templars at Dover:  where he laid at the \nlegate\'s feet a part of the tribute, which the legate haughtily \ntrampled upon.  But they DO say, that this was merely a genteel \nflourish, and that he was afterwards seen to pick it up and pocket \nit.\n\nThere was an unfortunate prophet, the name of Peter, who had \ngreatly increased King John\'s terrors by predicting that he would \nbe unknighted (which the King supposed to signify that he would \ndie) before the Feast of the Ascension should be past.  That was \nthe day after this humiliation.  When the next morning came, and \nthe King, who had been trembling all night, found himself alive and \nsafe, he ordered the prophet - and his son too - to be dragged \nthrough the streets at the tails of horses, and then hanged, for \nhaving frightened him.\n\nAs King John had now submitted, the Pope, to King Philip\'s great \nastonishment, took him under his protection, and informed King \nPhilip that he found he could not give him leave to invade England.  \nThe angry Philip resolved to do it without his leave but he gained \nnothing and lost much; for, the English, commanded by the Earl of \nSalisbury, went over, in five hundred ships, to the French coast, \nbefore the French fleet had sailed away from it, and utterly \ndefeated the whole.\n\nThe Pope then took off his three sentences, one after another, and \nempowered Stephen Langton publicly to receive King John into the \nfavour of the Church again, and to ask him to dinner.  The King, \nwho hated Langton with all his might and main - and with reason \ntoo, for he was a great and a good man, with whom such a King could \nhave no sympathy - pretended to cry and to be VERY grateful.  There \nwas a little difficulty about settling how much the King should pay \nas a recompense to the clergy for the losses he had caused them; \nbut, the end of it was, that the superior clergy got a good deal, \nand the inferior clergy got little or nothing - which has also \nhappened since King John\'s time, I believe.\n\nWhen all these matters were arranged, the King in his triumph \nbecame more fierce, and false, and insolent to all around him than \nhe had ever been.  An alliance of sovereigns against King Philip, \ngave him an opportunity of landing an army in France; with which he \neven took a town!  But, on the French King\'s gaining a great \nvictory, he ran away, of course, and made a truce for five years.\n\nAnd now the time approached when he was to be still further \nhumbled, and made to feel, if he could feel anything, what a \nwretched creature he was.  Of all men in the world, Stephen Langton \nseemed raised up by Heaven to oppose and subdue him.  When he \nruthlessly burnt and destroyed the property of his own subjects, \nbecause their Lords, the Barons, would not serve him abroad, \nStephen Langton fearlessly reproved and threatened him.  When he \nswore to restore the laws of King Edward, or the laws of King Henry \nthe First, Stephen Langton knew his falsehood, and pursued him \nthrough all his evasions.  When the Barons met at the abbey of \nSaint Edmund\'s-Bury, to consider their wrongs and the King\'s \noppressions, Stephen Langton roused them by his fervid words to \ndemand a solemn charter of rights and liberties from their perjured \nmaster, and to swear, one by one, on the High Altar, that they \nwould have it, or would wage war against him to the death.  When \nthe King hid himself in London from the Barons, and was at last \nobliged to receive them, they told him roundly they would not \nbelieve him unless Stephen Langton became a surety that he would \nkeep his word.  When he took the Cross to invest himself with some \ninterest, and belong to something that was received with favour, \nStephen Langton was still immovable.  When he appealed to the Pope, \nand the Pope wrote to Stephen Langton in behalf of his new \nfavourite, Stephen Langton was deaf, even to the Pope himself, and \nsaw before him nothing but the welfare of England and the crimes of \nthe English King.\n\nAt Easter-time, the Barons assembled at Stamford, in Lincolnshire, \nin proud array, and, marching near to Oxford where the King was, \ndelivered into the hands of Stephen Langton and two others, a list \nof grievances.  \'And these,\' they said, \'he must redress, or we \nwill do it for ourselves!\'  When Stephen Langton told the King as \nmuch, and read the list to him, he went half mad with rage.  But \nthat did him no more good than his afterwards trying to pacify the \nBarons with lies.  They called themselves and their followers, \'The \narmy of God and the Holy Church.\'  Marching through the country, \nwith the people thronging to them everywhere (except at \nNorthampton, where they failed in an attack upon the castle), they \nat last triumphantly set up their banner in London itself, whither \nthe whole land, tired of the tyrant, seemed to flock to join them.  \nSeven knights alone, of all the knights in England, remained with \nthe King; who, reduced to this strait, at last sent the Earl of \nPembroke to the Barons to say that he approved of everything, and \nwould meet them to sign their charter when they would.  \'Then,\' \nsaid the Barons, \'let the day be the fifteenth of June, and the \nplace, Runny-Mead.\'\n\nOn Monday, the fifteenth of June, one thousand two hundred and \nfourteen, the King came from Windsor Castle, and the Barons came \nfrom the town of Staines, and they met on Runny-Mead, which is \nstill a pleasant meadow by the Thames, where rushes grow in the \nclear water of the winding river, and its banks are green with \ngrass and trees.  On the side of the Barons, came the General of \ntheir army, ROBERT FITZ-WALTER, and a great concourse of the \nnobility of England.  With the King, came, in all, some four-and-\ntwenty persons of any note, most of whom despised him, and were \nmerely his advisers in form.  On that great day, and in that great \ncompany, the King signed MAGNA CHARTA - the great charter of \nEngland - by which he pledged himself to maintain the Church in its \nrights; to relieve the Barons of oppressive obligations as vassals \nof the Crown - of which the Barons, in their turn, pledged \nthemselves to relieve THEIR vassals, the people; to respect the \nliberties of London and all other cities and boroughs; to protect \nforeign merchants who came to England; to imprison no man without a \nfair trial; and to sell, delay, or deny justice to none.  As the \nBarons knew his falsehood well, they further required, as their \nsecurities, that he should send out of his kingdom all his foreign \ntroops; that for two months they should hold possession of the city \nof London, and Stephen Langton of the Tower; and that five-and-\ntwenty of their body, chosen by themselves, should be a lawful \ncommittee to watch the keeping of the charter, and to make war upon \nhim if he broke it.\n\nAll this he was obliged to yield.  He signed the charter with a \nsmile, and, if he could have looked agreeable, would have done so, \nas he departed from the splendid assembly.  When he got home to \nWindsor Castle, he was quite a madman in his helpless fury.  And he \nbroke the charter immediately afterwards.\n\nHe sent abroad for foreign soldiers, and sent to the Pope for help, \nand plotted to take London by surprise, while the Barons should be \nholding a great tournament at Stamford, which they had agreed to \nhold there as a celebration of the charter.  The Barons, however, \nfound him out and put it off.  Then, when the Barons desired to see \nhim and tax him with his treachery, he made numbers of appointments \nwith them, and kept none, and shifted from place to place, and was \nconstantly sneaking and skulking about.  At last he appeared at \nDover, to join his foreign soldiers, of whom numbers came into his \npay; and with them he besieged and took Rochester Castle, which was \noccupied by knights and soldiers of the Barons.  He would have \nhanged them every one; but the leader of the foreign soldiers, \nfearful of what the English people might afterwards do to him, \ninterfered to save the knights; therefore the King was fain to \nsatisfy his vengeance with the death of all the common men.  Then, \nhe sent the Earl of Salisbury, with one portion of his army, to \nravage the eastern part of his own dominions, while he carried fire \nand slaughter into the northern part; torturing, plundering, \nkilling, and inflicting every possible cruelty upon the people; \nand, every morning, setting a worthy example to his men by setting \nfire, with his own monster-hands, to the house where he had slept \nlast night.  Nor was this all; for the Pope, coming to the aid of \nhis precious friend, laid the kingdom under an Interdict again, \nbecause the people took part with the Barons.  It did not much \nmatter, for the people had grown so used to it now, that they had \nbegun to think nothing about it.  It occurred to them - perhaps to \nStephen Langton too - that they could keep their churches open, and \nring their bells, without the Pope\'s permission as well as with it.  \nSo, they tried the experiment - and found that it succeeded \nperfectly.\n\nIt being now impossible to bear the country, as a wilderness of \ncruelty, or longer to hold any terms with such a forsworn outlaw of \na King, the Barons sent to Louis, son of the French monarch, to \noffer him the English crown.  Caring as little for the Pope\'s \nexcommunication of him if he accepted the offer, as it is possible \nhis father may have cared for the Pope\'s forgiveness of his sins, \nhe landed at Sandwich (King John immediately running away from \nDover, where he happened to be), and went on to London.  The \nScottish King, with whom many of the Northern English Lords had \ntaken refuge; numbers of the foreign soldiers, numbers of the \nBarons, and numbers of the people went over to him every day; - \nKing John, the while, continually running away in all directions.\n\nThe career of Louis was checked however, by the suspicions of the \nBarons, founded on the dying declaration of a French Lord, that \nwhen the kingdom was conquered he was sworn to banish them as \ntraitors, and to give their estates to some of his own Nobles.  \nRather than suffer this, some of the Barons hesitated:  others even \nwent over to King John.\n\nIt seemed to be the turning-point of King John\'s fortunes, for, in \nhis savage and murderous course, he had now taken some towns and \nmet with some successes.  But, happily for England and humanity, \nhis death was near.  Crossing a dangerous quicksand, called the \nWash, not very far from Wisbeach, the tide came up and nearly \ndrowned his army.  He and his soldiers escaped; but, looking back \nfrom the shore when he was safe, he saw the roaring water sweep \ndown in a torrent, overturn the waggons, horses, and men, that \ncarried his treasure, and engulf them in a raging whirlpool from \nwhich nothing could be delivered.\n\nCursing, and swearing, and gnawing his fingers, he went on to \nSwinestead Abbey, where the monks set before him quantities of \npears, and peaches, and new cider - some say poison too, but there \nis very little reason to suppose so - of which he ate and drank in \nan immoderate and beastly way.  All night he lay ill of a burning \nfever, and haunted with horrible fears.  Next day, they put him in \na horse-litter, and carried him to Sleaford Castle, where he passed \nanother night of pain and horror.  Next day, they carried him, with \ngreater difficulty than on the day before, to the castle of Newark \nupon Trent; and there, on the eighteenth of October, in the forty-\nninth year of his age, and the seventeenth of his vile reign, was \nan end of this miserable brute.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV - ENGLAND UNDER HENRY THE THIRD, CALLED, OF WINCHESTER\n\n\n\nIF any of the English Barons remembered the murdered Arthur\'s \nsister, Eleanor the fair maid of Brittany, shut up in her convent \nat Bristol, none among them spoke of her now, or maintained her \nright to the Crown.  The dead Usurper\'s eldest boy, HENRY by name, \nwas taken by the Earl of Pembroke, the Marshal of England, to the \ncity of Gloucester, and there crowned in great haste when he was \nonly ten years old.  As the Crown itself had been lost with the \nKing\'s treasure in the raging water, and as there was no time to \nmake another, they put a circle of plain gold upon his head \ninstead.  \'We have been the enemies of this child\'s father,\' said \nLord Pembroke, a good and true gentleman, to the few Lords who were \npresent, \'and he merited our ill-will; but the child himself is \ninnocent, and his youth demands our friendship and protection.\'  \nThose Lords felt tenderly towards the little boy, remembering their \nown young children; and they bowed their heads, and said, \'Long \nlive King Henry the Third!\'\n\nNext, a great council met at Bristol, revised Magna Charta, and \nmade Lord Pembroke Regent or Protector of England, as the King was \ntoo young to reign alone.  The next thing to be done, was to get \nrid of Prince Louis of France, and to win over those English Barons \nwho were still ranged under his banner.  He was strong in many \nparts of England, and in London itself; and he held, among other \nplaces, a certain Castle called the Castle of Mount Sorel, in \nLeicestershire.  To this fortress, after some skirmishing and \ntruce-making, Lord Pembroke laid siege.  Louis despatched an army \nof six hundred knights and twenty thousand soldiers to relieve it.  \nLord Pembroke, who was not strong enough for such a force, retired \nwith all his men.  The army of the French Prince, which had marched \nthere with fire and plunder, marched away with fire and plunder, \nand came, in a boastful swaggering manner, to Lincoln.  The town \nsubmitted; but the Castle in the town, held by a brave widow lady, \nnamed NICHOLA DE CAMVILLE (whose property it was), made such a \nsturdy resistance, that the French Count in command of the army of \nthe French Prince found it necessary to besiege this Castle.  While \nhe was thus engaged, word was brought to him that Lord Pembroke, \nwith four hundred knights, two hundred and fifty men with cross-\nbows, and a stout force both of horse and foot, was marching \ntowards him.  \'What care I?\' said the French Count.  \'The \nEnglishman is not so mad as to attack me and my great army in a \nwalled town!\'  But the Englishman did it for all that, and did it - \nnot so madly but so wisely, that he decoyed the great army into the \nnarrow, ill-paved lanes and byways of Lincoln, where its horse-\nsoldiers could not ride in any strong body; and there he made such \nhavoc with them, that the whole force surrendered themselves \nprisoners, except the Count; who said that he would never yield to \nany English traitor alive, and accordingly got killed.  The end of \nthis victory, which the English called, for a joke, the Fair of \nLincoln, was the usual one in those times - the common men were \nslain without any mercy, and the knights and gentlemen paid ransom \nand went home.\n\nThe wife of Louis, the fair BLANCHE OF CASTILE, dutifully equipped \na fleet of eighty good ships, and sent it over from France to her \nhusband\'s aid.  An English fleet of forty ships, some good and some \nbad, gallantly met them near the mouth of the Thames, and took or \nsunk sixty-five in one fight.  This great loss put an end to the \nFrench Prince\'s hopes.  A treaty was made at Lambeth, in virtue of \nwhich the English Barons who had remained attached to his cause \nreturned to their allegiance, and it was engaged on both sides that \nthe Prince and all his troops should retire peacefully to France.  \nIt was time to go; for war had made him so poor that he was obliged \nto borrow money from the citizens of London to pay his expenses \nhome.\n\nLord Pembroke afterwards applied himself to governing the country \njustly, and to healing the quarrels and disturbances that had \narisen among men in the days of the bad King John.  He caused Magna \nCharta to be still more improved, and so amended the Forest Laws \nthat a Peasant was no longer put to death for killing a stag in a \nRoyal Forest, but was only imprisoned.  It would have been well for \nEngland if it could have had so good a Protector many years longer, \nbut that was not to be.  Within three years after the young King\'s \nCoronation, Lord Pembroke died; and you may see his tomb, at this \nday, in the old Temple Church in London.\n\nThe Protectorship was now divided.  PETER DE ROCHES, whom King John \nhad made Bishop of Winchester, was entrusted with the care of the \nperson of the young sovereign; and the exercise of the Royal \nauthority was confided to EARL HUBERT DE BURGH.  These two \npersonages had from the first no liking for each other, and soon \nbecame enemies.  When the young King was declared of age, Peter de \nRoches, finding that Hubert increased in power and favour, retired \ndiscontentedly, and went abroad.  For nearly ten years afterwards \nHubert had full sway alone.\n\nBut ten years is a long time to hold the favour of a King.  This \nKing, too, as he grew up, showed a strong resemblance to his \nfather, in feebleness, inconsistency, and irresolution.  The best \nthat can be said of him is that he was not cruel.  De Roches coming \nhome again, after ten years, and being a novelty, the King began to \nfavour him and to look coldly on Hubert.  Wanting money besides, \nand having made Hubert rich, he began to dislike Hubert.  At last \nhe was made to believe, or pretended to believe, that Hubert had \nmisappropriated some of the Royal treasure; and ordered him to \nfurnish an account of all he had done in his administration.  \nBesides which, the foolish charge was brought against Hubert that \nhe had made himself the King\'s favourite by magic.  Hubert very \nwell knowing that he could never defend himself against such \nnonsense, and that his old enemy must be determined on his ruin, \ninstead of answering the charges fled to Merton Abbey.  Then the \nKing, in a violent passion, sent for the Mayor of London, and said \nto the Mayor, \'Take twenty thousand citizens, and drag me Hubert de \nBurgh out of that abbey, and bring him here.\'  The Mayor posted off \nto do it, but the Archbishop of Dublin (who was a friend of \nHubert\'s) warning the King that an abbey was a sacred place, and \nthat if he committed any violence there, he must answer for it to \nthe Church, the King changed his mind and called the Mayor back, \nand declared that Hubert should have four months to prepare his \ndefence, and should be safe and free during that time.\n\nHubert, who relied upon the King\'s word, though I think he was old \nenough to have known better, came out of Merton Abbey upon these \nconditions, and journeyed away to see his wife:  a Scottish \nPrincess who was then at St. Edmund\'s-Bury.\n\nAlmost as soon as he had departed from the Sanctuary, his enemies \npersuaded the weak King to send out one SIR GODFREY DE CRANCUMB, \nwho commanded three hundred vagabonds called the Black Band, with \norders to seize him.  They came up with him at a little town in \nEssex, called Brentwood, when he was in bed.  He leaped out of bed, \ngot out of the house, fled to the church, ran up to the altar, and \nlaid his hand upon the cross.  Sir Godfrey and the Black Band, \ncaring neither for church, altar, nor cross, dragged him forth to \nthe church door, with their drawn swords flashing round his head, \nand sent for a Smith to rivet a set of chains upon him.  When the \nSmith (I wish I knew his name!) was brought, all dark and swarthy \nwith the smoke of his forge, and panting with the speed he had \nmade; and the Black Band, falling aside to show him the Prisoner, \ncried with a loud uproar, \'Make the fetters heavy! make them \nstrong!\' the Smith dropped upon his knee - but not to the Black \nBand - and said, \'This is the brave Earl Hubert de Burgh, who \nfought at Dover Castle, and destroyed the French fleet, and has \ndone his country much good service.  You may kill me, if you like, \nbut I will never make a chain for Earl Hubert de Burgh!\'\n\nThe Black Band never blushed, or they might have blushed at this.  \nThey knocked the Smith about from one to another, and swore at him, \nand tied the Earl on horseback, undressed as he was, and carried \nhim off to the Tower of London.  The Bishops, however, were so \nindignant at the violation of the Sanctuary of the Church, that the \nfrightened King soon ordered the Black Band to take him back again; \nat the same time commanding the Sheriff of Essex to prevent his \nescaping out of Brentwood Church.  Well! the Sheriff dug a deep \ntrench all round the church, and erected a high fence, and watched \nthe church night and day; the Black Band and their Captain watched \nit too, like three hundred and one black wolves.  For thirty-nine \ndays, Hubert de Burgh remained within.  At length, upon the \nfortieth day, cold and hunger were too much for him, and he gave \nhimself up to the Black Band, who carried him off, for the second \ntime, to the Tower.  When his trial came on, he refused to plead; \nbut at last it was arranged that he should give up all the royal \nlands which had been bestowed upon him, and should be kept at the \nCastle of Devizes, in what was called \'free prison,\' in charge of \nfour knights appointed by four lords.  There, he remained almost a \nyear, until, learning that a follower of his old enemy the Bishop \nwas made Keeper of the Castle, and fearing that he might be killed \nby treachery, he climbed the ramparts one dark night, dropped from \nthe top of the high Castle wall into the moat, and coming safely to \nthe ground, took refuge in another church.  From this place he was \ndelivered by a party of horse despatched to his help by some \nnobles, who were by this time in revolt against the King, and \nassembled in Wales.  He was finally pardoned and restored to his \nestates, but he lived privately, and never more aspired to a high \npost in the realm, or to a high place in the King\'s favour.  And \nthus end - more happily than the stories of many favourites of \nKings - the adventures of Earl Hubert de Burgh.\n\nThe nobles, who had risen in revolt, were stirred up to rebellion \nby the overbearing conduct of the Bishop of Winchester, who, \nfinding that the King secretly hated the Great Charter which had \nbeen forced from his father, did his utmost to confirm him in that \ndislike, and in the preference he showed to foreigners over the \nEnglish.  Of this, and of his even publicly declaring that the \nBarons of England were inferior to those of France, the English \nLords complained with such bitterness, that the King, finding them \nwell supported by the clergy, became frightened for his throne, and \nsent away the Bishop and all his foreign associates.  On his \nmarriage, however, with ELEANOR, a French lady, the daughter of the \nCount of Provence, he openly favoured the foreigners again; and so \nmany of his wife\'s relations came over, and made such an immense \nfamily-party at court, and got so many good things, and pocketed so \nmuch money, and were so high with the English whose money they \npocketed, that the bolder English Barons murmured openly about a \nclause there was in the Great Charter, which provided for the \nbanishment of unreasonable favourites.  But, the foreigners only \nlaughed disdainfully, and said, \'What are your English laws to us?\'\n\nKing Philip of France had died, and had been succeeded by Prince \nLouis, who had also died after a short reign of three years, and \nhad been succeeded by his son of the same name - so moderate and \njust a man that he was not the least in the world like a King, as \nKings went.  ISABELLA, King Henry\'s mother, wished very much (for a \ncertain spite she had) that England should make war against this \nKing; and, as King Henry was a mere puppet in anybody\'s hands who \nknew how to manage his feebleness, she easily carried her point \nwith him.  But, the Parliament were determined to give him no money \nfor such a war.  So, to defy the Parliament, he packed up thirty \nlarge casks of silver - I don\'t know how he got so much; I dare say \nhe screwed it out of the miserable Jews - and put them aboard ship, \nand went away himself to carry war into France:  accompanied by his \nmother and his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall, who was rich and \nclever.  But he only got well beaten, and came home.\n\nThe good-humour of the Parliament was not restored by this.  They \nreproached the King with wasting the public money to make greedy \nforeigners rich, and were so stern with him, and so determined not \nto let him have more of it to waste if they could help it, that he \nwas at his wit\'s end for some, and tried so shamelessly to get all \nhe could from his subjects, by excuses or by force, that the people \nused to say the King was the sturdiest beggar in England.  He took \nthe Cross, thinking to get some money by that means; but, as it was \nvery well known that he never meant to go on a crusade, he got \nnone.  In all this contention, the Londoners were particularly keen \nagainst the King, and the King hated them warmly in return.  Hating \nor loving, however, made no difference; he continued in the same \ncondition for nine or ten years, when at last the Barons said that \nif he would solemnly confirm their liberties afresh, the Parliament \nwould vote him a large sum.\n\nAs he readily consented, there was a great meeting held in \nWestminster Hall, one pleasant day in May, when all the clergy, \ndressed in their robes and holding every one of them a burning \ncandle in his hand, stood up (the Barons being also there) while \nthe Archbishop of Canterbury read the sentence of excommunication \nagainst any man, and all men, who should henceforth, in any way, \ninfringe the Great Charter of the Kingdom.  When he had done, they \nall put out their burning candles with a curse upon the soul of any \none, and every one, who should merit that sentence.  The King \nconcluded with an oath to keep the Charter, \'As I am a man, as I am \na Christian, as I am a Knight, as I am a King!\'\n\nIt was easy to make oaths, and easy to break them; and the King did \nboth, as his father had done before him.  He took to his old \ncourses again when he was supplied with money, and soon cured of \ntheir weakness the few who had ever really trusted him.  When his \nmoney was gone, and he was once more borrowing and begging \neverywhere with a meanness worthy of his nature, he got into a \ndifficulty with the Pope respecting the Crown of Sicily, which the \nPope said he had a right to give away, and which he offered to King \nHenry for his second son, PRINCE EDMUND.  But, if you or I give \naway what we have not got, and what belongs to somebody else, it is \nlikely that the person to whom we give it, will have some trouble \nin taking it.  It was exactly so in this case.  It was necessary to \nconquer the Sicilian Crown before it could be put upon young \nEdmund\'s head.  It could not be conquered without money.  The Pope \nordered the clergy to raise money.  The clergy, however, were not \nso obedient to him as usual; they had been disputing with him for \nsome time about his unjust preference of Italian Priests in \nEngland; and they had begun to doubt whether the King\'s chaplain, \nwhom he allowed to be paid for preaching in seven hundred churches, \ncould possibly be, even by the Pope\'s favour, in seven hundred \nplaces at once.  \'The Pope and the King together,\' said the Bishop \nof London, \'may take the mitre off my head; but, if they do, they \nwill find that I shall put on a soldier\'s helmet.  I pay nothing.\'  \nThe Bishop of Worcester was as bold as the Bishop of London, and \nwould pay nothing either.  Such sums as the more timid or more \nhelpless of the clergy did raise were squandered away, without \ndoing any good to the King, or bringing the Sicilian Crown an inch \nnearer to Prince Edmund\'s head.  The end of the business was, that \nthe Pope gave the Crown to the brother of the King of France (who \nconquered it for himself), and sent the King of England in, a bill \nof one hundred thousand pounds for the expenses of not having won \nit.\n\nThe King was now so much distressed that we might almost pity him, \nif it were possible to pity a King so shabby and ridiculous.  His \nclever brother, Richard, had bought the title of King of the Romans \nfrom the German people, and was no longer near him, to help him \nwith advice.  The clergy, resisting the very Pope, were in alliance \nwith the Barons.  The Barons were headed by SIMON DE MONTFORT, Earl \nof Leicester, married to King Henry\'s sister, and, though a \nforeigner himself, the most popular man in England against the \nforeign favourites.  When the King next met his Parliament, the \nBarons, led by this Earl, came before him, armed from head to foot, \nand cased in armour.  When the Parliament again assembled, in a \nmonth\'s time, at Oxford, this Earl was at their head, and the King \nwas obliged to consent, on oath, to what was called a Committee of \nGovernment:  consisting of twenty-four members:  twelve chosen by \nthe Barons, and twelve chosen by himself.\n\nBut, at a good time for him, his brother Richard came back.  \nRichard\'s first act (the Barons would not admit him into England on \nother terms) was to swear to be faithful to the Committee of \nGovernment - which he immediately began to oppose with all his \nmight.  Then, the Barons began to quarrel among themselves; \nespecially the proud Earl of Gloucester with the Earl of Leicester, \nwho went abroad in disgust.  Then, the people began to be \ndissatisfied with the Barons, because they did not do enough for \nthem.  The King\'s chances seemed so good again at length, that he \ntook heart enough - or caught it from his brother - to tell the \nCommittee of Government that he abolished them - as to his oath, \nnever mind that, the Pope said! - and to seize all the money in the \nMint, and to shut himself up in the Tower of London.  Here he was \njoined by his eldest son, Prince Edward; and, from the Tower, he \nmade public a letter of the Pope\'s to the world in general, \ninforming all men that he had been an excellent and just King for \nfive-and-forty years.\n\nAs everybody knew he had been nothing of the sort, nobody cared \nmuch for this document.  It so chanced that the proud Earl of \nGloucester dying, was succeeded by his son; and that his son, \ninstead of being the enemy of the Earl of Leicester, was (for the \ntime) his friend.  It fell out, therefore, that these two Earls \njoined their forces, took several of the Royal Castles in the \ncountry, and advanced as hard as they could on London.  The London \npeople, always opposed to the King, declared for them with great \njoy.  The King himself remained shut up, not at all gloriously, in \nthe Tower.  Prince Edward made the best of his way to Windsor \nCastle.  His mother, the Queen, attempted to follow him by water; \nbut, the people seeing her barge rowing up the river, and hating \nher with all their hearts, ran to London Bridge, got together a \nquantity of stones and mud, and pelted the barge as it came \nthrough, crying furiously, \'Drown the Witch!  Drown her!\'  They \nwere so near doing it, that the Mayor took the old lady under his \nprotection, and shut her up in St. Paul\'s until the danger was \npast.\n\nIt would require a great deal of writing on my part, and a great \ndeal of reading on yours, to follow the King through his disputes \nwith the Barons, and to follow the Barons through their disputes \nwith one another - so I will make short work of it for both of us, \nand only relate the chief events that arose out of these quarrels.  \nThe good King of France was asked to decide between them.  He gave \nit as his opinion that the King must maintain the Great Charter, \nand that the Barons must give up the Committee of Government, and \nall the rest that had been done by the Parliament at Oxford:  which \nthe Royalists, or King\'s party, scornfully called the Mad \nParliament.  The Barons declared that these were not fair terms, \nand they would not accept them.  Then they caused the great bell of \nSt. Paul\'s to be tolled, for the purpose of rousing up the London \npeople, who armed themselves at the dismal sound and formed quite \nan army in the streets.  I am sorry to say, however, that instead \nof falling upon the King\'s party with whom their quarrel was, they \nfell upon the miserable Jews, and killed at least five hundred of \nthem.  They pretended that some of these Jews were on the King\'s \nside, and that they kept hidden in their houses, for the \ndestruction of the people, a certain terrible composition called \nGreek Fire, which could not be put out with water, but only burnt \nthe fiercer for it.  What they really did keep in their houses was \nmoney; and this their cruel enemies wanted, and this their cruel \nenemies took, like robbers and murderers.\n\nThe Earl of Leicester put himself at the head of these Londoners \nand other forces, and followed the King to Lewes in Sussex, where \nhe lay encamped with his army.  Before giving the King\'s forces \nbattle here, the Earl addressed his soldiers, and said that King \nHenry the Third had broken so many oaths, that he had become the \nenemy of God, and therefore they would wear white crosses on their \nbreasts, as if they were arrayed, not against a fellow-Christian, \nbut against a Turk.  White-crossed accordingly, they rushed into \nthe fight.  They would have lost the day - the King having on his \nside all the foreigners in England:  and, from Scotland, JOHN \nCOMYN, JOHN BALIOL, and ROBERT BRUCE, with all their men - but for \nthe impatience of PRINCE EDWARD, who, in his hot desire to have \nvengeance on the people of London, threw the whole of his father\'s \narmy into confusion.  He was taken Prisoner; so was the King; so \nwas the King\'s brother the King of the Romans; and five thousand \nEnglishmen were left dead upon the bloody grass.\n\nFor this success, the Pope excommunicated the Earl of Leicester:  \nwhich neither the Earl nor the people cared at all about.  The \npeople loved him and supported him, and he became the real King; \nhaving all the power of the government in his own hands, though he \nwas outwardly respectful to King Henry the Third, whom he took with \nhim wherever he went, like a poor old limp court-card.  He summoned \na Parliament (in the year one thousand two hundred and sixty-five) \nwhich was the first Parliament in England that the people had any \nreal share in electing; and he grew more and more in favour with \nthe people every day, and they stood by him in whatever he did.\n\nMany of the other Barons, and particularly the Earl of Gloucester, \nwho had become by this time as proud as his father, grew jealous of \nthis powerful and popular Earl, who was proud too, and began to \nconspire against him.  Since the battle of Lewes, Prince Edward had \nbeen kept as a hostage, and, though he was otherwise treated like a \nPrince, had never been allowed to go out without attendants \nappointed by the Earl of Leicester, who watched him.  The \nconspiring Lords found means to propose to him, in secret, that \nthey should assist him to escape, and should make him their leader; \nto which he very heartily consented.\n\nSo, on a day that was agreed upon, he said to his attendants after \ndinner (being then at Hereford), \'I should like to ride on \nhorseback, this fine afternoon, a little way into the country.\'  As \nthey, too, thought it would be very pleasant to have a canter in \nthe sunshine, they all rode out of the town together in a gay \nlittle troop.  When they came to a fine level piece of turf, the \nPrince fell to comparing their horses one with another, and \noffering bets that one was faster than another; and the attendants, \nsuspecting no harm, rode galloping matches until their horses were \nquite tired.  The Prince rode no matches himself, but looked on \nfrom his saddle, and staked his money.  Thus they passed the whole \nmerry afternoon.  Now, the sun was setting, and they were all going \nslowly up a hill, the Prince\'s horse very fresh and all the other \nhorses very weary, when a strange rider mounted on a grey steed \nappeared at the top of the hill, and waved his hat.  \'What does the \nfellow mean?\' said the attendants one to another.  The Prince \nanswered on the instant by setting spurs to his horse, dashing away \nat his utmost speed, joining the man, riding into the midst of a \nlittle crowd of horsemen who were then seen waiting under some \ntrees, and who closed around him; and so he departed in a cloud of \ndust, leaving the road empty of all but the baffled attendants, who \nsat looking at one another, while their horses drooped their ears \nand panted.\n\nThe Prince joined the Earl of Gloucester at Ludlow.  The Earl of \nLeicester, with a part of the army and the stupid old King, was at \nHereford.  One of the Earl of Leicester\'s sons, Simon de Montfort, \nwith another part of the army, was in Sussex.  To prevent these two \nparts from uniting was the Prince\'s first object.  He attacked \nSimon de Montfort by night, defeated him, seized his banners and \ntreasure, and forced him into Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire, \nwhich belonged to his family.\n\nHis father, the Earl of Leicester, in the meanwhile, not knowing \nwhat had happened, marched out of Hereford, with his part of the \narmy and the King, to meet him.  He came, on a bright morning in \nAugust, to Evesham, which is watered by the pleasant river Avon.  \nLooking rather anxiously across the prospect towards Kenilworth, he \nsaw his own banners advancing; and his face brightened with joy.  \nBut, it clouded darkly when he presently perceived that the banners \nwere captured, and in the enemy\'s hands; and he said, \'It is over.  \nThe Lord have mercy on our souls, for our bodies are Prince \nEdward\'s!\'\n\nHe fought like a true Knight, nevertheless.  When his horse was \nkilled under him, he fought on foot.  It was a fierce battle, and \nthe dead lay in heaps everywhere.  The old King, stuck up in a suit \nof armour on a big war-horse, which didn\'t mind him at all, and \nwhich carried him into all sorts of places where he didn\'t want to \ngo, got into everybody\'s way, and very nearly got knocked on the \nhead by one of his son\'s men.  But he managed to pipe out, \'I am \nHarry of Winchester!\' and the Prince, who heard him, seized his \nbridle, and took him out of peril.  The Earl of Leicester still \nfought bravely, until his best son Henry was killed, and the bodies \nof his best friends choked his path; and then he fell, still \nfighting, sword in hand.  They mangled his body, and sent it as a \npresent to a noble lady - but a very unpleasant lady, I should \nthink - who was the wife of his worst enemy.  They could not mangle \nhis memory in the minds of the faithful people, though.  Many years \nafterwards, they loved him more than ever, and regarded him as a \nSaint, and always spoke of him as \'Sir Simon the Righteous.\'\n\nAnd even though he was dead, the cause for which he had fought \nstill lived, and was strong, and forced itself upon the King in the \nvery hour of victory.  Henry found himself obliged to respect the \nGreat Charter, however much he hated it, and to make laws similar \nto the laws of the Great Earl of Leicester, and to be moderate and \nforgiving towards the people at last - even towards the people of \nLondon, who had so long opposed him.  There were more risings \nbefore all this was done, but they were set at rest by these means, \nand Prince Edward did his best in all things to restore peace.  One \nSir Adam de Gourdon was the last dissatisfied knight in arms; but, \nthe Prince vanquished him in single combat, in a wood, and nobly \ngave him his life, and became his friend, instead of slaying him.  \nSir Adam was not ungrateful.  He ever afterwards remained devoted \nto his generous conqueror.\n\nWhen the troubles of the Kingdom were thus calmed, Prince Edward \nand his cousin Henry took the Cross, and went away to the Holy \nLand, with many English Lords and Knights.  Four years afterwards \nthe King of the Romans died, and, next year (one thousand two \nhundred and seventy-two), his brother the weak King of England \ndied.  He was sixty-eight years old then, and had reigned fifty-six \nyears.  He was as much of a King in death, as he had ever been in \nlife.  He was the mere pale shadow of a King at all times.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI - ENGLAND UNDER EDWARD THE FIRST, CALLED LONGSHANKS\n\n\n\nIT was now the year of our Lord one thousand two hundred and \nseventy-two; and Prince Edward, the heir to the throne, being away \nin the Holy Land, knew nothing of his father\'s death.  The Barons, \nhowever, proclaimed him King, immediately after the Royal funeral; \nand the people very willingly consented, since most men knew too \nwell by this time what the horrors of a contest for the crown were.  \nSo King Edward the First, called, in a not very complimentary \nmanner, LONGSHANKS, because of the slenderness of his legs, was \npeacefully accepted by the English Nation.\n\nHis legs had need to be strong, however long and thin they were; \nfor they had to support him through many difficulties on the fiery \nsands of Asia, where his small force of soldiers fainted, died, \ndeserted, and seemed to melt away.  But his prowess made light of \nit, and he said, \'I will go on, if I go on with no other follower \nthan my groom!\'\n\nA Prince of this spirit gave the Turks a deal of trouble.  He \nstormed Nazareth, at which place, of all places on earth, I am \nsorry to relate, he made a frightful slaughter of innocent people; \nand then he went to Acre, where he got a truce of ten years from \nthe Sultan.  He had very nearly lost his life in Acre, through the \ntreachery of a Saracen Noble, called the Emir of Jaffa, who, making \nthe pretence that he had some idea of turning Christian and wanted \nto know all about that religion, sent a trusty messenger to Edward \nvery often - with a dagger in his sleeve.  At last, one Friday in \nWhitsun week, when it was very hot, and all the sandy prospect lay \nbeneath the blazing sun, burnt up like a great overdone biscuit, \nand Edward was lying on a couch, dressed for coolness in only a \nloose robe, the messenger, with his chocolate-coloured face and his \nbright dark eyes and white teeth, came creeping in with a letter, \nand kneeled down like a tame tiger.  But, the moment Edward \nstretched out his hand to take the letter, the tiger made a spring \nat his heart.  He was quick, but Edward was quick too.  He seized \nthe traitor by his chocolate throat, threw him to the ground, and \nslew him with the very dagger he had drawn.  The weapon had struck \nEdward in the arm, and although the wound itself was slight, it \nthreatened to be mortal, for the blade of the dagger had been \nsmeared with poison.  Thanks, however, to a better surgeon than was \noften to be found in those times, and to some wholesome herbs, and \nabove all, to his faithful wife, ELEANOR, who devotedly nursed him, \nand is said by some to have sucked the poison from the wound with \nher own red lips (which I am very willing to believe), Edward soon \nrecovered and was sound again.\n\nAs the King his father had sent entreaties to him to return home, \nhe now began the journey.  He had got as far as Italy, when he met \nmessengers who brought him intelligence of the King\'s death.  \nHearing that all was quiet at home, he made no haste to return to \nhis own dominions, but paid a visit to the Pope, and went in state \nthrough various Italian Towns, where he was welcomed with \nacclamations as a mighty champion of the Cross from the Holy Land, \nand where he received presents of purple mantles and prancing \nhorses, and went along in great triumph.  The shouting people \nlittle knew that he was the last English monarch who would ever \nembark in a crusade, or that within twenty years every conquest \nwhich the Christians had made in the Holy Land at the cost of so \nmuch blood, would be won back by the Turks.  But all this came to \npass.\n\nThere was, and there is, an old town standing in a plain in France, \ncalled ChÉlons.  When the King was coming towards this place on his \nway to England, a wily French Lord, called the Count of ChÉlons, \nsent him a polite challenge to come with his knights and hold a \nfair tournament with the Count and HIS knights, and make a day of \nit with sword and lance.  It was represented to the King that the \nCount of ChÉlons was not to be trusted, and that, instead of a \nholiday fight for mere show and in good humour, he secretly meant a \nreal battle, in which the English should be defeated by superior \nforce.\n\nThe King, however, nothing afraid, went to the appointed place on \nthe appointed day with a thousand followers.  When the Count came \nwith two thousand and attacked the English in earnest, the English \nrushed at them with such valour that the Count\'s men and the \nCount\'s horses soon began to be tumbled down all over the field.  \nThe Count himself seized the King round the neck, but the King \ntumbled HIM out of his saddle in return for the compliment, and, \njumping from his own horse, and standing over him, beat away at his \niron armour like a blacksmith hammering on his anvil.  Even when \nthe Count owned himself defeated and offered his sword, the King \nwould not do him the honour to take it, but made him yield it up to \na common soldier.  There had been such fury shown in this fight, \nthat it was afterwards called the little Battle of ChÉlons.\n\nThe English were very well disposed to be proud of their King after \nthese adventures; so, when he landed at Dover in the year one \nthousand two hundred and seventy-four (being then thirty-six years \nold), and went on to Westminster where he and his good Queen were \ncrowned with great magnificence, splendid rejoicings took place.  \nFor the coronation-feast there were provided, among other eatables, \nfour hundred oxen, four hundred sheep, four hundred and fifty pigs, \neighteen wild boars, three hundred flitches of bacon, and twenty \nthousand fowls.  The fountains and conduits in the street flowed \nwith red and white wine instead of water; the rich citizens hung \nsilks and cloths of the brightest colours out of their windows to \nincrease the beauty of the show, and threw out gold and silver by \nwhole handfuls to make scrambles for the crowd.  In short, there \nwas such eating and drinking, such music and capering, such a \nringing of bells and tossing of caps, such a shouting, and singing, \nand revelling, as the narrow overhanging streets of old London City \nhad not witnessed for many a long day.  All the people were merry \nexcept the poor Jews, who, trembling within their houses, and \nscarcely daring to peep out, began to foresee that they would have \nto find the money for this joviality sooner or later.\n";
