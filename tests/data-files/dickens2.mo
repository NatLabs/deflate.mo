A\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\n\n\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\n\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\nfiles per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach 80 billion Etexts.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\n\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/BU\":  and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

They are England and Scotland, and Ireland.  England and \nScotland form the greater part of these Islands.  Ireland is the \nnext in size.  The little neighbouring islands, which are so small \nupon the Map as to be mere dots, are chiefly little bits of \nScotland, - broken off, I dare say, in the course of a great length \nof time, by the power of the restless water.\n\nIn the old days, a long, long while ago, before Our Saviour was \nborn on earth and lay asleep in a manger, these Islands were in the \nsame place, and the stormy sea roared round them, just as it roars \nnow.  But the sea was not alive, then, with great ships and brave \nsailors, sailing to and from all parts of the world.  It was very \nlonely.  The Islands lay solitary, in the great expanse of water.  \nThe foaming waves dashed against their cliffs, and the bleak winds \nblew over their forests; but the winds and waves brought no \nadventurers to land upon the Islands, and the savage Islanders knew \nnothing of the rest of the world, and the rest of the world knew \nnothing of them.\n\nIt is supposed that the Phoenicians, who were an ancient people, \nfamous for carrying on trade, came in ships to these Islands, and \nfound that they produced tin and lead; both very useful things, as \nyou know, and both produced to this very hour upon the sea-coast. \nThe most celebrated tin mines in Cornwall are, still, close to the \nsea.  One of them, which I have seen, is so close to it that it is \nhollowed out underneath the ocean; and the miners say, that in \nstormy weather, when they are at work down in that deep place, they \ncan hear the noise of the waves thundering above their heads.  So, \nthe Phoenicians, coasting about the Islands, would come, without \nmuch difficulty, to where the tin and lead were.\n\nThe Phoenicians traded with the Islanders for these metals, and \ngave the Islanders some other useful things in exchange.  The \nIslanders were, at first, poor savages, going almost naked, or only \ndressed in the rough skins of beasts, and staining their bodies, as \nother savages do, with coloured earths and the juices of plants.  \nBut the Phoenicians, sailing over to the opposite coasts of France \nand Belgium, and saying to the people there, \'We have been to those \nwhite cliffs across the water, which you can see in fine weather, \nand from that country, which is called BRITAIN, we bring this tin \nand lead,\' tempted some of the French and Belgians to come over \nalso.  These people settled themselves on the south coast of \nEngland, which is now called Kent; and, although they were a rough \npeople too, they taught the savage Britons some useful arts, and \nimproved that part of the Islands.  It is probable that other \npeople came over from Spain to Ireland, and settled there.\n\nThus, by little and little, strangers became mixed with the \nIslanders, and the savage Britons grew into a wild, bold people; \nalmost savage, still, especially in the interior of the country \naway from the sea where the foreign settlers seldom went; but \nhardy, brave, and strong.\n\nThe whole country was covered with forests, and swamps.  The \ngreater part of it was very misty and cold.  There were no roads, \nno bridges, no streets, no houses that you would think deserving of \nthe name.  A town was nothing but a collection of straw-covered \nhuts, hidden in a thick wood, with a ditch all round, and a low \nwall, made of mud, or the trunks of trees placed one upon another.  \nThe people planted little or no corn, but lived upon the flesh of \ntheir flocks and cattle.  They made no coins, but used metal rings \nfor money.  They were clever in basket-work, as savage people often \nare; and they could make a coarse kind of cloth, and some very bad \nearthenware.  But in building fortresses they were much more \nclever.\n\nThey made boats of basket-work, covered with the skins of animals, \nbut seldom, if ever, ventured far from the shore.  They made \nswords, of copper mixed with tin; but, these swords were of an \nawkward shape, and so soft that a heavy blow would bend one.  They \nmade light shields, short pointed daggers, and spears - which they \njerked back after they had thrown them at an enemy, by a long strip \nof leather fastened to the stem.  The butt-end was a rattle, to \nfrighten an enemy\'s horse.  The ancient Britons, being divided into \nas many as thirty or forty tribes, each commanded by its own little \nking, were constantly fighting with one another, as savage people \nusually do; and they always fought with these weapons.\n\nThey were very fond of horses.  The standard of Kent was the \npicture of a white horse.  They could break them in and manage them \nwonderfully well.  Indeed, the horses (of which they had an \nabundance, though they were rather small) were so well taught in \nthose days, that they can scarcely be said to have improved since; \nthough the men are so much wiser.  They understood, and obeyed, \nevery word of command; and would stand still by themselves, in all \nthe din and noise of battle, while their masters went to fight on \nfoot.  The Britons could not have succeeded in their most \nremarkable art, without the aid of these sensible and trusty \nanimals.  The art I mean, is the construction and management of \nwar-chariots or cars, for which they have ever been celebrated in \nhistory.  Each of the best sort of these chariots, not quite breast \nhigh in front, and open at the back, contained one man to drive, \nand two or three others to fight - all standing up.  The horses who \ndrew them were so well trained, that they would tear, at full \ngallop, over the most stony ways, and even through the woods; \ndashing down their masters\' enemies beneath their hoofs, and \ncutting them to pieces with the blades of swords, or scythes, which \nwere fastened to the wheels, and stretched out beyond the car on \neach side, for that cruel purpose.  In a moment, while at full \nspeed, the horses would stop, at the driver\'s command.  The men \nwithin would leap out, deal blows about them with their swords like \nhail, leap on the horses, on the pole, spring back into the \nchariots anyhow; and, as soon as they were safe, the horses tore \naway again.\n\nThe Britons had a strange and terrible religion, called the \nReligion of the Druids.  It seems to have been brought over, in \nvery early times indeed, from the opposite country of France, \nanciently called Gaul, and to have mixed up the worship of the \nSerpent, and of the Sun and Moon, with the worship of some of the \nHeathen Gods and Goddesses.  Most of its ceremonies were kept \nsecret by the priests, the Druids, who pretended to be enchanters, \nand who carried magicians\' wands, and wore, each of them, about his \nneck, what he told the ignorant people was a Serpent\'s egg in a \ngolden case.  But it is certain that the Druidical ceremonies \nincluded the sacrifice of human victims, the torture of some \nsuspected criminals, and, on particular occasions, even the burning \nalive, in immense wicker cages, of a number of men and animals \ntogether.  The Druid Priests had some kind of veneration for the \nOak, and for the mistletoe - the same plant that we hang up in \nhouses at Christmas Time now - when its white berries grew upon the \nOak.  They met together in dark woods, which they called Sacred \nGroves; and there they instructed, in their mysterious arts, young \nmen who came to them as pupils, and who sometimes stayed with them \nas long as twenty years.\n\nThese Druids built great Temples and altars, open to the sky, \nfragments of some of which are yet remaining.  Stonehenge, on \nSalisbury Plain, in Wiltshire, is the most extraordinary of these.  \nThree curious stones, called Kits Coty House, on Bluebell Hill, \nnear Maidstone, in Kent, form another.  We know, from examination \nof the great blocks of which such buildings are made, that they \ncould not have been raised without the aid of some ingenious \nmachines, which are common now, but which the ancient Britons \ncertainly did not use in making their own uncomfortable houses.  I \nshould not wonder if the Druids, and their pupils who stayed with \nthem twenty years, knowing more than the rest of the Britons, kept \nthe people out of sight while they made these buildings, and then \npretended that they built them by magic.  Perhaps they had a hand \nin the fortresses too; at all events, as they were very powerful, \nand very much believed in, and as they made and executed the laws, \nand paid no taxes, I don\'t wonder that they liked their trade.  \nAnd, as they persuaded the people the more Druids there were, the \nbetter off the people would be, I don";
