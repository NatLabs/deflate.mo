Do not remove this.\n\n\n**Welcome To The World of Free Plain Vanilla Electronic Texts**\n\n**Etexts Readable By Both Humans and By Computers, Since 1971**\n\n*These Etexts Prepared By Hundreds of Volunteers and Donations*\n\nInformation on contacting Project Gutenberg to get Etexts, and\nfurther information is included below.  We need your donations.\n\n\nA Child\'s History of England\n\nby Charles Dickens\n\nOctober, 1996  [Etext #699]\n\n\n**The Project Gutenberg Etext of A Child\'s History of England**\n*****This file should be named achoe10.txt or achoe10.zip******\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, achoe11.txt.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, achoe10a.txt.\n\n\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\nof the official release dates, for time for better editing.\n\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A\npreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment\nand editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an\nup to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes\nin the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has\na bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a\nlook at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a\nnew copy has at least one byte more or less.\n\n\nInformation about Project Gutenberg (one page)\n\nWe produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The\nfifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text\nfiles per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\ntotal should reach 80 billion Etexts.\n\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\nFiles by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\nwhich is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001\nshould have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it\nwill require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.\n\n\nWe need your donations more than ever!\n\n\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/BU\":  and are\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law. (BU = Benedictine\nUniversity).  (Subscriptions to our paper newsletter go to BU.)\n\nFor these and other matters, please mail to:\n\nProject Gutenberg\nP. O.
